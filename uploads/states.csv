(Photo by Clay Wirestone/Kansas Reflector)What does it mean to fold a dryer’s full of clothes? That might seem like a question of no import. But if you ponder it, I suspect your mind will eventually wander back to someone in your family.
Humans usually don’t figure out how to fold clothes on our own. Someone shows us how. Someone shows us how to bisect a pair of pants, smooth the legs together, then turn the entire affair into a zigzag. Eventually, you have a compact rectangle of slack or jean or chino.

Little things
Small essays on simple subjects.
Read the archive.

What about a towel? How many times do we turn it over and across? How small do we make that resulting square? Your mother or father or grandmother likely had strong opinions on the subject, perhaps linked to cupboard size. 
The most challenging items to fold are, of course, shirts. No method of folding shirts makes sense. I learned to fold the shirt vetically and reach both of the arms out as though the wearer was serving a volleyball. (Sometimes the arms naturally reach backward, as though the wearer was being arrested.) Then I folded the arms back toward the shirt and bisect the entire thing.
If you think that description’s confusing, try folding some shirts!
We don’t really have a vocabulary for a practice so basic and ingrained. We learn how to fold them, then we do it for the rest of our lives. Perhaps we squabble over who tackles the next batch. But we don’t focus on the folding itself. The knowledge stays locked inside us like the half-remembered melody of a song, activated when we hear the tune or pick up the rainbow sweater vest.
Clothes don’t have to be folded. You can always put them on a hangers. No item of clothing works better on a hanger than a long-sleeved shirt. A coat comes in a close second because there’s really no other place to put it except a hook, and that stretches out the back of its collar.
You can also leave them in a pile on the floor. This method, while supremely efficient and easy to understand, has faced rejection from mothers in law and neatness-obsessed roommates the world over. I’m not sure what their problem is.
For a brief time, I dry cleaned my clothes. When I moved back to Kansas to work at The Topeka Capital-Journal, I decided that I was going to wear suits every day to work. I like this as a concept: the suit works marvelously as a uniform suggesting formality and elegance. I don’t know that it worked, but I like to imagine that it did.
The suits had to be maintained, however, which meant regular trips to the dry cleaner a few blocks from my home. (Post pandemic, that branch of the cleaner has closed.) I loved the concept of outsourcing the entire operation — cleaning, folding and hanging.
The suits didn’t last. We were raising a kindergartner at the time, and the house was usually turned upside down for one reason or another. Career changes came soon after. I blinked a couple of times and there I was in the laundry room again, taking out a fresh batch of warm clothes and folding them one by one.
There are, I suppose, worse ways to spend a weekend afternoon. And I can always go back to the suits.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Choosing the top political stories in an “off year” when no statewide elections took place is challenging — although jockeying for the 2026 elections is well under way. Property taxes and gun rights, meanwhile, have emerged as issues likely to dominate the 2026 legislative session, which kicks off in a little more than two weeks.
Donald Trump endorses Byron Donalds (Feb. 20)
With Ron DeSantis now in lame-duck status, one of the biggest stories in Florida politics was to whom would the Republicans run to succeed him. While names like Matt Gaetz, Ashley Moody, Casey DeSantis, Jimmy Patronis, and Jeanette Nuñez were bandied about early on, many of them became no longer viable for various reasons as the year progressed.
Byron Donalds was among those always in the mix, but his candidacy went into the stratosphere after President Trump endorsed him in a Truth Social post, before the Naples Republican had even formally entered the contest. “RUN, BYRON, RUN!” POTUS wrote and, less than a week later, Donalds announced his candidacy.
Since then, he’s never looked back in the polls and, with more than $40 million raised to date, is dwarfing both his Republican and Democratic opponents. Can any candidate catch him? That’ll be the story of the year in Florida politics in 2026.
The Hope Florida story breaks (April 11)
The Tallahassee bureau for the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald broke the Hope Florida story during the middle of the legislative session. If nothing else, the affair amplified the already cold war brewing between Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office and the Florida House of Representatives.
The story reported that just weeks after the administration steered $10 million from a Medicaid legal settlement to the Hope Florida Foundation — the entity led by Casey DeSantis designed to connect Floridians in need with government resources, nonprofits, the private sector, and religious organizations — in the fall of 2024.
The foundation moved those funds to two nonprofit groups (Save Our Society from Drugs, or SOS, and Securing Florida’s Future). Those groups then routed those funds to Keep Florida Clean, a political action committee created to beat the proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational cannabis in the state.

The story electrified the Capitol, and was immediately denounced as a political hit job by DeSantis designed to hurt him and the first lady. Hearings were held in the House of Representatives, and in October a Leon County grand jury began investigating the allegations. No indictments or final reports have been issued.
DeSantis appoints Ashley Moody to the U.S. Senate (Jan. 16); Blaise Ingoglia as CFO (July 16); Jay Collins as lieutenant governor (Aug. 12)
Call it the DeSantis Legacy Project. While the governor has just a year left in office, he’s been able to appoint people close to him to positions of power in the state that could shape Floridians’ lives long after he moves out of the Governor’s Mansion.

The governor undoubtedly had many worthy Republicans he could have appointed to replace Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate. He chose a close ideological partner in Attorney General Ashley Moody. He then quickly replaced her in the Cabinet position with his former chief of staff, James Uthmeier.
He took much more time before selecting two of his then-closest allies in the Florida Senate — Blaise Ingoglia and Jay Collins — to succeed Jimmy Patronis as CFO and Jeanette Nuñez as his lieutenant governor, respectively.
DeSantis and Ingoglia have been singing off the same sheet music in the past half-year in their campaign to eliminate or substantially reduce property taxes in Florida in 2026. And while just as conservative as Moody, Uthmeier has embraced picking fights that capture headlines — not a bad strategy as he goes before voters for the first time in his life in 2026. Whether his involvement in the Hope Florida saga lifts his candidacy next year remains to be seen.
And Collins? When DeSantis named him as LG in August in Tampa, the governor hailed him as “the Chuck Norris of Florida politics.” Political observers speculated it was a matter of when, not if, the governor would endorse him to take on Donalds for governor next year.
That DeSantis endorsement hasn’t happened, however, and despite the millions of dollars in TV ads that aired over the past month on college football Saturdays and the Sunday morning political talk shows, Collins apparently still wasn’t ready to announce his candidacy at the end of the year. Will he do so in 2026?
Immigration (Jan. 7)
No governor was more excited about Donald Trump’s campaign pledge for mass deportations during his second go-round at the White Hose than Ronald Dion DeSantis.
Screenshot of AI-generated image posted on the official White House X account on July 1, 2025, promoting the “Alligator Alcatraz” name given to the immigrant detention center in the Everglades.
The governor surprised state lawmakers when he said just days into the New Year that he wanted to call a special session on immigration ahead of the regular legislative session.
“We’ve done a lot. We passed a major bill in 2023, but I think that there needs to be some additional legislation to help complement the federal government’s now–newfound appreciation to stop illegal immigration, and to hold people accountable. … We need to be prepared to act. I don’t think that you can wait until April or May to do something in that respect,” he said.
That led to the first of what would be many clashes with the Florida House and Speaker Danny Perez, when the Perez declaring he saw no need to hold a special session just then. Senate President Ben Albritton also initially rejected the call.
“It is completely irresponsible to get out ahead of any announcements President Trump will make, especially when uninformed or ill-timed state action could potentially impair or impede the success of President Trump’s forthcoming efforts to end illegal immigration, close our borders, and protect the sovereignty of our nation,” Albritton and Perez wrote in response.
Ultimately, the Legislature and DeSantis did come together on an anti-illegal immigration package in mid-February that included a provision making it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
That measure was blocked by a federal judge in Miami, who later found Attorney General James Uthmeier in contempt of court for referring to the court’s order blocking the law as illegitimate and unlawful.
The state made international news in the summer with the unveiling of a federal detention center in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” In December, Amnesty International said in a report that facility as well as the federal Krome North Services Processing Center may have violated international standards by imposing conditions that could amount to torture of detainees,
The Florida Legislature passes and Gov. DeSantis signs HB 1205, making it significantly harder to pass citizen-led constitutional amendments (May 2)

“This is the most important bill that we will be hearing in this chamber,” Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman said about HB 1205 when the bill came before the chamber during the last week of the regularly scheduled legislative session earlier this year. “And as you’ve heard, it’s going to greatly restrict the access of the citizens of the state of Florida to be able to address the system.”
The bill was driven by the zeal of Gov. DeSantis, who announced at the beginning of the year that it was a top legislative priority for him. As the Phoenix reported at the time, the governor and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature argued that the measure was needed to combat signature petition fraud that they alleged had been exposed last year in the campaigns to pass constitutional amendments regarding legalizing recreational marijuana and abortion rights.
Floridians narrowly failed to pass the two constitutional amendments that DeSantis fiercely opposed. The effects have become apparent this year, with groups that had hoped to place amendments on the ballot throwing in the towel because of the tougher requirements. And it’s also threatened a new effort by Trulieve and others in the medical marijuana industry in Florida to get a new constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2026.
Democratic Senate Leader Jason Pizzo quits the Florida Democratic Party (April 24)
It was another difficult year for the Florida Democratic Party, which faces a more than 1.4 million voter registration disadvantage to the Republican Party at year end.
Pizzo’s stunned his colleagues and the political establishment in Tallahassee when he declared on the Senate floor that he was done with the Democratic Party, proclaiming it was “dead.” “But there are good people that can resuscitate it, but they don’t want it to be me.”
Two months after his departure, Chair Nikki Fried declared that “our message is s***,” during the Florida Democratic Party’s Leadership Blue gala in Broward County. “Our brand is broken. But quitting, hiding, waiting, or whining will not fix it. What will? Showing up.”
So, the question is going into the 2026 cycle is, will Florida Democrats show up at the ballot box a year from now? And can that make a difference? Nationally, the depression surrounding the party following Donald Trump’s election over Kamala Harris has appeared to dissipate, based on the results of the few major elections this fall. But as was the case going back to 2018 during Trump’s first reign in office, will a “blue wave” even make it to the Sunshine State?
Democrats were heartened in the spring when their two candidates running in special congressional elections lost by “only” 15 points in Florida’s First Congressional District and 14 points in the Sixth District.

The Sixth District seat was won by Republican Randy Fine over Democrat Josh Weil, who stunned political observers by raising more than $15 million in a race that the GOP incumbent in November of 2024 (Mike Waltz) had won by 33 points.
Weil announced in June that would run for the party’s nomination for U.S. Senate in 2026 against Moody, and boasted that his team would raise $10 million on its own for voter registration efforts in Florida leading up to the 2026 election, with an emphasis on Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties. Unfortunately for him and the party, Weil announced a little over a month later that he was dropping out of the race because of health concerns.
The party closed out the year on an up note, with Eileen Higgins becoming the first registered Democrat to become mayor of Miami since the 1990s. Fried notably praised Democrats, Republicans, and independents for Higgins’ big victory, because the party is going to need those voters not registered with the party to make an impact at the ballot box next year.
Former GOP U.S. Rep. David Jolly and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings now look to be in a competitive battle for the party’s nomination for governor in 2026.
Local governments and citizens express revulsion towards Senate Bill 180 (Sept. 29)
The latest blow to local growth management laws in Florida was passage of Senate Bill 180 earlier this year. The measure effectively freezes local land-development regulations and comprehensive plans through October 2027. It didn’t generate much controversy during the legislative session, because for most of its movement through committees it was perceived as a thoughtful measure to help local residents recover from the devastating hurricanes Helene and Milton in the fall of 2024.

Calling it the “largest incursion into local home rule authority” since adoption of the Florida Constitution in 1968, 25 local governments have gone to court to try to block the law that restricts local governments from regulating development.
At the heart of the anger of local governments are two specific parts of the bill that freeze cities and counties from adopting land-use regulations considered “more restrictive or burdensome” than those in place before the recent (or future) hurricanes, even if the changes are unrelated to disaster recovery.
During a Manatee County legislative delegation meeting in Bradenton in late October, several citizens blasted state lawmakers, saying they had “betrayed” them in voting for the legislation.
Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie said his motivation for the legislation was to ensure that local governments prepare and respond better to natural disasters than they did a year ago. In December, he filed a bill (SB 840) to scale back some the effects of SB 180 that will be heard in the 2026 session.

Will Florida become the first state in the country to eliminate property taxes?
That’s the scenario that Gov. DeSantis appears determined to to leave as one of his most important policy achievements before he leaves the governor’s mansion for parts unknown.
The governor made it clear during the 2025 legislative session that he’d prefer Floridians with homesteaded properties receive a tax break at the same time that the House and Senate was debating how big of a sales tax the state could afford as an alternative.
His advocacy picked up steam after he appointed close ally Blaise Ingoglia to replace Jimmy Patronis as the state’s chief financial officer. Ingoglia travelled around the state with his Florida DOGE (later rebranded as FAFO) team to accuse some of the biggest (and not so big) local governments in the state that they had indulged in millions of dollars of wasted spending — in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars.
Ingoglia’s efforts were a prebuttal to expected complaints from local officials that a major reduction in property tax revenues would deplete vital services for their residents. “I think there is more than enough room to cut local budgets, probably by the amount of 15%, and not even worry about taking away any money for essential services,” he said during a debate at the University of South Florida in November.
Reducing or removing property taxes can only be done by the public via a constitutional amendment. The question is, how many bills to do the job? DeSantis said at a press conference in Tampa in late October that he wanted only one to go before the voters next year. He blasted the eight separate proposals (including seven resolutions that would be constitutional amendments) proposed by the Florida House as “milquetoast,” with “not one proposal that would get people excited about.”
House members say they’re still waiting for DeSantis to offer any specific language for property tax relief.
Florida appeals court declares the state’s ban on open carry unconstitutional (Sept. 10)
For having the reputation as being one of the least regulated states in the country when it comes to firearms (“The gunshine state,” anyone?) Florida had been one of just a handful of states that banned the open carrying of firearms in the country.
No longer.
A three-judge panel of the Florida First District Court of Appeal ruled in September that the 1987 law banning open carry was unconstitutional — a ruling cheered by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.
“Our office fully supports the Court’s decision,” he said on X. “This is a big win for the Second Amendment rights of Floridians.”
Days after the ruling, Uthmeier said that reinterpreting the law based on the court’s ruling was “not the cleanest solution and there’s likely cleanup that’s going to be needed by the Legislature.”
An implementing bill is likely, but Second Amendment advocates say they’re concerned about how far that might go.
“Members of Florida Gun Rights stand united and strong against any potential infringements on the recent ruling which declared Florida’s ban on open carry as unconstitutional,” Logan Edge of that organization told the Phoenix.
“The Legislature remains a hostile opponent against gun rights and open carry but, after many years of pushback, gun owners gained a massive victory in the courts,” he added. “We will make sure every Tallahassee legislator hears from gun rights activists and oppose any effort to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.”
Congressional redistricting (Dec. 4)
In advance of the 2020 U.S. Census, the state’s congressional delegation breakdown was 16 Republicans and 11 Democrats.
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ own congressional redistricting map (later declared by the courts to be constitutional) resulted in the GOP gaining four additional seats, taking a 20-8 lead (the state was awarded an additional seat in the Census).
Now, after President Donald Trump called on Texas to redraw its congressional districts to guarantee him an additional five Republican seats as he fears losing the House to the Democrats in 2026, other states have been following suit, with the Sunshine State only now beginning such efforts.
Gov. DeSantis and the Legislature appear to be in lockstep, with the only dispute so far being the timing: The House wants to come up with a new map by time the regular legislative session ends in mid-March, while the governor and now the Senate want them to wait and focus on the matter during a special session later in the spring.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-9-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-26 00:11:47.334037

The federal funds covering the cost of the move came through this fall, but for several months earlier this year, it was unclear whether that would happen.
In 2023, a severe storm damaged Ayer Hall’s HVAC system and a few floors where many of the center’s archives and cultural artifacts are stored. In November 2024, the Margaret Walker Center staff applied for a $317,039 federal grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to cover relocating the historic materials while Ayer Hall is renovated. IMLS is a small federal agency that supports museums, libraries and cultural institutions across the country.
Then in March, President Donald Trump issued an executive order requiring the IMLS and other federal agencies to scale down to “the minimum presence.” At IMLS, nearly 70 employees  were placed on administrative leave at the small federal agency, which supports museums, libraries and cultural institutions across the country.
When the IMLS team was placed on leave, the Margaret Walker Center staff was left in limbo about their grant. After nearly six months of uncertainty, the center received its IMLS grant in September. 
“We couldn’t be more grateful,” said Angela Stewart, an archivist at the center. 
The Margaret Walker Center funding will also help cover the cost of professional development workshops with a focus on boosting museum operations and management.

Maintaining cultural institutions like the Margaret Walker Center requires funding that goes beyond the price of admission or local tax dollars, said Sen. Hillam Frazier, a Democrat from Jackson and a 1974 JSU alumnus. In states like Mississippi, where access to resources and support for cultural institutions may be meager, funding has been essential in preserving state history, he said.  
“It is a godsend to get this money, the tools and resources for an institution like the Margaret Walker Center at Jackson State,” Frazier said. “Museums and libraries are sometimes the only access to education that people may have where they can further explore their curiosity and areas of interests, as well as know their history.”
The importance of the history
After the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, Margert Walker Alexander, an accomplished poet and writer, founded the Institute for the Study of the History, Life, and Culture of Black People at what was then Jackson State College. 
At the time, universities and colleges across the country were adding Black history departments, courses and programs to their curriculum as a result of student activism from the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. 
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, who knew Walker and attended Tougaloo College in the 1970s with her son Sigismund Walker Alexander, remembers admiring her “spirit and commitment to writing about Black people and Black life in the Deep South.” Walker was a pivotal figure in the movement to establish Black intellectual and academic studies,  he said. 
“She aspired for the institute to reflect her passion as an academic, artist and activist, and the university commended her preservation efforts,” said Thompson, a 1972 JSU alumnus.
When Walker retired in 1979 after 30 years as an English professor at Jackson State, the university honored her by renaming the cultural center after her. 
The center is also home to important collections and memorabilia from notable Black Mississippians such as a collection from William Lamson an architect and analyst for court cases dealing with school desegregation, voting rights, housing discrimination and judicial redistricting. Another example is a collection from Rod Paige, the first Black U.S.  secretary of education who was also an interim president of JSU, That collection includes memoranda, reports, speeches, scrapbooks and papers reflecting on Paige’s role during George W. Bush’s presidency. Paige died Dec. 9.
“There’s so much history of Black people in Mississippi that is in danger of being lost, so it’s important to keep funding and supporting these institutions to preserve her legacy but also the works associated with it,” Thompson said. 
Stewart, the archivist, said it was important to Walker to provide space for people to “learn how to think and be curious” rather than being told how to think. The importance of preserving archival work at the center helps engage visitors and students in research, scholarship and history. 
“We have to know who we are and where we’re going,” Stewart said. “That’s the importance of history. And archives do that.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13120146/3X0A4990.jpg,,,2025-12-25 09:56:52.975813

(Hongjie Han/Getty Images)This time of year is when Anna Walker, who directs the Western Firefly Project in New Mexico, gets a few false reports in her inbox.
Well-meaning people, mostly in Albuquerque and other urban areas, see flashes of yellow light dancing through trees and become convinced they’ve seen a firefly. What they actually see is a laser beam that’s part of a high-tech Christmas display.
“They project light up into trees and make the lights kind of move around,” Walker told Source New Mexico. “Those fool a lot of people.”

False reports are one common challenge for the community science initiative chasing the elusive New Mexico firefly. Another is convincing the public that fireflies exist here at all. Christy Bills, an entomologist at the University of Utah, started the Utah Firefly Project 11 years ago, partially in response to the “assumption that we don’t have any” fireflies in the West, she told Source NM. Back then, she and a colleague launched a project with a website that solicited firefly sightings from the public and got a flood of responses. 
“We realized they were everywhere. They’re all over the state, and so we just kept tracking them and getting repeat confirmation about certain populations,” she said. “But the project expanded outside of Utah, because we were getting reports from Idaho and Wyoming and Nevada and Colorado and New Mexico.”
Bills decided to partner with institutions in other states to help verify reports. That’s how she met Walker, an invertebrate species survival specialist at the New Mexico BioPark Society. Walker was eager to join the effort, she said, partially because she didn’t know fireflies existed in Western states, apart from old references in museum collections. 
“That’s what drew me to this firefly journey, was that such a charismatic insect could exist without most people even knowing about it, because they haven’t been studied hardly at all,” she said. “Pretty much every time you go out into the field, there’s like a discovery waiting to be found.”
Fireflies are here if you know where to look, Bills and Walker insist. Since launching in New Mexico in 2021, Walker has confirmed 13 firefly occurrences from more than 100 reports. She’s also collected 27 specimens that she entered into the collection at the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico. 
According to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, which touts itself as an open access database of “types of life on Earth,” four confirmed sightings of Photinus pyralis, the Common Eastern Firefly, have occurred in New Mexico since 2021. They all occurred between 8 p.m. and midnight in late June or early July in Northeastern New Mexico, specifically in Guadalupe, San Miguel and the border between Mora and Harding counties, according to the database. 
That is just one of at least 13 species of firefly that Walker says exist in New Mexico, though only a four or five are of the flickering, flying variety. Others are glow worms, and others are “dark fireflies” that never bioluminesce but share common ancestry with flashing fireflies, Walker said.

Of the 13 confirmed occurrences, three are “state records,” Walker said, which means she made the first confirmed sighting of a particular species in New Mexico, and they are still investigating whether several of the sightings are of new species.
But even as Walker sets out to confirm sightings and make new discoveries, she fears climate change is drying up the wetlands that nourish fireflies. For example, she got reports of fireflies in Gallinas Creek near Las Vegas but she was unable to find any after the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire occurred there in early 2022.  
“I worry that declines due to drought and forest fires may be responsible for our inability to find these populations,” she said. 
But she said will continue tracking down reports of fireflies, even if she’s initially skeptical, because of what happened right after she joined Bills’ project. 
Back on July 3, 2021, Walker set out to confirm a sighting of the Common Eastern Firefly, her fourth or fifth outing. The species  had never been reliably confirmed in New Mexico since the 1920s. The report came from someone in Mills Canyon, which rises on either side of the Rio Grande north of Roy, New Mexico, far from light pollution and under a wide open starry night.
Hundreds of fireflies greeted her, she said. It’s the biggest population she’s ever seen in New Mexico. 
“I don’t even know how to describe what the feeling was. I think it was just, like, awe, with nature again.

Coastal Carolina University is asking state legislators to set aside $390,000 annually in the state budget to start the Teal Works Program at the Horry County college. And Lander University in Greenwood is asking for $500,000 to add stipends to its existing internship program.

“Teal Works removes financial barriers and equips students with the skills and experiences necessary to thrive in the workforce,” Coastal wrote in its budget request. “The program will strengthen the talent pipeline, support local and regional economic development, and increase CCU’s visibility as a leader in preparing students for South Carolina’s workforce needs.”
Coastal plans to start out with $3,000 stipends for 75 students to cover a 10- to 12-week summer internship. Students who go to work in rural or underserved areas of the state can apply for an additional $1,000, according to the school’s budget ask.
The aid is not a loan. Students don’t pay it back. And it’s on top of what the companies hiring the students as interns might be paying.
By year five, the school hopes to get to 250 students, supported through a combination of state, federal and private funds.
Coastal will focus on placing students in high-demand industries, such as health care, education, information technology, manufacturing, agribusiness and hospitality.
The “Experience Your Education” Program has been operating at Lander for about 15 years, according to the university’s website.
Historically, participating students have received academic credits. Those who earn 120 credit hours can graduate with the Golden EYE Award. But now the school hopes to pay students who participate to help cover travel, meals and other summer living expenses.
“Internships provide invaluable educational experiences for college students, and satisfy course credit,” spokesman Graham Duncan said. “Yet, without financial support, many students often feel that these experiences are out of reach.”
Duncan also touted Lander’s record of students staying in South Carolina to work after graduation — 82% of the school’s alumni call the Palmetto State home.
“At Lander, we take seriously our responsibility to educate today’s students for tomorrow’s workforce,” Duncan said. “We believe this is a sound investment for South Carolina.”
Lander’s proposal did not give a dollar amount for its stipends or specify how many it plans to offer.
At Clemson University, the career center had been helping about 30 students each summer find internships. But in summer 2024, with an influx of state funding, that number jumped to more than 400 students, Neil Burton, the executive director of Clemson’s Center for Career and Professional Development previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
State stipends help nearly 2,100 SC college students land internships

“The challenge for a lot of students is there’s an upfront cost they think they can’t afford,” Britton said. “Paying the upfront deposit on an apartment while you’re buying a suit and trying to figure out how to get a car to go there may seem like minor things for a lot of folks. But for a lot of students, it’s prohibitive.”
USC also offers $3,000 to students who participate in internships within high-demand industries in the state, such as aerospace, automotive, energy, financial services, healthcare, insurance and manufacturing.
More than 1,750 students across the USC college system have participated, according to a statement from the university. The school awarded more than $5.2 million in stipends.
Updated numbers were not immediately available from Clemson. But as of last January, the Upstate school had given out a little less than $2 million to 1,151 students, according to a previous report from the university. 
Until this year, the programs at USC and Clemson were funded with surplus proceeds from the state lottery.
For the state budget that started in July, legislators approved $2 million for USC and $4 million for Clemson from the state tax collections. Those recurring dollars will continue in future budgets indefinitely.
USC is now asking for an additional $2.5 million annually to bring the program back up to previous funding levels.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Co-op-Industry-Expo_051224_SL_0018-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-25 09:12:42.303963

California schools are likely to face continuing threats of funding cuts and more uncertainty.


Last year was tumultuous for California K-12 schools and their 5.8 million students — at least at the federal level. President Donald Trump slashed funding to schools, set about dismantling the U.S. Department of Education and launched an immigration crackdown that left countless families afraid to send their children to school.
The state pushed back against these moves, successfully fighting the funding cuts in court. But the uncertainty continues as the White House seeks ways to reshape public K-12 education. After-school programs, teacher training and Head Start are among the programs that remain at risk of funding cuts. Congress cut extra funding to rural schools last year, but advocates are hopeful it will return in 2026.
But there were bright spots in 2025. Test scores surged after years of post-pandemic malaise. Reading and math achievement still lags behind pre-COVID-19 levels, but education officials welcomed the improvements after years of investments in tutoring and student wellbeing.
Transitional kindergarten expanded to include all 4-year-olds. Now nearly every district in California offers free, play-based classes for children to learn their A-B-Cs and 1-2-3s and otherwise prepare for the rigors of elementary school. The expansion gives California the largest early education system in the country.
In hopes of boosting reading scores, California also rolled out a mandatory dyslexia screener and passed a law to overhaul literacy instruction. The new curriculum doesn’t go into effect until 2028, but many schools are already implementing and using the dyslexia screener to get extra help to children who struggle with reading disorders.
California also passed a law creating an Office of Civil Rights, intended to eliminate discrimination in K-12 schools, especially antisemitism. The new law, which stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents statewide, is expected to provide more transparency and accountability in how schools handle discrimination complaints.
Looking ahead
Immigration raids, federal funding volatility and culture war issues are expected to continue playing out in K-12 schools next year. The fate of the U.S. Department of Education will also affect schools, especially special education and civil rights. 
California’s budget outlook is murky, as well. Gov. Gavin Newsom has largely spared K-12 schools from funding cuts the past few years, but that may change this year as the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office predicts an $18 billion deficit. 
On the academic front, schools are expecting to see reading and math scores improve as the state rolls out new curricula. Politically, voters will be electing a new State Superintendent of Public Instruction to replace Tony Thurmond, who terms out in 2026 after eight years in the job. A slew of candidates have already jumped in the race, including former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/052125_Paradise-School-Mental-Health_MG_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-25 08:56:21.006924

In their approach to higher education, Trump and Newsom shared one thing in common this year: reducing funding for colleges and universities. The federal government pulled back research funds while the state, facing a deficit, imposed austerity measures on the UC and Cal State University systems.


Money is power. If California’s public colleges and universities didn’t already know that, they certainly learned it this year. 
Though the U.S. Department of Justice launched numerous high-profile complaints against California schools — allegations of antisemitism at University of California campuses and concerns about a transgender athlete at San Jose State, to name a few — the most punishing consequences came from federal funding cuts. In its crusade to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs, the Trump administration cut funding for UC campuses, including research into dementia, coronavirus vaccines and HIV prevention.
UCLA bore the brunt of Trump’s ire. The Trump administration withheld over $500 million in UCLA research grants this year because of allegations that the campus wasn’t addressing antisemitism related to protests over the war in Gaza. The administration then demanded that UCLA pay a $1.2 billion settlement and forego certain academic freedoms in order to get the money back. In separate lawsuits, a U.S. district judge ordered the Trump administration to stop withholding funds and later said the proposed settlement was “coercive and retaliatory.”
It’s just one of several court rulings ordering the Trump administration to return research money to UCLA or other UC campuses. 
But the bulk of funding for California’s public colleges and universities comes from the state, not the federal government. After years where the state’s higher education system benefitted from a state surplus or was spared from budget cuts, 2025 proved different. 
Both the UC and the California State University system saw 3% reductions in funding this year, though the community college system emerged largely unscathed. Facing particularly severe cuts, Sonoma State tried to cut majors, such as economics and physics, and to slash its competitive athletic programs, only for a judge to halt many of the cuts. 
Looking ahead
Many of the court rulings issued this year were preliminary injunctions, meaning they’re temporary decisions until a final ruling occurs. That means many of the research grants could once again disappear. 
The Trump administration is also going after students without legal status, who have for decades been able to receive state financial aid and to pay in-state tuition at public universities. A November lawsuit could put an end to those financial aid programs, affecting as many as 100,000 students across the state. 
For the community college system, which educates the majority of students in California, the economy is often a key indicator in enrollment. If tariffs, a bursting tech bubble or other economic headwinds hit the state, students could return to college en masse, just like they did during the 2008 financial crisis.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092225_UC-San-Diego_AH_19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-25 08:56:21.006924

In a year marked by divisive rhetoric across the nation, those stories were among the most read on Utah News Dispatch’s website, along with announcements about homelessness, Sundance and decisions impacting kids. 
As news pushed the Beehive State into the national spotlight, here are some of the issues that rose to the top for Utah News Dispatch readers.

Fatal shooting as thousands march in Salt Lake City
As 10,000 Utahns joined in a nationwide No Kings demonstration protesting President Donald Trump’s policies and administration, shots rang out, sending the crowd fleeing and leaving one man dead.
When the chaos cleared, police said an armed volunteer, identifying himself as a “peacekeeper” for the event, had spotted a man with a rifle and shot at him, wounding him and hitting a bystander as he passed with the marchers. Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo died of his injuries, and the demonstrator with the rifle, who was legally permitted to carry his firearm in the protest, was released from jail without charges after nearly a week.
Months later, prosecutors publicly identified the armed volunteer, 43-year-old Matthew Scott Alder, and charged him with manslaughter, a second-degree felony. He is scheduled to make an initial court appearance Jan. 6.

Charlie Kirk assassinated at Utah Valley University
The first stop of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s “American Comeback Tour” was planned for Utah Valley University, where he would engage with students and the public in his signature “prove me wrong” question-and-answer debate. As he spoke at the campus’ open-air event, he was killed by a single shot that police say was fired by a lone gunman on a roof.
After a nearly three-day manhunt, Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Washington County resident, was arrested after family members and a family friend convinced him to turn himself in, according to police documents. Meanwhile, mourning for Kirk — and political and professional recrimination for those who spoke negatively about him — swept the nation.
Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder, a first-degree felony. Before he was even arrested, Utah officials were pledging to pursue a death penalty in the case, if he is convicted. As court hearings get underway, Robinson’s attorneys are pursuing restrictions on photos and videos of the proceedings.

Homeless services campus site revealed
For months, state officials searched for a site for what they say will be a centralized location for wraparound services for Utahns experiencing homelessness. When the news broke that they had landed on a location, reaction was swift and strong.
The site for the new 1,300-bed shelter is located at 2520 N. 2200 West, Salt Lake City. It’s an open field located directly west of I-215 and roughly a mile south from North Salt Lake’s city boundaries, in Salt Lake City’s Northpointe area. The small agricultural neighborhood lacks public transit and is far-flung from other services located around downtown.
The new homeless campus is envisioned by state homeless leaders to be a place where people experiencing homelessness can go for all of their services, all in one spot. But advocates have decried the strategy as a ploy to warehouse vulnerable Utahns out of sight and force people into mental health or drug treatment (and in an environmentally important zone, to boot). Surrounding neighbors also fear for what it means for their property values and public safety.

Sundance is out, and a flag ban is in
Two hot-button issues became intertwined in Utah this year — the announcement that the Sundance Film Festival will leave its home in Park City after more than 40 years, and legislation by Republican lawmakers banning most flags from classrooms and government buildings, notably LGBTQ+ banners. The Hollywood news site Deadline reported Utah’s flag ban could have tipped the scales out of the state’s favor.
Both developments drew dismay from the state’s Democrat-led capital city, even as Salt Lake City leaders came up with a loophole in the flag ban law. Meanwhile, some Republican legislators were eager to bid “Bye Felicia” to the film festival that they said doesn’t align with the state’s conservative values.
Sundance’s departure from Utah is a blow not just to local filmmakers, but also the state’s economy. In 2024, the Sundance Film Festival generated about $132 million in gross domestic product for Utah, 1,730 local jobs, $69.7 million in Utah wages, and $13.8 million in state and local tax revenue, according to an economic impact report.

Legislation, lawsuits and debates impacting youth
As lawmakers and state leaders prioritized issues impacting youth in 2025, several made the list of Utah News Dispatch’s most-read reports. 
Those included:

News that the company operating some of the most visited pornographic websites in the world, including Pornhub, agreed to pay Utah $5 million over allegations that it didn’t do enough to remove videos depicting rape, child sexual abuse and secret recordings. 
A bill to restrict the allowable age gap between an underage minor and his or her adult spouse, reducing the age difference to four years.
A debate among the Utah State Board of Education over whether schools were complying with a 2024 law restricting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in all public institutions.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker is proposing a bill that would require public high schools that participate in national signing to host signing days for military enlistment and trade schools alongside athletics.
Rep. Chad Robertson, R-Heflin, the sponsor of HB 75, said in a recent interview that he hopes it would help military recruitment and workforce development.
“We just wanted to make it even across the plane that, you know, if the schools are doing the [signing days] for athletes, then we do a signing day for the ones that are going in the military,” he said.

The move would come as branches of the armed forces try to improve overall recruitment While meeting recruiting goals in recent years, U.S. Army recruitment in 2022 missed its recruitment goal of 60,000 by nearly 25%. The U.S. Navy also missed its recruitment goal of 37,700 in 2023 by 20%.
“We just wanted to make it even across the plane that if the schools are doing the ones for athletes, then we do a signing day for the ones that are going in the military,” Robertson said. “It’s more of a signing day, though, for the military than would be for the technical because they actually do sign a contract at that point.” 
Robertson said there are other schools, such as Cleveland High School in Blount County, that have already implemented a system similar to what the bill proposes.
“They kind of just do everybody all at once and it’s kind of an awards day,” he said. “That was brought to my attention in the committee too, when I passed it through the Education Committee in the House that there were schools that were already celebrating this.”
Under the bill, schools would be required to provide “reasonable accommodations” for signing day, including but not limited to a space with seating and internet connectivity.
This is Robertson’s second time filing a bill similar to this. The bill passed unanimously in the House during the 2025 legislative session but failed to make it through the Senate because of time constraints. He said he doesn’t anticipate any pushback from legislators on this bill when they begin meeting Jan. 13.

Regional and statewide partners are making progress in developing the tools and know-how to respond to our collective flood risk. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Michael Gaughan and Katy Hansen: Vermont needs to get on the road to risk reduction.","This commentary is by Michael Gaughan, the executive director of the Vermont Bond Bank, and Katy Hansen, the director of the Rural and Small Cities Program at the Public Finance Initiative.



Vermont municipalities face a stark reality. The federal support that communities have relied on after disasters may be dramatically reduced in future years. The public will soon see the FEMA Review Council report, which is expected to recommend shifting more disaster response costs to states while also raising the dollar threshold for what qualifies as a federal disaster. Vermont is already confronting this reality with the recent denial of the July 2025 disaster declaration and the related on-again off-again funding for core infrastructure resilience programs.
For a state that has experienced over $240 million in FEMA related municipal damages from flooding in the past three years, the potential reduction in federal support threatens the fiscal and physical structures that undergird our communities. This is a staggering number, representing more than 30% of the Vermont Bond Bank’s current municipal loans, which obscures the threat to individual towns where disaster costs can be overwhelming. Take, for instance, towns such as Lyndon, where an estimated $18 million in damages occurred in 2024, roughly six times the town’s highway budget.

But this moment of uncertainty is an opportunity for Vermont to take matters into its own hands. Recently, the Bond Bank was selected to participate in the Public Finance Initiative’s Rural and Small Cities program, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to receive capacity building and educational support to develop clear guidance alongside our loan programs for communities to reduce the risks caused by extreme weather to their infrastructure. This builds on the Bond Bank’s decades of experience lending to local government and addressing challenges of infrastructure planning and finance. Our team of experts organized stakeholders from across the state to discuss how to spur action while coordinating resources. 
As others have noted and the FEMA report is anticipated to make clear, we must take responsibility ourselves and change practices to save Vermont from the inevitable. Thankfully, regional and statewide partners are making progress in developing the tools and know-how to respond to our collective flood risk. 
The convening helped the Bond Bank to highlight the largest potential contributor to post-disaster fiscal stress for our municipalities — our municipal roads. This network connects us to families, jobs, schools, grocery stores and hospitals, and is where more than 80% of municipal flood damage has occurred over the last 20 years. 
The Bond Bank’s goal is to use its understanding of public finance best practices and the helpful tools from partners like the Vermont League of Cities and Towns (VLCT) to drive the development of more capital plans and financial benchmarks that incorporate technical analyses from regional and state partners. Simple at its face, the effort is interdisciplinary and complex in practice. The convening was important to help the Bond Bank develop guidance and spur implementation. The Bond Bank aims to coordinate low-cost financing sources and expand the Municipal Climate Recovery Fund (MCRF) to help communities when disaster strikes. The intent is to turn the recovery cycle on its head: align existing resources to reduce risk before disasters strike and plan for more post-disaster relief.
The MCRF, established in partnership with the State and Treasurer’s Office, has already demonstrated its value. Since launching after the July 2023 floods, it has provided $33 million in loans at just 1.3% interest to 27 Vermont towns, offering seven-year terms with two years interest-only to give communities breathing room as they await potential federal reimbursement. This isn’t flashy, but the point is its practical value. For example, Lyndon received $4 million in MCRF loans that gave them space to deal with critical, immediate needs and time to sort through what the federal government would support.
With engagement from the partners at the convening, an expanded MCRF program, when combined with the capacity of our Vermont banks, would help address our vulnerable road infrastructure by aligning incentives for communities to plan, design and invest in improvements, and if disaster strikes, ensuring that communities can access resources through loans and adaptation grants to build back in the right way. 
This approach demands a shift in thinking. It means partners like the Bond Bank need to do everything we can to reduce costs for borrowers while also giving direction on how to take the first step in the financial trade-offs of implementing resilience projects. While this is hard work, it’s also empowering. Instead of waiting for federal aid that might never come, Vermont communities can reduce risk before disasters strike and build resilience on their own.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)I joined the Minnesota Reformer in April in a more regular capacity, as a photographer and social media runner, thanks to a grant from the Bush Foundation. I’ve been a freelancer for the past five years, and this is my first time belonging in some way to a newsroom since internship-hopping in college. It was a tumultuous and difficult year of coverage, and I’m grateful that this time I was able to weather that alongside the great journalists and friends here.
Below is a collection of photos from a year dense with tragedy and its necessary counterpart, resiliency.

May Day has long been a celebratory kind of resistance, with hundreds of people filling the streets with brightly-colored puppets and complex devices that could be pulled straight from Da Vinci’s sketchbooks. I was glad to cover this form of protest that leans into the absurd. As the year went on and inflatable frogs and unicorns joined the resistance movement, I was consistently reminded of this 50-years-strong day of song and protest.

The federal raid on Lake Street, the first of many clashes with the growing presence of the feds, was chaotic. Dozens of agents, armored vehicles, a kaleidoscopic array of agencies, and hundreds of protestors all packed into the blocks surrounding Las Cuatro Milpas under a constant rain.
It was impossible to tell from the ground why the agents were there, because so many agencies were involved and none would answer questions. I was grateful to the puppeteers of the Heart of the Beast, who let us file our story and photos in the shelter of the theater, soaked through and covered in pepper spray.
Thousands march to the Minnesota State Capitol for the nationwide No Kings day of protest, despite warnings from law enforcement against gathering following the assassination of Melissa and Mark Hortman Saturday, June 14, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)
On Saturday morning, while preparing to cover a No Kings day of protest, we heard the news that Melissa and Mark Hortman had been assassinated overnight. I didn’t believe it at first, until the rest of our newsroom confirmed it. Vance Boelter, the alleged assassin, was still on the loose, with No Kings signs photographed in his car.
The State Patrol advised people not to come. Thousands of people still showed up to protest, some with quickly-made signs honoring Hortman.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)
The march was suffused with anxiety to the point of paranoia. I saw demonstrators constantly checking their phones and trading information about the ongoing manhunt. Boelter had disguised himself as law enforcement, officials said. People kept coming up to me and other photographers, asking us to use our long lenses to check the legitimacy of law enforcement badges or to get a closer look at men with face coverings.

I was especially struck by the tribute Red Lake Drum Group gave to the Hortmans’ memory. Hundreds of people gathered tearfully on the State Capitol lawn as the sun set, candles flickering under the massive elm tree that Melissa Hortman adored. After the last drum was struck, Ta Pejuta Wichahpi Win held up a prayer stick, and the resounding silence that followed is burned into my memory.

Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, visited the site of the mass shooting at Annunciation. Pockets of protestors gathered along the vice presidential motorcade route.

Walkouts calling for a ban on assault rifles followed, under the promise of a special legislative session that never materialized.

Avid planespotter Nick Benson guided Madison McVan and I to the top of a parking garage at Minneapolis-Saint Paul Airport. We watched as agents methodically laid shackles out on the tarmac, then patted down detainees one at a time.
Even through the mile of atmosphere between us and the heat warping from passing jets, we could see the glint of shackles around their wrists, waists and ankles. Madison interviewed one of the men who was deported through MSP, who said that agents refused to say where they were being taken.

I was at Karmel Mall, a shopping center filled with Somali-owned businesses in south Minneapolis. I was searching for a cafe owner who freelancer Atra Mohamed had interviewed for a story about the downturn in foot traffic in the mall as people stayed away out of fear of ICE.
As I wandered the mall, multiple times business owners came out of their stalls, noticing my camera and my white face, and asked, “Are they here?” No introduction, no need to describe what they were referencing, just “Are they here?” Each time, I replied, “I’m sorry, I don’t know.”
But they were. Minutes after I left, agents detained several people, in one case smashing a car window to drag a person out. Here, you can see the broken glass sprayed over an unopened Taco Bell order.
Throughout what turned out to be a punishing year of violence, tragedy and chaos, the resistance movement remained strong. I would like for that to be my takeaway, but the year is ending on a raw note.
As I took an Uber to the airport to visit my family for Christmas, driving out of my neighborhood that’s now consistently filled with agents, the Somali driver told me about how for the first time in over a decade in America, he carries his passport all the time.
As we drove past the very spot where I’d watched shackled people marched onto a deportation plane in November, the driver said, “Pray for us, sister.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250603_0340-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-25 07:11:42.986944

(Getty Images)Your four-person Indiana Capital Chronicle team brought you a whopping 600 original stories during a busy year that featured a lively Statehouse and our first-ever staffing change.
We delivered play-by-plays of major legislative issues, from a mapping miss to budgetary brawls. We monitored top elected officials — misconduct included — and critical social services.
Before this year’s chapter in our story comes to a close, revisit your favorite and most important articles with us.
1. Map push dies
The Indiana Senate this month defied the wishes of President Donald Trump — despite a protracted national pressure campaign — when lawmakers there rejected a mid-census redraw of the state’s congressional maps.
The proposed maps were explicitly designed to bolster the GOP’s hold on the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections.
Trump kicked off the redistricting arms race in July, when he directed Texas to create five more GOP seats.
We began tracking the initiative: Vice President JD Vance’s visits to Indianapolis, Hoosier Republicans’ travel to the U.S. Capitol, closed-door caucuses and more.

The team logged gradual changes in Indiana Gov. Mike Braun’s stance as his wait-and-see approach shifted toward a special session dedicated to the redistricting effort.
And we covered lawmakers’ will-they-or-won’t-they decision on reconvening, which culminated in an early start to the 2026 session. The whole team — including new Deputy Editor Tom Davies — pitched in to analyze the proposed maps, man lengthy public hearings and probably irritate reticent lawmakers in our efforts to bring you the latest.
The Senate’s 31-19 defeat of the maps means the idea can’t be reconsidered until the 2027 session. Now, we’re following the short– and long-term political fallout.
2. Sheriff scrutiny
ICC’s mission, to fill in gaps in state-level coverage, sometimes takes us beyond the Government Center campus in Indianapolis.
Senior Reporter Casey Smith tackled the complicated story of a state investigation into a county sheriff’s alleged wrongdoing, finding that the only person disciplined was the detective who pursued the case.

And she followed up, reporting that a state law enforcement board is considering whether Dubois County Sheriff Tom Kleinhelter — who is accused of mishandling jail commissary funds and more — should be stripped of his police credentials.
Smith also kept tabs on a series she began last year on wrongdoing by former Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel, which prompted greater state oversight of jail commissary funds.
She catalogued the court-sanctioned sales of Noel’s misbegotten property — complete with pictures of his auctioned luxury cars and self-branded merchandise — as the disgraced man begins making good on restitution orders.
3. Economic development sunlight
Just before she went back east, landing at a sister outlet in Pennsylvania, former ICC Senior Reporter Whitney Downard wrapped up a contentious chapter for the state’s embattled economic development authority.
Over the spring, Braun’s administration launched a forensic analysis into spending by the Indiana Economic Development Corp. and its relationship with several partners. Downard broke down the substantial report, released in the fall, and reaction to it.
The results prompted a spate of accountability-oriented changes. IEDC’s board has revamped its conflict-of-interest policies, with screened members exiting the room for certain projects, and investment policies. Only the full board makes binding votes now. And the quasi-public agency’s nonprofit arm is going to “wind down,” officials have said, although that hasn’t been completed.
Braun wants to move on from damage control. IEDC is revving up a renewed focus on regional development.
4. Indiana governor’s first year
It was a tumultuous first year in office for Braun, who was inaugurated mid-January — after the General Assembly reconvened for legislative business.
Amid slower revenue growth, he led the push to slash state spending, signing the state’s latest biennial budget into law in April.
But he spent much of his political capital on a property tax relief plan that lawmakers weakened and subsumed into a behemoth local government finance law. Revisions are expected this session.
Despite mixed results on his property tax agenda and defeat on redistricting, Braun said year one still featured plenty of wins, during a sit-down interview with Reporter Leslie Bonilla Muñiz.

He highlighted the remake of IEDC and the commission that regulates utility services; the cuts to agency spending and a leadership reorganization; and boosts to education and public safety.
5. Your mileage may vary
Braun’s ascension to the Governor’s Residence in Indianapolis also sparked scrutiny on upgrades made to his family home in southwestern Indiana, and frequent travel between the two.
Downard broke the news of the state’s plans to spend at least $118,000 on security improvements to the house in Jasper. The work included a gravel helipad, fencing, gates and a trailer for a round-the-clock security detail staffed by Indiana State Police.

Braun is the first governor in recent decades to reside outside of central Indiana while in office. Former Govs. Eric Holcomb and Mike Pence made the Indianapolis estate their primary residence, while former Gov. Mitch Daniels split his time between that building and his home in Carmel.
Jasper and Indianapolis are located more than two hours apart by car — or, just 45 minutes by helicopter.
Downard also reported Braun took 11 helicopter rides to and from his Jasper home over about six months, costing almost $24,000. The state said that it would have incurred those costs regardless, because Indiana State Police pilots needed the flight hours to satisfy federal license maintenance requirements.
6. License plates boost budgets
That metal plate fastened to your vehicle can bring in big bucks for nonprofit groups and the state.
Bonilla Muñiz found Hoosiers pumped almost $200 million into charitable causes over two decades — just by buying and renewing special group recognition license plates.
But recently toughened sales and signature requirements may force organizations out of the program and block prospective participants from joining.
Seen those all-black plates on the road? Smith got a preview of the “blackout” designs, which have already generated millions of dollars for the state.
7. Former administration leader disciplined
Smith has also been on top of wrongdoing by one-time Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green, who resigned in September, repeatedly breaking news along the way.
The Indiana State Ethics Commission this month approved a settlement featuring a $10,000 civil fine for Green, finding she violated political activity and misuse of state property rules.
That approval closed the ethics case against Green, but potential criminal charges remain under review by the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office, Smith reported.
Smith and ICC Editor Niki Kelly were the first to report on a remediation document revealing Green was the subject of a state inspector general probe prior to her abrupt departure.
She’s still running for Congress again, though. Her campaign has called the investigation a “politically motivated sham.”
8. Social service cuts
The spending cuts undertaken after the lackluster springtime revenue forecast are hitting social services for impoverished Hoosiers, ICC reporting shows.
Indiana enrollment in Medicaid, the low-income health care program, has dropped by about 300,000 people throughout the year, totaling 1.7 million in November, according to the latest forecast, delivered this month. The dip comes as officials continue aggressive post-pandemic eligibility checks.
Lawmakers have also approved cost-controlling work mandates for the Healthy Indiana Plan, a Medicaid-expansion health insurance program for 700,000 low- to moderate-income Hoosiers. But it won’t take effect until 2027, when a federal law imposes such requirements on expansion enrollees nationwide.

And there are big changes coming for providers serving the 8,000 children who receive autism therapy through Medicaid. The state plans to reduce its hourly rate 10% and is considering other cost-cutting strategies for the fast-growing program.
Families who need help paying for child care have also struggled, as a state freeze on vouchers enters its second year. It’s creating enrollment crunches for providers, also hard-hit by the state’s significantly lower reimbursement rates.
Indiana additionally opted out of a summer meal program for hungry low-income schoolchildren. Downard broke that story, then followed up, reporting that a key agency and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith blamed the miss on poor planning by Holcomb’s outgoing administration.
9. Educational changes
Indiana schools saw mixed results this year.
Third-graders produced a historic jump in reading scores, but about 3,000 were held back for not meeting literacy proficiency standards.
Fewer students are missing large chunks of school, but chronic absenteeism rates still remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Smith, ICC’s education guru, broke down what a recent absenteeism law does.
Indiana has asked the U.S. Department of Education for permission to combine funding from 15-plus federal programs into one block grant, overhauling how the state spends and tracks billions in education aid.
Public higher educational institutions, meanwhile, reported enrollment gains but a lower college-going rate. They also axed or restructured hundreds of degree programs under a recent state law, and recorded millions of dollars in canceled federal research grants.
10. Two more executions
Indiana ended its 15-year execution pause last year after securing a new lethal drug. This year, the state put two more men to death.
Roy Lee Ward was executed in October for the 2001 rape and murder of teenager Stacy Payne. Benjamin Ritchie was executed in May, nearly 25 years after he killed Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney.
Details on both were sparse; no reporters were permitted to witness.
Death Penalty Action, a nonprofit that advocates against executions, encouraged protestors to ring the “Delaware Bell” as a sign of their opposition to the death penalty while gathered outside the Indiana State Prison on Monday, May 19, 2025, in Michigan City — ahead of the execution of Benjamin Ritchie. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Braun confirmed over the summer that Indiana spent more than $1 million on execution drugs. Three doses were purchased for $900,000 under Holcomb’s administration. Only one was utilized; the other two doses expired without use. Braun’s administration spent $275,000 on a fourth dose, used for Ritchie’s execution.
But his office has refused to disclose exactly how much the state paid for the latest three sets of lethal injection drugs purchased by the Department of Correction in recent months. At least one of those doses was expected to be used for Ward’s execution. The remaining sets expired at the end of October, according to court documents.
Five men remain on Indiana’s death row, but only four are currently considered competent for execution. No new inmates have been added since 2013, and capital prosecutions remain rare and costly.
Smith reports lawmakers are exploring other execution methods in new legislation. Braun told ICC he’ll “look at” whatever “comes up,” but said such measures “don’t rise to the level of” kitchen-table issues.

Charles Dickens MuseumLucy Whitehead, Royal Holloway, University of London

A Christmas Carol is usually read as a Victorian morality tale about capitalism and compassion. Yet an autographed script written by Charles Dickens during the American Civil War raises the possibility he may also have understood the story as speaking to the cause of ending slavery in the US.
First published in the UK on December 19 1843, the novella is famous for its advocacy of a reformed relationship between the Victorian capitalist Scrooge and the workers whose labour he profits from, epitomised by his downtrodden clerk, Bob Cratchit. The story has inspired countless adaptations in theatre, television and film.
However, a slip of blue paper held in Harvard’s Houghton Library shows how Dickens may have also seen the story through the lens of American slavery. As my current research in the library’s collections shows, on March 7 1864, Dickens wrote out and autographed A Christmas Carol’s most famous line so that it could be sold in aid of the anti-slavery side in the ongoing American civil war (1861–65).
The closing sentence – “And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God Bless Us, Every One!” – is usually associated with Victorian families united in the Christmas snow. However, Dickens’ contribution to a set of celebrity autographs being collected for sale at the 1864 New York Metropolitan Fair enlisted his novella in the cause of supporting the Union army’s goal of ending slavery in the US.
The New York fair was one of several events held across the Union states to raise funds for the US Sanitary Commission, a philanthropic organisation which promoted the health, welfare and convalescence of Union soldiers. We don’t know how much the autograph collection to which Dickens contributed ultimately sold for. But records show the collection, gathered by the wife of the US ambassador to Britain, Abigail Brooks Adams, was valued at US$1,000 – approximately US$20,000 (£14,500) in today’s money.
Dickens had been an international celebrity since the 1830s, and was well accustomed to requests for autographs. In 19th-century terms, this often meant a copied-out passage from one of his novels as well as a signature.
What survives of these autographs, written for fans in Britain and America, suggests that the passage he typically used was the death of Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841). His unusual choice of the final line from A Christmas Carol therefore seems deliberate for this specific context.
In my ongoing research, I theorise this choice may have been designed to remind people that the message of A Christmas Carol also applied to enslaved black people in the US and show his support for them.
While there are no direct references to slavery in A Christmas Carol, there are good reasons to think it was on Dickens’s mind at the time he was writing the novella.
The two works he was publishing immediately before it – the travel book American Notes (1842) and serialised novel Martin Chuzzlewit (1843–44) – both make vivid reference to the inhumanities of slavery. They had been inspired by the five-month tour that Dickens made of the US in 1842.
There is a long cultural history of ghosts in chains like the ones that weigh down Scrooge’s partner, Jacob Marley, in A Christmas Carol. But at the time Dickens was writing it, he also had a more immediate reference point for the image of people burdened by irons.
In American Notes’s chapter on slavery, he quotes from multiple American newspaper descriptions of escaped enslaved people loaded with iron rings, chains and weights – including a 12-year-old boy with a “chain dog-collar around his neck”.
In A Christmas Carol, Marley attributes his chain, made of “cash-boxes … ledgers … and heavy purses”, to his heartless pursuit of business profit in life. Marley warns Scrooge that he too is a “captive, bound and double-ironed”, suggesting that exploitation for money will ultimately fetter the exploiter as well as the exploited.
Two recent adaptations of A Christmas Carol have suggested that Scrooge and Marley’s business is at least partly built on the trade in enslaved people. Jon Clinch’s 2019 novel Marley makes the link direct, while Steven Knight’s television series of the same year implies it.
For example, Stephen Graham’s Marley tells Guy Pearce’s Scrooge: “Look at these chains Ebenezer … Each link is a man or woman or child who died in our workshops”, mentioning locations not only in “London, Birmingham, Manchester”, but also “Batavia … Mauritius, the Bay of Honduras”. Slavery was present in the last three locations until at least the 1830s.
While Dickens opposed slavery, he was far from immune to racism. Notoriously, his support for the brutal British colonial response to an uprising of Jamaican plantation workers in 1865 contrasted with his career-long advocacy against the deprivations of the British working classes.
In Zadie Smith’s historical novel The Fraud (2023), the character of Dickens suggests that Brits should be turning their attention from the compensation given by the British government to slave owners in the British Empire to problems closer to home. Such a portrayal is supported by Dickens’s mockery of Mrs Jellyby in Bleak House (1853) for her “telescopic philanthropy”, which centres on Africans in the fictional “Borrioboola-Gha” rather than the people in her immediate vicinity.
If Dickens did intend to use the final line of A Christmas Carol to support the anti-slavery cause in the American Civil War, this would allow us to rethink how he may have seen the relationship between exploitation and inhumanity at home and abroad. It suggests that, in at least some circumstances, he was able to see these causes in connection rather than competition.

It’s the last tournament of the season for the Missouri student program of The Bass Federation, and it’s also the final opportunity to earn enough points to be named Team of the Year — the top-scoring duo in the state.
“The tournament itself meant a lot to us, with it being our last state tournament together,” Karg said. “It was very tough. There was, at most, two inches of visibility in the water, but a lot of fishing is just adapting to the changes.”
Karg and Massa headed out on the water for two days for eight hours each. At the end of each day, they weighed their top five fish. 
“The first day, they caught almost enough bass to win the tournament,” said Gary Foree, Karg’s mentor and family friend, who is a former professional fisherman. “They had almost 19 pounds, which is insane. There hasn’t been a tournament in three years over 17 pounds on Truman Lake.”
They brought in 16 pounds on the second day, which would have brought their total up to nearly 35 pounds. But unfortunately it didn’t count. Their boat malfunctioned, making them miss the weigh in.  
“It was pretty heart-wrenching,” Karg said. “It was one of our best bags as a team on one of the most difficult days.”
But it wasn’t all lost. 
Karg and Massa ended up taking second place at Truman Lake with one day’s worth of fish, and they still had enough points to be named Team of the Year, just as they were last year.
Karg has been part of the Team of the Year five years in a row, including as an incoming high-school freshman. 
That title also sent the team to the TBF Student Angler Federation High School National Championship, which was held at Oklahoma’s Grand Lake O’ the Cherokees in June. 
Only the top two high-school teams from each state can compete, and Karg is the only person in Missouri to have qualified for that opportunity five years in a row, according to officials for the national championship.
“To be one of the top two teams in Missouri for five consecutive years is pretty freaking amazing,” said Karl Buck, who previously led the federation’s high school program in Missouri and was also Karg’s team leader. “I’m just so proud it’s unbelievable. I mean, I can’t believe that I was involved in his upcoming as a fisherman.”
Karg began competitive fishing when he was 12 and participated in dozens of individual and team tournaments as a teen. Through it all, he struggled with an autoimmune illness that made him miss numerous days from school, he said, but he’s proud he still managed to graduate on time in May and continue fishing.
While it was grueling standing on a boat for hours under the hot sun, Karg said the national championship was exhilarating because some of the world’s top fishermen were watching. 
“It’s the biggest tourn of the year, and a lot of people only get to go to it once, if even,” Karg said. “It really could be the biggest tournament of your life.”
 A promise

Karg has loved to fish ever since he could hold a rod, said his father Rick Karg. Even as early as 5, he said Karg could catch fish when the adults around him were coming up empty. 
“There’s a magic,” Rick said. “My scientific brain says, ‘Is there like a vibration from his heartbeat that travels down the line because he’s got his finger touching it, that the fish like?’” 
Foree met Karg because of a life-changing promise he made to Karg’s mother, Becky Rumley.
Rumley was the nurse administering Foree’s chemotherapy treatment at St. Claire Hospital, and one day, she told him how much her nine-year-old son loved to fish. At the time, Foree thought he only had a few months to live.
“I ended up telling her that if I survive this, I’ll take him to Lake of the Ozarks and get him a five pounder because I used to be a [fishing] guide on the lake,” he said.

Foree did pull through, and when they went out fishing, Karg didn’t just catch one five-pound bass. 
“I caught three five-pound bass and two six pounders, and like a bunch of big fish,” Karg said. “It is probably the best day of fishing in my life. And ever since then, he’s just dedicated a huge part of his life to help teach me and my partner.”
Foree was equally amazed after Karg pulled out nearly 40 pounds of fish that day. 
“He just had the best day of fishing anybody could have,” Foree said. “That’s how I got him hooked on fishing.”  
Over the years, Foree taught him about tracking fish through the different seasons and how to read the water and the banks. He also helped him get his first boat.
Now, Foree said, Karg’s instincts are his fishing superpower. 
“So many times they won a tournament when the fishing was really tough, and Luke said, ‘Let’s try over here. That bank looks good,’” Foree said. “And they’ll go over, and they’ll catch enough fish on that bank to win the tournament.”
Karg believes his instincts have developed with the dozens of tournaments and countless hours of fishing. 
“Over time, it’s become more of an instinct, than having to think about, ‘Oh, I should make a change,’” he said. “It just naturally comes.”
For instance, at both the Truman Lake and national championship, Karg said he was painting his own custom lures while he was on the boat.
At Truman, he made the decision to color a half-inch chartreuse line on his spinner bait, he said, and he ended up catching much bigger fish, but less fish. If his lure had a straight tail, the catch was better as well, he said.
“It’s all about how the bait works in the water,” he said. “The smallest little detail that can just trigger the fish to eat. That’s where a lot of the fun comes into it for me, is all the difficulties and fun little changes you can make. You can go from catching no fish for hours on end to catching your limit in a minute.”
 ‘Find five’

Karl Buck remembers meeting Karg when he was about 12 on a dock at the Peaceful Valley Lake in Owensville, where Karg’s grandparents have a lake house. Buck used to run a student program called the Owensville Anglers, and they were finishing up a tournament that day.
“When we were doing our weigh-in down at the dam, they came down to the boat ramp to inquire,” Buck said. “He’ll probably hate this, but he was the most bashful young man, super quiet and reserved.” 
The Owensville Anglers is how Karg got his start with tournament fishing, which Buck says is much different than regular fishing. 
In a tournament, Buck said the first rule is “find five.” 
“You’re fishing for five fish,” Buck said. “Doesn’t matter what they weigh, they just got to be keepers,” meaning they are big enough to keep.
Luke Karg, left, and A.J. Massa hold up their top three fish at the TBF Student Angler Federation High School National Championship, which was held at Oklahoma’s Grand Lake O’ the Cherokees in June (photo submitted).
The fish go in the box where they’re kept alive and healthy, which is a standard conservation practice in the high-school tournaments. 
“After you have five, then you’re going to change your game,” he said. “It’s now no longer about just catching fish. You’re looking to upgrade the fish that you already have. Big fish get big for a reason. They’re hard to catch.”
Big fish know how to hide, and that’s where casting skills come into play, Foree said. He called Karg’s casting skills “insane.” 
“He can skip jigs and lures and put them in places nobody else can,” Foree said. “That’s why he’s so good.”
But he wasn’t always that good, Buck remembers, which is why Karg earned the nickname “Oops” after fishing with Buck and his son one day.
“Luke throws this cast — I believe it was a spinner bait — and it winds up on the roof of this dock, stuck,” Buck said. “So we go up and we get it. A little while later, he makes another cast and it gets stuck on somebody’s dock.”
After each time, Karg would just say, “Oops” and the nickname was born. Buck said when they fished together this past summer, he was blown away at his talent. 
Karg and Massa ended up placing 56th out of more than 200 teams in the national championship in Oklahoma. 
“We lost three three-pounders that came off the boat,” Karg said after the tournament finished. “That would have gotten us up to nine or 10 pounds. We would have been around 12th place probably.”
Karg said he’s proud of his accomplishment over this high school career, and he couldn’t have done it without his fishing partners Massa and previously Kyle Kannawurf, along with their boat captains.
“No one gives credit enough to our boat captains, which were both of our dads,” he said, “just giving the time to drive all the way out there and standing with us out the boat for eight hours straight a day.”
As boat captain, Rick said he was in “constant amazement” at his son’s skill.
“I’d just sit there and watch and think, ‘How in the world are you doing this?’” Rick said. “You’re like a super sharp shooter.”
Rick said he’s watched Karg fish for seven hours without catching anything, but he’d still have the focus and creativity change his strategy and get a big catch at the last minute. Karg’s humility and attitude are among the most impressive things about him, said Foree and Buck, particularly his ability to bounce back from setbacks. 
“He never got rattled,” Foree said. “Oh, he’d get upset if he lost a big fish, but he’d just say, ‘Okay, I learned something from that,’ and go on to the next one. His ability to focus and stay focused in times of turmoil when he loses fish or the weather changes is very, very important in professional bass fishing.”
Karg has his own boat detail business, and there are several career paths he’s interested in taking, including a professional fisherman. 
“But for that, I would have to be away from home around 200 days of the year,” he said. “So the one I’m probably gonna go with is a natural environmentalist studying fresh water fish.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Luke-Karg-and-Gary-Foree1-scaled-e1766100704252-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-25 07:11:42.986944

A telecom company based in Springfield has donated $5,000 among 10 rural food pantries in Vermont this month.
“Supporting local food pantries has long been important to us,” said Andrea Spaans, marketing manager and wireless supervisor at the Vermont Telephone Company and VTel Wireless, via email. “This December, we wanted to do more and make sure our support reached as many local pantries as possible.”
The small, family-owned company operating since 1890, provides internet, phone and television services across 14 rural villages in Vermont, according to its website. While it has contributed to local food pantries since the 2010s, it increased its seasonal donation this year to spread the joy across some of the communities it serves, Spaans said.
The Grafton Community Church, which runs the local food pantry, is a first-time recipient.
“VTel’s effort is amazing. So unexpected,” Mary Howard Hall, outreach coordinator who received a $500 check earlier this month, said in an email. “Their donation will go toward feeding our neighbors.”
Christmas is a busy time for the church and food pantry, which is open 8:30 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday, and 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Sunday. Additional hours are available if needed.
“Some people have keys to let themselves in to get food when we are closed,” she said. “Isn’t that wonderful? We have never turned anyone away.”
When the Grafton Inn across the street closed its kitchen at the start of the pandemic in 2020, they called the church. 
“I took all their food, which was a lot, and it disappeared in two hours,” Hall said.
That’s how the pantry at the chapel began, and they have kept it going since. It now offers shelf-stable foods, sometimes eggs, cheese and meats, and produce from the Vermont Foodbank, which they partner with.
Separate from the church budget, the pantry runs on donations of both food and money and costs about $10,000 to $13,000 per year, according to Hall. The town of Grafton donates $1,000 each year, and they apply for grants. With rising prices, it’s a lot for a small rural church – but also a priority.
“Each year, of course, we spend more money, as prices continue to rise,” she said. So they were happy to receive an unexpected check.
They work with local farmers and growers, as well as with Grafton Cares, a community effort that provides two lunches and two dinners a month at the chapel building at 4 Main St. They also offer rides to medical appointments and help coordinate Meals on Wheels deliveries, Hall said.
VTel’s holiday donation this year includes the Black River Good Neighbor Services in Ludlow, Chester-Andover Family Center, Danby Town Office Food Bank, Hartland Community Food Shelf, Our Place Community Food Center in Rockingham, Pawlet Community Church Food Pantry, Springfield Family Center, Wallingford Town Hall Food Cupboard and Woodstock Community Food Shelf, according to the release.
“Local food pantries are often volunteer-led and deeply rooted in the communities we serve,” Spaans said in an email. “Supporting them is a tangible way for us to back the people and organizations doing that day-to-day work and help ensure they have the resources they need.”
The donation follows VTel’s annual tradition of serving a free Thanksgiving dinner for VTel customers over 65. This year, it served more than 800 meals at Black Rock Steakhouse in Springfield and The Barn Restaurant in Pawlet, according to a VTel press release.
The company will continue to give back locally through its Round Up for Change program, which allows customers to voluntarily round up their monthly bill to the nearest dollar. The proceeds, which vary yearly, are donated to a selected organization at the end of the year.  The 2026 recipient is Meals and Wheels of Greater Springfield, a volunteer-driven organization that delivers approximately 500 meals each week to residents who are unable to shop or cook for themselves, Spaans said. It also provides wellness checks and social connection.

(Photo by searagen/Getty Images)It’s Christmas time, and you’ve got the entire holiday package wrapped up in a big, red bow:

Glittering tree
Twinkling lights
Jingling bells
Festive wreaths
Dashing reindeer
Cheerful snowmen
Angelic tree-topper

All these iconic images combine to transport us to the holiday destination of our dreams. However, Santa’s reindeer-guided sleigh may be losing its luster. Today, an old red pickup truck is making inroads into Americans’ traditional mode of holiday transport: Picture a vintage red pickup truck emerging from the snowy evergreen woods with a freshly cut pine tree loaded into the truck bed, or fastened on top of the roof.
This commercially popular image is plastered on tree ornaments, hand towels, greeting cards, gift wrap, coffee cups, and more. You can buy miniature vintage red pickups, too. Or you can make your own from two small wooden crates, LED stick-on lights, hot glue, and of course, a coat of bright red paint.
Have you ever wondered how — and why — the image of this classic red pickup has become synonymous with Christmas? What’s the connection?
Rooted in history
This ubiquitous pickup, with pronounced fenders, running boards, and dual round headlights, was common in the post-war era through the early 1950s. Some identify it as a 1935 Ford Model 50, or a 1939 Chevrolet Half-Ton, or possibly a 1949 Dodge B1-C-116 or 1946 Dodge WC.
During that era, pickup trucks were owned by rural Americans, farmers, veterinarians, and trades folks. No one called them “essential workers.” Their trucks were tools of their trade, used hard, repaired often, but trusted to get the job done over the long haul.
Today, 47% of Americans, including urban folks from all walks of life, own and drive pickups. A quick survey of big box parking lots and urban freeways reveals rows of pickups. Many of the over-muscled models, think Dodge Ram 3500, are considered status symbols. However, their truck beds often are empty.
In 2021, three-fourths of Christmas trees in American homes were artificial. The red pickup with a pine tree loaded in the truck bed harkens back to the days when families brought home freshly cut Christmas trees. My kids loved climbing into our old pickup to head to Ho Ho Holt’s Christmas Tree Farm near Stratford, where they hitched a ride on a tractor-drawn hayrack to the back 40 to choose a tree. When the Holts closed their business, we made the trek to Deal’s Orchard near Jefferson, where their on-farm store offers all kinds of goodies, from Deal’s fresh apple cider, apples, candies, holiday decor, and more recently its own hard cider. “Fill your life with experiences, not things. Have stories to tell, not stuff to show.” –is the quote posted on its website.
When the original pickup truck rolled off the factory floor, most Americans lived in small towns or on farms. In 1940, 18% of Americans farmed. Only 25% had phones, and 33% had electricity. Many Americans shopped in hometown stores, or ordered from a Sears-Roebuck Wish Book catalog. The catalog featured toys, clothes, gadgets, bedspreads, Blue Willow China sets – and more! Even if your family couldn’t afford to buy much, the arrival of the catalog was an invitation to dream. Grandparents, parents, and children alike could wish for something bigger, brighter, and better in their everyday lives.
Hallmark movies, a perennial holiday favorite, often portray small towns as an escape vehicle for Americans. When the heroine leaves the big city and ends up in a quaint town, she discovers its subtle charms. Sometimes she returns to her hometown for the first time in years, and now sees it with a different set of eyes. She might even discover the love interest she left behind.
Holding onto the past
We live in an America where 86% of us live in urban and suburban places, 75% trim artificial trees, almost 1 in 3 has an Amazon Prime membership, and SUVs account for 52% of new vehicle sales. How does this red pickup truck trend fit in?
The rustic red pickup isn’t simply a mode of transportation. It invites us on an emotional journey. “Over the river and through the woods to Grandmother’s house we go” connects us to warm memories of home and family. Only 25% of Americans still live in their hometowns, and the image of a red pickup traveling a country road creates the possibility of a return trip to rediscover our roots. Or, it might suggest a search for something that tumbled unnoticed out of the truck bed of our earlier lives. Only years later, we’ve recognized our enduring loss.
The vintage red truck captures a longing for simplicity, practicality, or a slower and less complicated time when we felt more grounded.
Nostalgia is a coping mechanism. It serves as an emotional buffer in times of stress, chaos, sadness, and loss. As we approach our 250th anniversary as a country, Americans are struggling with high food costs, inflation, tariffs, international conflicts and violence at home, a widening gap between rich and poor, and a chief executive whose words and actions repudiate the values passed down by generations – including those who relied on those pickups as the workhorse vehicle for their road trip to the American dream.
Is it any wonder that now, more than ever, we may be choosing to remember only a small time capsule of our Americana fever dream?
For despite the economic boom following post-World War II, life wasn’t always made of the stuff of Hallmark movies on the farms, in the small towns, and large cities of America during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Scratch below the surface, and you’d find:
· An estimated 35% of Americans living below the poverty line
· A polio epidemic ravaging families and their children
· A draft of Americans to fight across the globe, this time in the Korean War
· A resurgent Ku Klux Klan in reaction to the Civil Rights movement
Emotional journey
Bruce Hanson isn’t nostalgic for old pickups — he has the real thing: a 1947 Dodge. Hanson, a college classmate, likes to say we are graduates of the Bea Tift School of English. A decade after that earning our college degrees, I found that Bruce was combining farming with a photography/writing business. He occasionally submitted humorous poetry to me at Successful Farming. Although I haven’t seen Bruce for decades, I’ve reconnected with him and his wife, Mary Kae, through Substack.
Bruce’s old truck isn’t red. (It’s hard to imagine a firetruck-red workhorse truck.) Years ago, he penned a poem and photographed his old truck as part of a freelance assignment about auctioneering. Bruce titled it, “Sellin’ Dreams.” More recently, Bruce collaborated with a friend who lives in Hawaii who set this poem to music, and recorded the song. Bruce added his video and photographs of the truck, and the project was produced locally.
I asked Bruce if he ever planned to sell his truck at an auction, and his response articulates the old red pick-up truck phenomenon better than I ever could. He wrote:
“I would never sell it. I learned to drive in that truck. Chased cows and built fence with that truck. I drove it to high school football practice. My three kids learned to drive it. My youngest son drove his bride away from the church on his wedding day in that old ‘47 Dodge.”
Thanks to Bruce for sharing this YouTube video.
I hope you enjoy his take on this emotional journey.
Hold fast to dreams
During the empty nest phase of our journey to Deal’s Orchard these days, my husband and I often look through the rear view mirror of our pickup with rose-colored glasses. “It’s OK to look back at the past. Just don’t stare,” I remind myself.
We also have the choice of looking through the front windshield at what’s ahead. Is it possible the vintage red pickup suggests an optimistic journey through a time portal to a New Year filled with possibilities? This commercially popular red truck sensation is, at its core, about selling a dream. It might be a dream of the past-– or possibly one for the future.
Maybe, just maybe, there’s a subliminal message driving the popularity of the red truck theme: the determination to keep going, persisting, and moving forward through life’s journey, even when it’s difficult or seemingly hopeless. Maybe it’s the simple message of resilience popularized by underground artist Robert Crumb in the late 1960s:
KEEP ON TRUCKIN’

FORT HALL RESERVATION, Idaho — Standing atop Ferry Butte, Frances Goli scanned the more than half a million acres of Shoshone-Bannock tribal land below as she dug her hands into the pockets of a pink pullover.
The April wind was chilly at one of the tribes’ highest vistas in remote southeastern Idaho.
“Our goal is to bring fiber out here,” Goli said, sweeping one hand across the horizon. The landscape below is scattered with homes, bordered in the east by snowcapped mountain peaks and to the west by “The Bottoms,” where tribal bison graze along the Snake River.

In between, on any given day, a cancer patient drives to the reservation’s casino to call doctors. A young mother asks one child not to play video games so another can do homework. Tribal field nurses update charts in paper notebooks at patients’ homes, then drive back to the clinic to pull up records, send orders, or check prescriptions.
Three years ago, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes were awarded more than $22 million during the first round of the federal Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program. But tribes that were awarded millions in a second round of funding saw their payments held up under the Trump administration. Last month, federal leaders announced modifications to tribal broadband programs as part of a larger effort to “reduce red tape.” The National Telecommunications and Information Administration said it plans to “promote flexibility” and launch a new grant in the spring.
Federal regulators declined to provide details. The announcement comes after a year of upheaval for federal broadband programs, including the elimination of Digital Equity Act funding, which President Donald Trump has called “racist,” and a restructured $42 billion Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment program, which U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said was influenced by “woke mandates.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Across Indian Country and on the Fort Hall Reservation, high-speed internet service gaps persist despite billions set aside for tribes. In early November, U.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) asked federal agency leaders why funds already awarded had not been released to tribes and whether federal regulators were providing adequate technical assistance.
So far, the $3 billion tribal program has announced $2.24 billion in awards for 275 projects nationwide. But tribes that won awards have drawn down only about $500 million, according to a recent update from the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General.
The agency has initiated tribal consultation on the broadband programs, offering tribal leaders two dates in January for online meetings.
The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes have drawn down less than 2% of their awarded funding and the program has not yet connected a single household, Goli said. NTIA spokesperson Stephen Yusko said the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes are still slated to get their full grant award and, he confirmed, future spending will not be subject to the administration’s recalibrations.
Gaps in high-speed internet can be profound and urgent on tribal lands. Tribal members are historically underserved and, on average, live with the highest rates of chronic illnesses and die 6.5 years earlier than the average U.S. resident.
Diabetes and high suicide rates are among the most pernicious tribal health challenges — and federal research confirms telehealth can improve health outcomes. A KFF Health News analysis showed that people tend to live sicker and die younger in America when they live in dead zones, or places where poor internet access intersects with shortages of health care providers, leaving patients who need it most unable to use telehealth.
“We’re in survival mode,” said Nancy Eschief Murillo, a longtime Shoshone-Bannock leader. The tribes, which have an on-site clinic, need more health care both in person and with telehealth, she said. “Right now, our reservation? We don’t have accessibility.”

 Fort Hall has about 2,400 households. Nearly all of them live without high-speed internet.

Inside a trailer that serves as the temporary headquarters for Fort Hall’s tribal broadband office, Goli sat at a desk in June and scanned the Federal Communications Commission’s most recent online map of the reservation.
As the tribes’ broadband project manager, Goli didn’t like what she saw on the map. Blue hexagons highlighted varying rates of high-speed coverage and signified that high-speed internet is available on much of the reservation. Companies have told federal regulators they provide fast transmission speeds to homes there.
“These are untrue,” Goli said. Fort Hall has about 2,400 households, and nearly all of them live without high-speed internet, she said.
When it comes to tracking who on a reservation has high-speed internet, “everybody acknowledges, including the FCC, that the map is not 100% accurate,” said Robert Griffin, co-chair of the Fiber Broadband Association Tribal Committee, an industry trade group. He is also the broadband director for the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.
Attempting to correct the maps is one of the many tasks Goli has taken on since becoming the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes’ broadband project manager in January 2023 — seven months after the tribes won the award.
A series of hurdles, including flaws in the plan initially approved by the federal government and a cyberattack, have delayed the project, she said. The attack hit in August 2024 and for months shut down nearly all phones and computers on the reservation.
“We didn’t have access to any of our information,” Goli told KFF Health News this month, adding that the tribes are still “in recovery mode” from the attack.
Goli, who grew up on the reservation and still plays basketball at the tribal gym, left her job as a data analyst in Seattle to return home to be with family and to work. For two years, and with no broadband industry experience, Goli has overseen the multimillion-dollar grant without a staff.
Her first task, she said, was to collect data that could help create a realistic plan to deliver broadband to every home on the reservation. “Data tells a story,” Goli said.

Fort Hall and many other tribal lands are remote with rugged, expansive terrain. To build fiber-optic cables underground, the tribes must navigate lava rock and work with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to get permits. To build communications towers, the tribes must ensure they follow migratory bird rules for American bald eagles. To provide wireless connections, the tribes must buy or license spectrum from federal regulators, Goli said.
When the federal tribal broadband program launched, more than 300 tribal applicants — pitching projects totaling $5 billion  — submitted requests to the NTIA. During a later round of funding, more than 160 tribal applicants asked for more than $2.6 billion, even though only $980 million was available. There are 574 federally recognized tribes in the United States.
The tribal program funding was not enough to “build out Indian Country,” said Joe Valandra, chief executive and chairman of the broadband consulting firm Tribal Ready. Valandra is a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota.
Congress created the tribal program to be used in combination with funds from the larger $42 billion Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment, or BEAD, program, Valandra said.
But now, it seems “the administration has no appetite for expensive broadband infrastructure builds in rural areas,” said Jessica Auer, a senior researcher with the community broadband networks team at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy nonprofit.

Auer, who has followed the implementation of tribal programs, said the administration may think the money already given to states for BEAD, as well as the use of satellite internet connections, will be enough for tribal lands.
“They seem to have a strong interest in declaring this problem solved,” she said. Low-earth-orbit satellites, though, are costly for the consumer and do not always offer the consistent high speeds they should, she said.
Goli’s plan does not include the use of satellites. On Fort Hall, the few households that have fast speeds now buy Starlink, but tribal leaders say the $80 to $120 monthly subscription costs are too expensive for most members.
The newly revised plan will use a hybrid of fiber-optic cables and wireless internet to ensure that people can “live their lives, whether it be health, education, telehealth,” Goli said.
 First fiber-optic lines will cover two-mile segment on northern end of reservation

Ladd Edmo, a councilman for the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, thinks the tribal broadband project is taking too long.
Goli “is doing the best she can,” Edmo said.

But when he thinks about the millions waiting to be spent, Edmo said, he worries federal regulators “can just grab it back.”
“I’m not afraid of the current administration,” said Edmo, who is in his fifth term on the tribes’ business council. “I just think that they’re looking for money everywhere they can.”
Edmo lives about half a mile from the Fort Hall townsite and said he can’t really use his internet because he “gets a tremendous amount of buffering.” When he travels to doctors for his prostate cancer treatment, Edmo has them print paper schedules to keep track of his treatment.
He said he is not a big fan of telehealth, “probably because I don’t know how to use it.”
 
For 53-year-old Carol Cervantes Osborne, who also lives on the reservation, having internet is a necessity. Osborne is in constant pain from severe rheumatoid arthritis.
“I’m just all broke down,” Osborne said as she stared at the open pasture last June. She talked about how she misses riding cattle roundups. At times, Osborne has been bed-bound because of her arthritis and bad knees. She said she tapped her credit line, which uses land and cattle as collateral, and signed up for Starlink so that she can connect with doctors remotely through telehealth appointments.
“I’m poor because of it, but we’ve got to have it,” Osborne said.

Meanwhile, nearly 15 months after the cyberattack, Goli said the tribes are beginning to hire vendors.
“Things happen very slow when it comes to processing things in the tribal government,” Goli said, adding there are a lot of “checks and balances.”
This month — as the holidays approached — Goli said she was excited.
“We’ve actually started our first segment of fiber,” Goli said. The engineering work is done, and they have begun issuing permits, she said. The fiber-optic lines, built by a private vendor, will cover a two-mile segment on the northern end of the reservation. The line will come from outside the reservation and connect to the tribes’ data hub, which is an old radio station still being converted into broadband offices.
“It’s our first segment, and we’re really using this as a test,” Goli said.
Eventually, the old radio station will be central to operations, with fiber-optic cable lines that web out over about 800 square miles to reach the reservation’s five district lodges. Each lodge will establish a communications tower, which will use the fiber line to power wireless antennas that will then provide high-speed internet to the reservation’s most remote homes.
Goli said the tribes are applying for another extension — and, she said, they would not be the only award winners of the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program to ask for more time. Working with tribes, she said, takes time.
“It really saddens me that we’ve been left behind all these years,” Goli said, but “this is our opportunity. We want to do it right, slow and steady.”
Sarah Jane Tribble, KFF Health News’ chief rural correspondent, spent more than a year interviewing Frances Goli through calls, texts, and emails. She traveled to Fort Hall Reservation twice, having received tribal approval to visit the land: in spring 2024 and again in summer 2025. Tribble also reviewed publicly requested copies of the tribal contract and interviewed dozens of industry and regulatory broadband experts.

An estimated more than 30,000 people turned out for a March 21 anti-Trump rally in Denver’s Civic Center Park, where U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, joined by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, denounced the administration as a “government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, for the billionaires.” It was the best-attended rally ever held by Sanders, a two-time presidential candidate, until another record-breaking crowd in Los Angeles in April.
Seven months later, Civic Center Park and the Capitol grounds were again swarmed by an estimated crowd numbering in the tens of thousands, during the largest of more than 50 No Kings protests held in Colorado on Oct. 18.

In the meantime, lawmakers at the Capitol had passed long list of bills to contain the federal fallout, including protections for transgender people and gender-affirming care, a landmark state voting rights law, and much more.
Below is a selection of Colorado Newsline’s most-read and most-shared news stories of 2025.
Capacity crowds turn out in Colorado for Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez
Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez drew large crowds at stops in Greeley and Denver, where they made the case that a fight against a billionaire “oligarchy” should be the focal point of the party’s resistance to the second Trump administration.
“In the hundreds of rallies that I have done, we have never, ever had a rally as large as this,” Sanders said during a rally in Civic Center Park. “And Denver, your presence here today is not just significant for Colorado. You are sending a profound message all over the world. The whole world is watching, and they want to know if the people of America are going to stand up to Trumpism, oligarchy and authoritarianism.”
Colorado Senate committee advances bill to ban guns that accept detachable magazines
A law passed by the Colorado Legislature this year banned the sale of semiautomatic firearms that can take detachable magazines. Sponsors framed Senate Bill 25-3 as an effort to enforce the intent of Colorado’s existing large-capacity magazine law from 2013, which limits magazines to 15 rounds of ammunition. Gunmen in two recent Colorado shootings — in 2021 at a Boulder King Soopers and in 2023 at a nightclub in Colorado Springs — used magazines banned under that law.
Colorado House approves pair of bills for transgender health care and protections
With transgender rights on shaky ground at the federal level under the Trump administration, Colorado lawmakers this year approved two bills to strengthen protections for transgender people and gender-affirming care. House Bill 25-1309 codified into state law existing state public health rules about gender-affirming health care coverage, while House Bill 25-1312 added protections for transgender people in schools and courts.

In May, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the Colorado Voting Rights Act, establishing various protections contained in the federal Voting Rights Act at the state level. 
Senate Bill 25-1, the first bill of the 2025 legislative session, prohibits election practices that limit the participation of people of color and other protected groups. It also includes protections for LGBTQ+ voters, expands multilingual ballot access, and requires accommodations for people with disabilities at residential facilities. The state attorney general can enforce voting rights under the Colorado measure, so the state does not need to rely on federal courts to enforce voting protections.
​Trump signs formal pardon for Tina Peters, lawyer claims it applies to state charges
This month, President Donald Trump said that he had signed a formal presidential pardon for Tina Peters, the former Mesa County clerk convicted of her role in a breach of her office’s secure elections systems, part of an attempt to uncover evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election.
Trump does not have the power to pardon Peters, who was convicted on state charges. But her lawyer, Peter Ticktin, lobbied Trump for the pardon after developing an unsupported theory that the presidential pardon power does in fact apply at the state level, expressing hope that the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority will rewrite the centuries-old legal principle of dual sovereignty in criminal proceedings.
In shift, Sen. Bennet supports Colorado constitutional amendment for emergency redistricting
Earlier this month, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat who is running for Colorado governor in 2026, announced he would support a constitutional amendment to allow the state to redraw its congressional districts to offset partisan gerrymandering in other states.
Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat who is also running for governor in 2026, was the first statewide elected official in Colorado to support the idea of redrawing the state’s congressional districts mid-cycle. Redistricting efforts by Democrats come in response to Trump’s successful pressure on Republican-led states, including Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio, to redraw their congressional lines so the party can pick up more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Protest against Trump brings about 8,000 people to Colorado Capitol

In April, about 8,000 people rallied and marched at the Colorado Capitol in Denver for one of the many volunteer-organized Hands Off! protests against the Trump administration. Addressing the crowd, Weiser told the crowd that the Trump administration “didn’t get the memo that immigrants make America great,” which is why he joined a lawsuit challenging Trump’s “unimaginable step of thinking a Sharpie could overrule the Constitution” when he issued an executive order to end birthright citizenship.
“In America, when we stand together, when we stand on our principles, we will always prevail,” Weiser said. “We cannot be silenced.”
U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans misrepresented family’s immigration history
Colorado Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican, has leaned heavily on the story of his Mexican-American grandfather, who he said immigrated the “right way” and “legal way,” to defend the extreme mass-deportation policies being pursued by the Trump administration.
But Evans mischaracterized the story of how his Depression-era ancestors achieved the American dream, and misstated key dates and details in his grandfather’s biography, according to documents obtained by Newsline. Those records show that his grandfather, Cuauhtemoc Chavez was squarely on the wrong side of the “strong immigration policies” Evans now invokes his name to champion.
Tens of thousands of Coloradans rally and march against Trump at No Kings protests
The largest anti-Trump protest of the year took place in October, when thousands of people gathered in opposition to Trump’s administration at a No Kings rally and march in Denver, one of more than 50 No Kings protests held across Colorado amid rising tensions over the country’s direction in his second term. On the state Capitol steps, the crowd heard from a lineup of speakers including former state Rep. Joe Salazar, who said in a fiery speech that Trump’s agenda “threatens to tear the fabric of this country apart.”
“There is no king in America, and we will not be silenced by authoritarians,” Salazar said to cheers.
Michael Bennet upends race with Colorado governor bid
Flanked by many of the state’s most prominent elected Democrats, Bennet announced his run for governor in an event in Denver’s City Park in April. His decision upended a race that had been expected to be a wide-open contest between multiple up-and-coming Colorado Democrats.
“Everything we care about now is at stake in our country,” Bennet said in a short announcement speech. “Business as usual is simply not enough, and that’s why I’m running for governor of Colorado.”

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — Mike Lamp may not be very busy as the cooling November temperatures settle on his apiary in Monongalia County, but that doesn’t mean the work stops entirely.
Serving as the president of both the West Virginia Beekeeper’s Association and the Monongalia County Beekeeper’s Association, Lamp and several other beekeepers throughout the state are working together to shore up protections for apiarists across the state.
Next year’s West Virginia legislative session will see a bill drafted by those beekeepers to protect the rights of beekeepers and encourage growth in the industry. The bill would create uniformity for beekeeping laws across the state, set aside funds to increase flora growth and pollination, and prepare for an incoming mite that threatens the bee population by making information about it clearer and available.

West Virginia saw an estimated 40% decline in the honey bee population from 2024 to 2025, according to the West Virginia Department of Agriculture. State Apiarist Shanda King said losses as high as 62% have been reported nationwide.
West Virginia Del. Daniel Linville, R-Cabell, said the bee decline can be attributed to a variety of factors, including harsh winters and an invasive species of mite.
The varroa mite came to the U.S. from Asia and transmits diseases throughout honey bee colonies. If enough bees in one colony die off before winter, no new worker bees can be produced and the remaining ones cannot effectively keep the queen bee warm by shivering around her, resulting in the whole colony dying off.


Bee mortality can make it harder for farmers to produce food because there are not as many pollinators.
“When you have a healthy population of pollinators of all kinds, that is tremendous for agriculture, for farmers, for all these things,” Linville said. “The more pollinators you have, the better as it relates to all types of farming, and obviously if you have fewer, then it’s a lot more difficult to produce the amount of that fruit or vegetable that you’d like.”
This upcoming bill, dubbed “The Bee Bill,” aims to fight the decline by increasing beekeeper protections in West Virginia.

The bill’s sponsors say the state’s beekeepers are dealing with an inconsistent regulatory environment — some local governments are more neutral toward beekeeping, while others outright criminalize it.
If passed, this bill would prevent some local bans on beekeeping, eliminate unnecessary licensing, strengthen legal protections for beekeepers and raise the legal standards for nuisance complaints, according to Eryck Stamper, a beekeeper and one of the drafters of the bill. The idea is to create more uniformity around beekeeping laws within the state and leave beekeeping regulation up to the WVDA as opposed to local governments.
“The goal is to have the state, which is doing a really good job as it already is, managing the bee population and program here in West Virginia,” Stamper said.
According to Lamp, the main goal is to protect beekeepers.
“No matter where they are, they can register their bees and be safe knowing that… as long as they’re abiding by the Department of Agriculture’s standards, of course, that they don’t have to worry about being fined or going to jail or anything crazy for being beekeepers and supporting our agriculture,” he said.

In addition to creating more consistent laws, the bill will also earmark funds from the Protect Pollinator special license plates to go to the State Road Fund and be used by the West Virginia Department of Highways to create pollinator plots by planting and maintaining flora along state highways.
Finally, the bill will also help prepare for an oncoming mite similar to the varroa mite. The tropilaelaps, or “tropi” mites, have not come to the U.S. yet, but are expected to be as devastating to the population as the varroa mite. According to King, both the tropi and varroa mites can spread disease throughout honey bee colonies, but the tropi mite reproduces at a much faster rate and is much harder to detect.
Where a varroa infestation might be manageable if caught early on, the tropi mite “can destroy a hive in weeks,” according to Jim Smith, another beekeeper supporting the bill.
The bill would define language around the newly emerging species and educate others about it.
“We know that tropilaelaps mites are gonna be here soon,” Lamp said. “It is just a matter of time before it gets here, like varroa mites got here, like everything else does. This is just a proactive step.”
According to Linville, some things everyday people can do to help support the state’s bee population are grow pollinator friendly plants like goldenrod and dandelions, know the difference between pollen-producing plants and nectar-producing plants, which bees need to produce honey, and grow a garden or even take up beekeeping themselves.
“Hopefully, if this bill makes it across the finish line, you can start keeping bees yourself,” Linville said. “It’s not an incredibly expensive thing to do, also it’s not a crazy time commitment.”
The West Virginia Beekeepers Association also encourages people to reach out to their local representatives about the bill to try and get it passed.
“We really want folks to reach out on our behalf because there are about 2,000 of us in this state of 1.8 million people, and as much as that doesn’t sound like a big number we touch a lot of folks,” Lamp said. “We support our communities and our cities and our counties and our state as a whole and we want them to support us too.”

The drafters of this bill are overall hopeful and do not expect much pushback for it, but understand that people may want laws like this to be left up to the local level, according to Lamp.
“There will be work to do beginning in January, but we’re hopeful that this can be one of those roughly 10% of introduced bills that can make it across the finish line,” Linville said.
West Virginia’s 2026 legislative session begins on Jan. 14, 2026 and lasts until March 14.

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)During the holidays, we’re bringing back our journalists’ favorite stories of 2025. This one is from October.
Christine Zhu: “As a Chinese American whose parents are immigrants, Asian grocers like H Mart were a substantial part of my life growing up — and they still are today. I’m proud that I was able to amplify coverage of Asian American communities during the current political climate in a meaningful way.”
Robert Cerniglia, a Korean American who’s lived in North Carolina for all his life, recalls the late 2016 opening of H Mart in Cary as monumental for members of his community.
It’s where he shops for snacks and other food items that aren’t readily available in other places. It’s the only H Mart in North Carolina, and shoppers flock to it from all over the state.
But in recent years, prices have been going up.
“A lot of the stuff that I normally buy has just increased in price,” Cerniglia said. “This is definitely something we’ve noticed a lot since the pandemic. The pandemic was really the highest price increase that we’ve seen, but it’s not really getting better.”
Representatives for H Mart did not respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.

“Everything has continued to be more expensive,” said Matthew Laurentz, another H Mart shopper. “Inflation has continued to drive things up.”
The current political climate hasn’t helped with that.
Since taking office in January 2025, President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on many international exports, including those from South Korea.
The country was the sixth-largest U.S. goods trading partner in 2024, with bilateral trade in goods totaling $200 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service. 
In July, Trump announced a 25% tariff on goods made in South Korea. He later lowered the rate to 15%, including for South Korean cars.
Officials representing the two nations have recently made “meaningful progress” in negotiations over $350 billion of investments in the U.S. that Seoul had earlier pledged in a deal to reduce tariffs, according to Reuters. But in the meantime, consumers are paying the price.
Vehicles and electronics comprise South Korea’s top exports to the U.S. by value. These include vehicle manufacturers like Hyundai and Kia, and electronic brands like Samsung and LG.
Prices have increased across the board since implementing more tariffs, but Ira Gabriel, senior group manager for corporate and marketing PR at Hyundai Motor America, stopped short of blaming the tariffs for the higher prices. 
Gabriel said pricing adjustments are influenced by a number of factors, including market dynamics, consumer demand, and upgrades to vehicle features as part of the annual model year changeover. 
“We will continue to respond to shifts in supply and demand with a flexible pricing strategy, targeted incentive programs, and a commitment to adding value for our customers,” Gabriel told NC Newsline in an email.
More than just cars and computers
Over the past few years, Korean cosmetic products — K-beauty for short — have skyrocketed  in popularity among younger Americans. South Korea shipped more skincare and cosmetics to the U.S. than any other country last year, AP News reported.

Korean snacks and media are also attracting more mainstream attention. Netflix’s KPop Demon Hunters is returning to theaters for Halloween, and Buldak ramen and other Asian foods have gone viral on TikTok. 
But even as the cultural bond between the U.S. and South Korea grows stronger, their geopolitical relationship has become more strained. 
Tensions between the two countries rose last month when more than 300 South Korean workers were detained after an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.
Following negotiations, the South Korean government chartered a flight for them to return home. 
The company said in a statement on its website that the safety and well-being of its workers is a top priority. 
“Hyundai works closely with HR and legal teams to ensure compliance with immigration and visa regulations,” Gabriel wrote in an email.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4179-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-25 06:12:07.113179

(Photo courtesy of Chad Elliott)The first time I portrayed Santa Claus was for my older sister’s kindergarten classroom. I was 19 years old, 6’2” and 180 pounds and I could not yet grow facial hair. Not a very convincing St. Nick.
I vaguely remember my sister warning me that I would have to park at a certain spot near the school as it was a very small community school which had a 180-degree window view on ground level around the classroom she was in. So in order to surprise the children, it would be paramount not to be seen.
I drove through the icy winter morning in my beat-up old 1985 Toyota Tercel, scraping the interior of my windshield as the defrost was not very efficient in the frigid temperatures. It didn’t help that I was putting off a lot of condensation beneath the pearly nylon beard and wig. It made me feel claustrophobic and anxious knowing that I would be representing Christmas for about 50 children for the rest of their lives. I kept asking myself, what I was thinking by agreeing to do this? That is a lot of pressure for a 19-year-old college kid.
Nonetheless, I barreled down the small, country highway which led to the town of Minden, Iowa. I waved at passing cars, laughing nervously to myself as families did double takes down the highway. I imagined parents explaining away the image of Santa sputtering down the road in a light blue and slightly rusted Japanese economy car to their young ones about how his sleigh must have broken down.
I roared up to the school and immediately regretted my parking situation. But I was also running late with no time to waste moving to a new space. So I wandered up the open lot which led to the door of the classroom. I could already hear the shrieks and shrill screams, “Santa! Santa!”
I did my lowest, “Ho, Ho, Ho,” and suddenly realized that I should’ve done more preparation. I had done improv acting and spent plenty of time in the theater growing up, but this role was different. There are certain protocols. Memories are being made and if I forgot to say certain things in a certain way, I could ruin Christmas for these kindergarteners!
For those of you who have not portrayed Kris Kringle, I am going to let you in on a little secret. It is all about capturing the persona. But also, perhaps even more importantly, you must have a firm grip. Imagine strangers handing off their most precious gift they have ever received in life while it is wriggling and screaming not wanting to be with you at all! All the while, your grip is impeded by cotton gloves but you can NOT drop them. You must be calm, jolly and answer strange questions about your fictional life in a faraway land. In short, you must lie — lie right through your teeth, and through that cheap, general store, nylon beard. The more fanciful the lie, the better, as to make sure the character you are creating has mystique and depth.
Of course, the usual dialogue then occurs, “Have you been a good boy/girl? What would you like me to bring you for Christmas?” You sometimes get some very original answers, but not always — not even often. You must act genuinely surprised when the children after the first in line asks for the exact same thing as the kid before them. It happened this day in my sister’s classroom. Every child wanted a toy tractor. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
I eventually got pretty comfortable during my first time portraying the iconic figure. I unloaded prepackaged gifts for each of them and thoroughly enjoyed our 30 minutes together. I acted as jolly as I could muster, but then I decided it was time to go. I would quit while I was ahead.
I stepped out onto the icy pavement, still in character waving at the children in the windows. Their little red faces were pressed up to the glass lining the building like ornaments bobbing up and down, still giddy with excitement to have met a celebrity of such caliber.
I kept walking, every once in awhile turning around to wave at them some more. I had pulled it off! I felt a sense of pride to have not completely botched it up for those kids’ sake and my sister’s sake.
The ice crunched beneath my snow boots as I got closer and closer to the car. My car! The kids could still see me! They would know I was an imposter! A few would most certainly begin to doubt if Santa Claus even existed!
My mind raced. “Should I turn around once more? Do I just keep walking down the street?” I had to decide quickly.
I got to my driver’s door and stopped for a second. I took a deep breath and turned around hoping that class had resumed. But as I turned, my fears were confirmed. There they were — the little elves were all lined up and waving at me just as thrilled as when I stepped into the classroom.
I then did the only thing I could think to do at 19 years old, dressed as Santa in Minden, Iowa. I threw my hands up into the biggest shrug like a silent movie actor and waved a really big “around-the-world” wave as if to say, “I’m outta here!” My boots squeaked as I wheeled about, opened the creaky, driver’s door and after three attempts to start the engine I finally sputtered away waving out the window. While all this was happening I kept muttering under my breath, “This cannot be happening … This cannot be happening …”
I think I even saw a few of the kids cock their heads like perplexed puppies in the window.
I pulled the car over when I reached the edge of town, far from the gaze of kindergarteners. I sat silent in the car trying to take in just how quickly things turned around for me back at the school. One minute I was Father Christmas, bringer of all good things, the next I was just a teenage art major posing for his sister’s class.
The squeak of my heel was still playing over and over in my mind. What had just happened? I comforted myself with the knowledge that my much more experienced sister would come up with the perfect excuse as to why Santa drove away in a rust bucket, blue Toyota.
It was then that it happened. I laughed the biggest, most jolly belly laugh I had ever laughed. A laugh to make Santa proud.
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!

The light display turns 90 this year, according to research by the State Archives. (Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)For 90 years, the North Dakota Capitol’s window-lit Christmas tree has been an annual holiday staple.
The Christmas tree design in the Capitol windows first appeared in 1935, said Sarah Walker, head of reference services for the State Historical Society of North Dakota, who has researched the display.
Construction on North Dakota’s Capitol was completed in 1934, replacing the Capitol building that was destroyed by fire in 1930. Walker’s research from newspaper stories showed that architects and the superintendent of the Capitol Commission discussed using the tower to display designs. 
The first Capitol lighting display was in 1934 as construction on the building was wrapping up, Walker said. It depicted a cross in the windows to commemorate Easter.
Later that year, the star of Bethlehem, containing 120 lights and measuring about 16 feet in diameter, was the first Christmas decoration for the building, although it was affixed to the top of the building and not displayed in the windows, she said.
Walker said it’s unclear from her research if the Christmas tree was red and green when the display first appeared in 1935. But she found a 1936 Bismarck Tribune article that described a red and green pattern.

“It’s such a cool tradition, and it’s so cool to think about how long it’s been going on,” Walker said. “I have not heard of this anywhere else.”
Other window-lit designs were also showcased during the early years of the building to celebrate a Kiwanis Club convention, the National Anti-Tuberculosis Association, a Christian ecumenical group and a dance held at the Capitol in conjunction with the legislative session, she said.
“It was meant to be used as a tool to welcome people and celebrate holidays,” Walker said. “I kind of think they were trying to be as inventive as possible and just created this really cool tradition.”
The red and green tree design has been consistent for decades, Walker said. A 1962 photo from the State Historical Society of North Dakota shows it similar to today.
Eighty-eight colored plastic window shades, 48 green and 40 red, on select windows on the north and south sides of the Capitol create the state’s iconic Christmas symbol, said Brandon Solberg, facilities director for the Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the Capitol grounds. 
It takes five members of the facilities department to install the window shades every year after Thanksgiving, Solberg said. After that, the custodial staff need to ensure the colored shades are pulled down each night on the appropriate windows. The remaining windows are shaded to create a darkened outline for the tree.
“You can see the Capitol tower from so many different angles, and from so far away, that to have it lit up for the holidays is just great,” Solberg said. “It’s quite a process to do that on every floor, every night.”

The Capitol also lights its windows to display the new year on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. The windows are also lit to display 4th on the Fourth of July. 
“Some offices aren’t very bright so they have to bring in lamps to kind of brighten up the room, so it can get kind of complicated,” he said. 
The building was illuminated with “ND 125” on Aug. 16, 2014, to celebrate North Dakota’s 125th birthday. In recent years, the Capitol has lit a single number in its windows to commemorate the football championships won by the North Dakota State University Bison, he said. 
The facilities department receives many requests to do other designs, in other colors, for special events, Solberg said, but the department typically turns down those requests because it would take too much time to set up and coordinate.
With the installation of new windows at the Capitol in 2026, Solberg said the architect was made aware of the annual window lighting to ensure the tradition continues.
He also said they are exploring the possibility of installing LED lighting in certain offices with automatic window shades that could make the lighting easier in the future, but those additions would require funding from the Legislature.
Walker, who is from Bismarck, recalls looking for the Capitol Christmas display as a little girl.
“I can remember just always looking for it to be up,” she said. “I really do kind of feel a sense of, ‘this is home.’”

Dec. 18, 2025 (Ian Karbal/Capital-Star)The Christmas season seems to start earlier and earlier each year. 
Some retailers start selling decorations around Halloween, while radio stations switch over to an all Christmas music format well before Thanksgiving
But for Brandon Mytrysak Christmas is a year-round focus. He’s the owner of Mytrysak Family Tree Farm and Growhouse in Indiana County, which sold around 1,000 Christmas trees this year. The day after Thanksgiving is when they open their doors for people looking for the perfect tree, tours and family activities. Then right before the holiday, the doors close. 
For Brandon, his wife Stacey Mytrysak, and even their three young daughters, there’s little downtime before that’s the months-long preparation for the next year’s rush begins.
“People don’t realize that this business here is an all-year thing,” Brandon Mytrysak said. “We’re constantly cleaning up, or getting ready for planting season, or repairing everything that broke during our tree season, mowing, shearing, and all that … In this business, basically we have to make all of our money in about a month to continue on to the next season.”
Despite the challenges — Brandon also works another full time job and Stacey works part time — a lot of the appeal is the joy they bring to others around the holiday season. But it also connects them to both their family’s and community’s histories.

The Christmas Tree Capital of the World
Signs welcome visitors entering Indiana County to the Christmas Tree Capital of the World. More than two dozen retail and wholesale farms grow Frasier Firs, White Pines, Colorado Spruces, Canaan Firs, Douglas Firs and more for the holiday. 
While it’s no longer true, if it ever was, that Indiana County farmers sell more Christmas trees than anywhere else in the world, the Mytrysak family has been part of the tradition for around 75 years, since the nickname first appeared.
According to the Indiana County Christmas Tree Growers Association, the industry began in the area around 1918. In 1956, an estimated 700,000 trees were harvested in the county. That’s around when the Associated Press referred to Indiana County as the “Christmas Tree Capital of the World.”

In 1958, a challenger emerged. The community of Shelton, Washington, attempted to claim the title for itself. But an Indiana County nursery operator put an end to the effort when he revealed he’d received an order of 15,000 trees to Tacoma, Washington. Another town in the Pacific Northwest – Estacada, Oregon – has also made similar claims recently.
According to the Pennsylvania Christmas Tree Growers Association, the state currently ranks second in the nation for the number of Christmas tree farms and fourth in number of Christmas trees cut each year.
Despite the dwindling number of Christmas Trees sold and growers in Indiana County, the name has stuck. And for a county already steeped in Christmas traditions, it’s been a label they carry with pride.
Indiana Borough, the county seat, is the hometown of Jimmy Stewart, the star of the holiday season staple “It’s A Wonderful Life.” The film made the community a minor tourist destination for Christmas fanatics across the country. There’s a Jimmy Stewart statue and museum, an “It’s a Wonderful Life festival,” and theaters that play the film in December. The main street, Philadelphia Street, is illuminated with Christmas lights for the holidays — some spelling out catchphrases associated with Stewart.
Bus tours full of Christmas tourists stop at the Mytrysak’s farm as well.
“Since we’re the Christmas Tree Capital, people love to just hear about the trees — how they grow, what we do,” Stacey Mytrysak said. “A lot of people think, ‘You plant that tree, next year it’s going to look like a Christmas tree.’ No, no, no. We have to shape them every year and fertilize and everything else. If not, they wouldn’t have that Christmas shape.”
A tree can take between six years and several decades to grow, depending on the size.
On top of working the farm, Stacey Mytrysak runs a gift shop and runs wreath-making classes. She and Brandon have also filled the property with family activities for the holiday season.  There are photo stations, tractor wagons, a small train, a fire pit for chilly nights, and a winery often sets up a booth during the pre-holiday season.

‘Keeping their memory alive’
Brandon is a third-generation tree farmer. His grandparents first began in the business in the late 1950s, roughly the time the county was labeled as the Christmas Tree Capital of the World.
When he was young, Mytrysak would work the fields with his grandparents and uncle. He helps Brandon and Stacey on the farm.
“I always enjoyed doing it,” Brandon said. “Ever since I can remember, I would be on the four-wheeler with my grandpap, helping him sell trees and talk with people. And in the summer time, he’d be shearing the smaller trees, and I’d be doing the little ones with my hand clippers, and all that stuff.”
“Doing it just kind of is my way of keeping their memory alive,” he added. “And hopefully I’m showing my kids the way, how we do it. Whenever we’re out here, I sit there and say ‘When I was your age, I’d be out here with my grandparents.’”
But Brandon’s grandparents have both since passed away, and the original family farm, a 10 acre plot, was handed down to his uncle, who still runs it.
In 2019, Brandon and Stacey bought the roughly 60 acre plot of land where they work now. Brandon said that’s when his wife got especially involved in the work.
“I could go up in the fields and just shear them all day. That wouldn’t bother me,” Stacey Mytrysak said. “With my kids, I’m able to put them off to school, come out here and work, go pick them up again. That’s what makes it nice, me being able to come out and work here on my own hours.”
Still, it can be a seven-day work week. But, they understand the demands and embrace them. Brandon works full time teaching landscaping to inmates. Stacey is a part time police officer in Windber Borough, Somerset County, and teaches swim lessons at the YMCA.
They also take pride in participating in community events, like hosting the Thanksgiving Day Turkey Trot to raise funds for the YMCA, or the Christmas in July festival. And each year, they donate trees to military bases around the country through the Trees for Troops program.

“I wish my grandparents were around just to see how we’ve progressed and how good of things we’re doing, not only in the Christmas tree world, but in the community as well,” Brandon Mytrysak said.
In the long run, Brandon and Stacey say their goal is to pay off as much debt on the farm as they can, and get it to be self-sustaining. That way they can give their daughters the option to continue the family tradition when they get older.
They say their older daughters, 8 and 10, are starting to show an affinity for the work, and spending time on the farm.
“They’re doing the same thing that I used to do when I was little,” Brandon Mytrysak said. “My father would dig the holes and I would try to go behind and shove the trees in the holes. Then my dad and uncle would come behind and kick them in.”
Stacey said it’s getting to the point where her kids get upset if they don’t go to the farm for the day, and have told her “‘Mom, you can never get rid of the farm.’”
“I’m okay if they turn it into something else, but I’d like to keep them something farm-wise” she said. “I like horses so I always joke and say, ‘It’s okay if you get horses. My husband gets mad when I say that.”
On Christmas itself, the family typically goes to either Brandon’s mom’s or Stacey’s parents’ house, where presents are waiting under a tree, from Indiana County, of course.
“That’s usually where we try to catch our breath, so to speak, and enjoy our kids and our families,” Brandon Mytrysak said. “Then it’s out here [to the farm], and away we go.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/img_8647_720.png,,,2025-12-25 05:57:07.626755

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)The controversial proposed Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center has cleared its final major regulatory hurdle, winning approval from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. 
In a letter dated Dec. 19, DEQ officials gave the green light for the 944-megawatt peaker plant to operate in Chesterfield near the Dutch Gap conservation area south of Richmond.
Dominion Energy has argued that the plant is needed to meet energy demand on the hottest and coldest days of the year. The new plant is slated to run about 30% of the time and will be able to be fired up in just minutes. It is set to be built on the site of a former coal fired plant that was retired in 2018 after operating for 70 years. Two gas turbines currently remain in operation at the site, providing about 400 megawatts of electricity. 
“This project will provide reliable power for hundreds of thousands of homes, businesses, schools and hospitals in Chesterfield and beyond. As part of our all-of-the-above energy strategy, it will ensure our region has the reliable power we need to continue growing and thriving,” Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said.
Fenceline communities near the project have been rallying against it for years. They argue that air monitors inside the towers and in the surrounding region do not fully capture the pollution the plant will emit. While emissions would be significantly lower than those from the previous coal plant, advocates said residents living nearby should not be subjected to them at all.
“We are profoundly disappointed that DEQ is siding with corporate polluters and ignoring the health impacts of air pollution from this dirty methane-fired power plant on our community,” said Glen Besa, chair of Friends of Chesterfield. 
The State Corporation Commission approved the project in November and also allowed the company to recover $1.47 billion from ratepayers to cover construction costs. The project is expected to come online in 2029 if construction begins in 2026, as Dominion hopes.
The Southern Environmental Law Center recently filed a petition on behalf of Appalachian Voices, Chesterfield NAACP, and Mothers Out Front challenging the final order, prompting the SCC to put that order on hold while it reviews the merits of the case. The petition argues that the project does not comply with the Virginia Clean Economy Act or the standards outlined in the Virginia Environmental Justice Act.
“We hope that the commission will see and acknowledge the unfairness of continuing to force particular communities to bear the brunt of pollution from fossil fuel infrastructure,” said SELC Senior Attorney Grayson Holmes. “Since this is the first case assessing what constitutes a ‘threat to reliability,’ sufficient to overcome the Clean Economy Act’s presumption against building new gas plants, we also hope the Commission will recognize that permitting Dominion to claim this narrow exception on flimsy evidence sets a bad precedent.”
Dominion has said the project is critical to maintaining grid reliability. It would be the first of six gas plants the company has said in its integrated resource plan will be needed to meet rapidly growing demand, largely driven by energy-hungry data centers across the state.
“We stand behind the SCC’s approval of the project. It was approved after a year of exhaustive review, an extensive public hearing and participation by thousands of Virginians,” Slayton said.
The petition is now under review by the SCC, and it could be weeks or months before the appeal is resolved, depending on whether the commission requests additional briefing.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — Leaves crunch under Kasia Bradley’s boots as she walks through the woods on Kentucky State University’s campus, listening for another sound — the knocking of a woodpecker against a tree. 
“You hear it?” Bradley said, noting the volume of the knocking. “It’s probably red-bellied.” 
She thought she had heard the call of a red-bellied woodpecker earlier that December afternoon, and she’s seen the bird on both sides of campus. “That’s just an ear over time that I’m like, ‘Oh, can I distinguish what bird that is?’ Bradley said.

Bradley, an extension associate for forestry and natural resources at the university, has been spending a lot of time in these woods this year because of the woodpeckers, or what she calls “ecosystem engineers.” The holes woodpeckers create to build nests are sometimes reused by songbirds like chickadees or bluebirds, creating habitat for other species. 
Supported by a grant from the National Wildlife Federation that promotes conservation of vulnerable species on university campuses, Bradley and her extension colleagues alongside community volunteers have been working to slowly reshape the woods along the Thorobred Trail into a place that better supports native birds. 
That especially includes the red-headed woodpecker — a different species within the same genus as the red-bellied. Both of them are part of the seven woodpeckers that call Kentucky home. 
While the red-bellied woodpecker has orange-red feathers on top of its head, the red-headed woodpecker’s head is entirely crimson — a “striking redhead,” Bradley said. The red-headed woodpecker is also called a “flying checkerboard” due to its vivid red, white and black coloring. 
“This bird’s a beautiful bird. It’s probably one of the most favorite woodpeckers in my opinion,” she said of the red-headed woodpecker.

It’s also a bird that has steadily and steeply declined in population, losing approximately 54% of its population from 1966 to 2019, according to data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. While not listed as threatened or endangered by wildlife authorities, in part because of its large range across North America, that steep population decline has made it a species of concern in some U.S. states like Wisconsin. 
Habitat loss is one of the reasons cited for the red-head’s decline, a significant factor in why bird populations across North America in general have declined by the billions since the 1970s. 
“Especially red-headed woodpeckers, they like open woodlands, savannahs,” Bradley said. “That’s something that we’ve lost a lot of in our state.” 
“If we can focus on a bird that needs a little bit of help, that’s a striking bird that is in everyone’s backyard … that really kind of brings the community in,” she said. 
Finding the ‘snags’ among the forest 
Walking through the brush, Bradley and her colleague Anna Claire Rogers come across a wooden bird box attached further up a tree. The box, blending in with the woods, is one of the ways they’ve been trying to bring the community together around these birds.
Woodpeckers usually prefer their homes to be “snags,” or dying and dead trees among the forest that woodpeckers can drill into to make cavities for nests or to store their food. But if a woodpecker can’t find a suitable snag, then a bird box can serve as an alternative home. 
“Forests don’t have to be pristine, or what we think of as pristine. They’re living in these dying trees, ” said Claire Rogers, also an extension associate at the university. “Everything is used.” 
Extension associates at the university have held workshops this year to bring the community in with their grant-funded work; one of the workshops focused on identifying trees, while another focused on building the bird boxes themselves. They’ve placed three boxes so far over the approximately 10 acres of woods they’re focusing on along the campus trail. 
Bradley and Claire Rogers credit the funding from the National Wildlife Federation for giving them the resources to go about their work transforming the woods. They’ve been able to buy chainsaws, loppers and handsaws along with herbicide and chemical sprayers to combat invasive plant species.

Clearing out the sheer prevalence of invasive species in the woods is something that Claire Rogers specializes in. She easily points out where a mess of thorny, red-hued wineberry branches reach out of the ground, or where green Japanese honeysuckle leaves continue to grow in the middle of winter. 
These invasive species can crowd out native plants on the forest floor. Japanese honeysuckle and winter creeper vines can grow aggressively fast, even climbing trees, Claire Rogers said, harming a tree’s health with thickets of vines.  Native birds such as the Kentucky warbler or prairie warbler need a diversity of plants and growth as habitat for nesting and food. 
A “monoculture” of invasive plants essentially deprives native birds of that flora diversity. 
“That results in a lot of different things, but mostly the suppression of our forest floors or our grassland corridors, suppression of those native species that our wildlife depends on,” Claire Rogers said.

Building campus connections
Bradley and Claire Rogers have had plenty of support in their conservation efforts from the local bird watching community. 
Gary Spandel, a retired employee with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources and the secretary of the Frankfort Audubon Society, has been visiting campus at least once a month to take a survey of the birds around the woods. 
He helped with intensive surveying of campus in 2023 that found 92 species of birds, ranging from hawks to turkey vultures to the red-bellied woodpecker. 
“I walk that Thorobred Trail pretty regularly,” Spandel said. “KSU is very lucky. It is kind of a forested campus.”

Another benefit Spandel sees with the grant-funded conservation effort: getting Kentucky State University students more involved with the nature next door to them. 
“The advantage of even a handful of acres next to campus is, you know, hopefully that will influence the students there,” Spandel said. “Those are our future.” 
Bradley and Claire Rogers see the campus forest as a “classroom” of sorts, too. Bradley said students don’t always want to drive out to the university’s educational farm, and having the natural environment close by to engage students is a plus. 
For now, they plan to wait until the spring to potentially add more bird boxes when woodpeckers are seeking new cavities to use and new homes to find. 
“There’s so much opportunity out here for it to just be better, and that’s what we’re working on,” Bradley said.

(Emily Jones/WABE)This coverage is made possible through a partnership between WABE and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
On the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia, a line of large chest coolers waits outside Wise Brothers Processing. Inside them, skinned deer lie packed in ice, ready to be cut into cubes, ground up, or made into sausage, depending on the customer’s order. Once ready, the meat is wrapped and placed in the freezer for the hunters to take back home.
This is all pretty standard for deer hunters, the way animals they shoot become meat to feed their families. But a lot of this meat isn’t going back to the hunters who brought it — it’s bound for a soup kitchen in the heart of Savannah.
“The charity that we use, they feed 250-plus people, three times a day,” said Debra Wise, who runs the business along with the rest of her family. They’ve sent 500 pounds of ground venison to Old Savannah City Mission so far this year, she said.
The Wises are taking part in the Georgia Wildlife Federation’s Hunters for the Hungry program. Georgia hunters are allowed to kill up to 12 deer in a year, but many don’t have the freezer space to keep them all or don’t need that much meat to feed their families. Hunters for the Hungry allows them to donate the extra. The state recently increased funding to $350,000 annually, allowing the program to expand from six processors to 56 and add freezer trailers to store additional meat. This year, the program has set a goal of collecting 140,000 pounds of donations, which the state Department of Natural Resources estimates can feed 560,000 people.
“They reached out to us and asked us if we would be interested in accepting the deer for the hunter program, and of course we jumped right on it,” Wise said. “Anything to help someone out, we’re all about it.”
Each processor donates the meat and distributes it within their local community. Hunters for the Hungry isn’t specifically designed to address rural hunger, and some meat — including the Wise Brothers’ — goes to city-based charities. But since most processors are located out in the country, where the hunting is, a lot of the donations end up staying there. 
Across Georgia, nearly 15% of families are food insecure, meaning they have limited or uncertain access to adequate food, according to Feeding America. Some of the highest rates are in rural counties. Rural Hancock County, nestled between Atlanta and Augusta, has the highest rate in the country of children facing food insecurity, at 47%. Nationwide, 86% of counties with the highest food insecurity rates are rural.
The hunger rates in rural areas stand in contrast to the amount of food produced there. For example, in Georgia agriculture is the biggest industry. The state is first in the country for broiler chickens, hatching eggs and peanuts, and produces significant amounts of beef, dairy, corn and blueberries. But most of that food is produced at a large scale to supply the wider U.S. food system, going to processors and distributors before reaching grocery stores, which means the majority of people who grow food and farm animals have to rely on grocery stores to buy their food just like people in big cities. 
“Not every county or not every region has all these different products, so we rely on a food system that is able, through processing and retail, to combine all these products for the benefit of consumers,” said University of Georgia professor Vanessa Shonkwiler, who studies local food systems. “But then back to our rural food insecurity — this food system is not necessarily able to reach everyone.”
Collective reliance on that system also means impacts of climate change — even in other parts of the country or elsewhere in the world — can further undermine food security by disrupting supply chains and making prices more volatile. 
“There’s not necessarily a recipe that we can apply here and there,” Shonkwiler said. Because people are so spread out in rural areas, she added, typical solutions like food pantries aren’t always effective.
“One size doesn’t fit all. And it’s really the collaboration between different entities that makes it work or doesn’t,” Shonkwiler said.
Nonprofits, churches, universities and other groups have taken many approaches to rural hunger. Some of Shonkwiler’s students recently conducted feasibility studies of different models, including a small neighborhood grocery store and a mobile grocery truck. Some nonprofits actually run small grocery stores. Another organization Shonkwiler works with is preparing to try out a model that’s worked in Europe, in which a self-service grocery store is set up in a shipping container for people to access essentials without the added expense of staffing.
The common thread to efforts that succeed, Shonkwiler said, is the level of buy-in from local leaders and the community, who need to be invested in the solution for it to work.
But even working models are now struggling after the 43-day government shutdown halted funding that food-aid organizations count on. “It’s directly the survival of the nonprofit here that is at stake,” Shonkwiler said.
Some have had to shut down stores or programs that serve rural Georgia, at least temporarily, so they can keep feeding people in the long term. Other federal funding cuts have hit rural food programs, too. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Childcare Access and Nutrition Systems grant program, for instance, funded a food bank, a farmers market, a mobile kitchen and other programs in rural southwest Georgia — but it was canceled earlier this year, according to Georgia U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff’s office.
For people in food deserts, living at least 10 miles from any supermarket and struggling to make ends meet, that means resources they’ve come to count on may not be available this holiday season.
But rural Georgians are finding other ways to help each other out. Beyond the state-sponsored Hunters for the Hungry program, Wise Brothers Processing often donates meat to families in need. Recently, Wise said, a local church contacted them about a family with a sick child who needed some help. They’ve sent the family venison and plan to send more soon.
“That brings joy to our hearts, to know that we’re able to help someone else when we’ve had to have help before, too,” Wise said. “It’s just, you know, the Lord has blessed us, and we’d like to bless in return.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hunters-4-hungry-georgia-1024x768.webp,,,2025-12-25 05:11:47.194737

We cover public officials’ actions — the bills they propose, debate, and pass (or don’t pass), as well as the trials they hold, the lawsuits they file, and the elections they win or lose. 
But we also tell the stories of Connecticut residents.
That storytelling can take several forms. Sometimes, it’s a story about how an old or new law is affecting people’s lives. Other times, it’s a quirky, under-the-radar story about life in our state that may or may not have a direct tie to public policy.
Our top 10 stories this year, defined by engaged minutes — the total amount of time people spent reading them — exemplify that mix. The list includes part of an investigation that led to legislative change, the verdict in a high-profile trial, practical information about energy charges and new laws, and a feature on the nation’s oldest public ferry.

On the ground, that promise hasn’t materialized."" (Getty Images)Every morning, parents walk into child care programs across New Hampshire carrying more than backpacks and diaper bags. They’re carrying worries about rent, utilities, health insurance, groceries, and whether their paycheck will last through the month. These pressures aren’t abstract. They shape daily decisions for families trying to stay afloat in an increasingly expensive state.
At the same time, New Hampshire is navigating major fiscal choices that will determine whether essential services remain stable or become harder to sustain. Those decisions often happen quietly, but their consequences show up quickly in places like child care programs.
From inside a nonprofit child care setting, the disconnect is hard to miss. I work closely with educators and families who are living these pressures every day. Child care is a labor-intensive, essential service that keeps the workforce moving. Programs operate on razor-thin margins, employ dozens of workers, and support hundreds of families who rely on stable, affordable care in order to work.
Yet child care providers are frequently told that broad economic strategies, particularly those focused on reducing business costs, will eventually benefit workers and families. On the ground, that promise hasn’t materialized.
For most child care programs, marginal financial relief does not translate into meaningful change. It doesn’t allow programs to hire additional staff, raise wages, expand capacity, or lower tuition. Staffing costs drive child care expenses, and unlike large corporations, programs can’t absorb losses or offset them elsewhere. Families, meanwhile, are already stretched to their limit.
New Hampshire has pursued business-friendly fiscal policies for years, yet affordability has only grown worse. Housing costs continue to rise. Workforce shortages persist. Child care remains scarce and expensive. The benefits of these policies have flowed unevenly, while the strain on essential services has intensified.
When state revenue declines or becomes less predictable, the impact doesn’t disappear. It shows up in communities, in municipalities, and in the programs families depend on. Funding uncertainty makes it harder to sustain child care scholarships, workforce supports, and other systems that allow parents to stay employed and children to thrive.
In child care programs across the state, the consequences are already visible. Parents worry about whether they can afford another year of care. Educators love their work but struggle to keep up with rising rents and everyday costs. Programs are forced into impossible decisions that affect staff retention, enrollment, and long-term viability.
That instability doesn’t strengthen the economy — it weakens it.
When child care becomes less accessible or less reliable, parents can’t work consistently. When parents can’t work, employers lose staff. Communities lose services. And working people end up paying more, often through higher costs and higher property taxes.
A strong economy isn’t built on hope or trickle-down assumptions. It’s built on smart, balanced investments in the systems that allow people to participate fully in the workforce. Child care, housing, health care, and education are not side issues; they are economic infrastructure.
From my vantage point inside a nonprofit child care program, the connection is clear. Our economy depends on whether families can access care and whether the workforce providing that care can afford to stay. Fiscal decisions that overlook this reality risk deepening the very affordability crisis they claim to address.
If we want a stable workforce and strong communities, we must evaluate economic choices through the lens of the people and systems that hold everything together.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/childcareinvestment-1024x695.jpeg,,,2025-12-25 05:11:47.194737

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)As people who are close to the news, like myself and the other members of the Maine Morning Star team, 2025 was, to put it bluntly, a lot. But it is our life’s work to take in that flood of updates and information and present it in a way that is useful and hopefully engaging.
Reflecting on the year behind us, and bracing for what’s to come, I asked the reporters — Emma Davis, AnnMarie Hilton and Eesha Pendharkar — about what they saw as the biggest stories of the year, and also the reporting that gave them joy and helped fuel their drive to keep going.
Several themes emerged for them this year, namely economic issues and how changes at the federal level were compounding challenges for people in Maine. 
“I feel like I didn’t go more than two days without writing about energy prices or anything energy-cost related,” said Hilton.
Stories about the price of power ran the gamut, from Central Maine Power’s proposed rate hike and the public opposition to it, to extensive legislative debate over reforming the state’s net energy billing program, to President Donald Trump’s halt of offshore wind development. 
Reporting on how Mainers are coping with rising energy costs, Hilton said one of the questions that often arises is how states are balancing the need to transition away from fossil fuels and adhere to their climate goals while considering the cost to ratepayers — particularly as the federal government has increasingly pulled back from helping subsidize low-emission technologies and the expansion of renewable energy.
“Cost of living is such a driver for people’s politics right now,” Hilton said, pointing out that many people “are turning to politicians because they want answers and they want help, and so it’s become such a political thing because they are looking to them to solve that problem.” 
Similarly, Pendharkar noted that even the most local stories this year seemed to be driven, at least in part, by the actions of the Trump administration and how those have “trickled down to Maine.”
With her focus on health care and education, among other beats, she’s reported extensively on cuts to Medicaid and other changes that will dramatically increase the cost of health care for many Mainers. She also pointed to other federal changes, such as ongoing threats to food aid and proposed cuts to housing funds, and noted how these often have a compounding effect.
This is even the case for issues and stories that are more insulated from federal changes. For example, the use of restraint and seclusion in Maine schools — which Pendharkar examined in a series produced as part of a fellowship with the University of Southern California Center for Health Journalism — is exacerbated by a lack of special education services, which have been cut by the U.S. Department of Education.
“There’s just an intentional effort on the federal level to move away from providing supports to people who most need it and I think those stories reflect that shift and how we are coping with those services being taken away,” Pendharkar said. 
This year, a large part of our role as journalists has been to “pick and choose for readers what is important, to pay attention to the implications, to continue to press officials in terms of what’s happening, and hopefully overall to be able to cut through the noise and present stories for people that actually provide clarity and help in some way,” said Davis. 
Davis has closely followed both the debate about immigration enforcement in Maine, as well as what it looks like on the ground. For example, Davis developed a relationship with Wells Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam, who explained why she elected for Wells to be the only agency in the state to sign a contract with immigration authorities (which was later rescinded after public outcry). Davis said this “gave our readers unique insight into the department’s thinking about the partnership.”
Davis also broke the news that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had cut $5 million in grants to research per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) mitigation. Her reporting also highlighted how the federal agency had given conflicting reasons as to why it canceled the funding, some of which was awarded to the Mi’kmaq Nation and Passamaquoddy Tribe. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree cited her coverage when pressing the EPA administrator on the issue.
These stories and others show how our specific focus on state policy can “paint a better picture for people” who are trying to keep up with all the news and changes coming from the federal government. 
Favorite stories
It’s hard to reflect on this past year in Maine without thinking about the state’s ongoing conflict with the White House in regards to the rights of transgender students.
With her background as a national reporter for EdWeek focused on diversity and inclusion, Pendharkar was well-suited to take it on. And while many stories focused on the Trump administration’s various investigations and threats, as well as the legislative debate, Pendharkar said one of her favorite stories of the year featured the voices of trans students who showed up at the State House last spring to protest and speak out against a slate of bills that sought to roll back their access to sports and other rights. 
Pendharkar said it allowed Maine Morning Star “to put real faces on the issue of trans students being attacked and they were able to stand up there and say what that means to them.”
Asked her favorite story of the year, Hilton also pointed to a piece she did that highlighted the person at the heart of a policy debate.
Since Arthur Bernard lost his son Arthur Strout in the 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston, he dedicated his life to advocating for tougher gun laws in Maine. His drive helped lead the successful grassroots effort to pass a red flag law at the ballot box in November. After Bernard was honored by the Maine Gun Safety Coalition, Hilton had a conversation with him during which he reflected on that work and what he still hopes to accomplish. 
Reflecting on the stories she’s told this year, Davis said she enjoyed travelling to Caribou to report on one of Graham Platner’s town hall-style meetings, during which he made a direct appeal to U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ former neighbors and others about how they are thinking about the political novice who is challenging Maine’s longtime senior senator. 
Next year’s Senate election, including Platner’s primary race against Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, “shows we are at a really interesting point in time in our political discourse — or reckoning,” Davis said.  
“Getting to hear directly from people about why they are still attracted to him despite the controversies, or how they are thinking about who they want to lead next and what type of leadership they want to see,” she said, will be a major story carrying into next year.
While Maine’s U.S. Senate race and 2nd Congressional District election to replace outgoing U.S. Rep. Jared Golden will capture national attention, Pendharkar noted that the race for governor is also going to be “pivotal.” 
The Democratic stronghold has “helped buffer Mainers from many impacts of federal policy,” but with an open race for Mill’s seat, as well as many tight legislative races, that could change. 
We wrap up the year with a lot of questions about the direction of the state and nation, as well as what will be done to ensure people in Maine can afford to stay healthy and keep the lights on. But we look forward to hearing from our readers, telling your stories, and doing our best to inform and educate about how the decisions made in the halls of power carry into your day to day.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MtBattyStar-scaled-e1766076781581-1024x729.jpeg,,,2025-12-25 04:57:01.750785

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)There’s a reason Ebenezer Scrooge hovers over Christmas.
English author Charles Dickens created the miserable skinflint back in 1843 for “A Christmas Carol,” the novella that has spawned too much cultural detritus to estimate. Scrooge persists because he’s the way so many people feel about the holiday, if you caught them away from family or friends.
Sometimes, you don’t want to be merry. Sometimes, you don’t want to celebrate with your coworkers. Sometimes you want to pull your coat around yourself, hurry home and eat soup in front of a roaring fire before heading to bed.
I bet that sounds like the perfect Christmas to some of my readers this morning. Depending on the year, it might sound that way to me.
The joy of Christmas, of course, is that we don’t have to experience it alone if we don’t want to. We can meet with family and friends or attend community gatherings. The holiday lives within the connections that we make.
Yet Scrooge stands for more than isolation, I think. He represents a certain perverse joy in refusing to be indoctrinated with seasonal frivolity. Maybe Christmas carols make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. Maybe you would rather eat Chinese takeout than prepare a sumptuous turkey dinner. In which case, you can join Ebenezer with a hearty, “Bah, humbug!”
Frankly, I’m ready to yell “Bah, humbug” at much of the world after this past year. Let’s never do this again, 2025.


 
Remember, Scrooge’s sin in Dickens’ story doesn’t have much to do with the holiday of Christmas itself. The day serves as a signpost in a time travel story. The heartless businessman has undervalued the people around him and the difference they make to the world.
You could learn exactly the same lesson on Arbor Day, if you wanted. And you won’t have to eat eggnog or mess with mistletoe, either.
Finally, you just have to hand it to Scrooge: He was a Victorian diva. No one without theatrical flair would declare: “If I could work my will, every idiot who goes about with ‘Merry Christmas’ on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!”
Tell me you wouldn’t want to get together with Scrooge and hate-watch some reality TV. He would be a natural. Either at that or lambasting enemies on social media.
Yes, yes, I understand. Scrooge needed to treat poor Bob Cratchit better. Yet PolitiFact crunched the numbers back in 2022 and found that “Cratchit was making far more than the average worker in London during the Victorian era.” His 15 shillings a week work out to about $21.44 an hour, one expert said.
Vindication for misunderstood Ebenezer, I say. He wanted to make some money and be left alone with his ghost friends.
Anyway, I’ve taken enough of your time this morning. You have family to wake, presents to open, food to make and share. But if you have a Scrooge in your life — or if you perhaps embody some Scrooge-like tendencies — don’t fret. Christmas has places for the happy and grumpy among us alike.
He can eat at his own table if he causes too much trouble.

The state’s projected budget deficit sits at $471 million, pretty close to the $500 million target for spending cuts set by Gov. Jim Pillen.
This budget-cutting session starts a political year in which Nebraska could see competitive races for Congress in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District and the U.S. Senate, plus the possibility of a 2026 rematch from the 2022 GOP primary for governor.
Nebraskans don’t need reminding of what happens when elected leaders need to goose supporters to show up. Many can close their eyes and hear the familiar promises of property tax relief offset with loosely defined cuts to waste and fraud.
But stop before we reach the point when political interests align into camps that argue who will be the losers of what they will again describe as a zero-sum game. One that often isn’t. 
Take a deep breath and relax. 
Because no matter your politics or beliefs, this season is set aside for breaks from the daily grind. It’s meant for love, kindness and reflection. And to remind us to think of our neighbors, friends and family. 
To remember that people who are hungry need to be fed, that people who are sick need care, that people who are old and young need love and that we are all part of a human family that cares.

We also need to think about the people for whom this time of year brings pain, thoughts of loved ones lost and the digital-fed epidemic of loneliness. If you see someone alone, say hello.
This is also a moment to act with our thoughts and wallets to help families impacted by job loss in Lexington or elsewhere, farmers who are fighting economic disruption and more.
You’re going to be bombarded this month by appeals to help others, including by the Nebraska Examiner, the work of which we hope you’ll support.
But do what makes you and yours feel good. Not out of duty but hope.
This is not the first time Nebraska has faced headwinds, nor will it be the last. The boom and bust economic cycle is the political world’s only constant. But that means better days are coming.
Nebraskans face a number of outside influences competing for our attention, from national and international news to far-flung football games. We cannot let any of that distract from who we are.
We are a prairie people, proud and private and strong. And this is our month to celebrate what makes us one. We chose to live here. This is home. And no matter our fights, I’m glad you’re here.

Wes Moore's favorite statistics is the state's 96,000-unit housing shortage, but analysts and advocates say the number is more complicated than it seems at first blush. (File photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Since he took office in 2023, Gov. Wes Moore (D) has made housing a focus of his administration, and nearly every speech, proclamation and press release since then has featured the state’s 96,000-unit housing shortage.
Does that mean there are 96,000 unhoused people in the state? Hardly. The number is the end product of a complicated formula that measures “latent demand” for housing, but analysts say it’s a solid number and a good starting point for discussions on the issue.
“These are regional measures of housing ecosystems,” said Anjali Kolachalam, policy manager for Up for Growth, a nationwide nonprofit that focuses on easing the far-reaching housing crisis through new housing development.
“What it doesn’t mean is that you can look out your window and see hundreds of thousands of people unhoused … that there are 100,000 people on the streets of Maryland waiting for a house.”
The number comes from Up For Growth’s Housing Underproduction Report. The organzation released the 2025 Housing Underproduction Report late last month, which nudged Moore’s favorite statistic down slightly, from a 96,000-unit shortage for the 2023 report to a 94,000-unit housing shortage for 2025.
The report compares available housing units to the “latent demand” of housing in a region, based on the housing market, Kolachalam explains.
“Underproduction is basically a measure of ‘housing you have’ and ‘housing you need,’” she said. “The ‘housing you have’ is basically the existing housing units, second and vacation homes and uninhabitable units. These are units that are currently renter or owner occupied, or they couldn’t be inhabited anyways.”
“Housing you need” reflects demand and includes households that “should have formed but didn’t” due to high housing costs or lack of options, she said.
High housing costs are driving people out of Maryland, new state report finds

“Missing households is basically a measure of latent demand,” Kolachalam said. “Latent demand is represented by kids who can’t move out of their parents’ place. Or, people who have more than one roommate when maybe they are looking to live alone because they are a little bit older.”
In the 2025 analysis, Up for Growth determined that nationwide housing underproduction reached 3.78 million units, according to the most recent report reflecting 2023 data. That’s a decrease from the previous report, which found a 3.85 million unit underproduction nationally. Underproduction peaked during the 2021 housing market at 3.89 million units.
The report shows a similar decrease in Maryland over the last two years. The 2023 Housing Underproduction Report shows that Maryland faced an underproduction of 96,000 units in 2021, which is the figure used in a recent executive order Moore issued to reduce administrative hurdles for new development to address the “shortage of at least 96,000 housing units.”
It may seem like an improvement to Maryland’s housing supply, but analysts warn that tracking “housing underproduction” is a complicated data point.
A reduced number does not always mean that more houses have been built, though that could be a factor, the report notes. In some metro areas, such as Baltimore, reduced underproduction could indicate a decrease in demand as people leave those areas for more affordable locations.
“The modest improvement in regional housing market conditions can be linked to concurrent increases in supply and reductions in demand in urban centers,” the report said. “At the same time, housing starts and unit deliveries were strong across many of those same metro areas. High levels of permitting activity in 2022 … ushered in a 15-year production high of single-family detached homes and the highest new apartment construction since 1987.”
A recent report from the Comptroller’s office reported that from 2010 to 2023, Maryland saw 2.3 million residents move to other states. In the report, Comptroller Brooke Lierman said that outmigration is a symptom of the state’s housing affordability crisis.
The Moore administration is not taking any victory laps yet.
“The decrease of 2,000 units estimated by the report is a statistically insignificant change in a statewide context,” said a statement from the Department of Housing and Community Development. “More critical to evaluate is our current rate of housing production. At this rate, Maryland’s 94,000-unit shortage would take another 50 years to address.
Need for speed: Executive order aims to reduce administrative hurdles to new housing

“Next week, the Department will publish housing production targets for the State of Maryland that will estimate the needed production rate to solve the state’s housing shortage,” the statement said.
Regardless, housing affordability still tops the list as the No. 1 concern from Maryland voters, with nearly a quarter saying it is the biggest problem facing the state, according to polling by the Maryland Association of Realtors. It said one in three Maryland families are cost-burdened by their monthly rent or mortgage payment, including 52% of Maryland renters who pay more than 30% of their income on rent.
Meanwhile, there’s debate on how useful tracking underproduction is as a data point, as state officials, developers and advocates work to tackle housing unaffordability in the state.
“The 96,000-unit housing shortage figure is a useful starting point,” said Aaron Greenfield, director of government affairs with the Maryland Multi-Housing Association, in a written statement. He noted that Maryland has a “significant supply deficiency.”
“It helps highlight the scale of the challenge, but it does not fully capture the complexity of Maryland’s housing needs, particularly in the rental housing market,” he said. “While 96,000 units communicates the magnitude of the problem, Maryland must focus not only on the total number but also on ensuring we can actually deliver the right mix of housing across income levels.”
Matt Losak, executive director of the Montgomery County Renters Alliance, says that while looking at the state’s “underproduction” metric may help with future planning of housing needs, it does “nothing” to make housing more affordable for those struggling now.
“They’re talking about folks who would move here in the future in anticipating the growth of our population,” Losak said. “They have nothing to do with protecting or preserving the affordability and quality and stability of existing households.”
Losak and other renter advocates support policies such as “good cause evictions” and rent stabilization to help keep people comfortably housed in the state. He is skeptical of having a singular focus on building new units.
“There is a theory that we can build our way out of the unaffordability and instability, but that theory is pockmarked with numerous holes,” he said. “The landlord-developer industry is not going to build their way out of profits … While we have no problem with people building more housing, more types of housing, we just don’t believe that policy is a substitute for renter protections.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC01957-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-25 02:56:46.643234

(Photo via Discover Martin County)Dear Santa,
I know you’re already in the air delivering gifts around the world, but I hope you’ve got an emergency miracle stuffed in your big bag. Our Florida state parks could sure use your help.
You generally reserve your presents for boys and girls whose goodness is worth rewarding. Trust me when I tell you the parks are reeeeeeally good. They’re incredibly popular, drawing 28 million visitors every year and generating $75 million in revenue. Plus, they’ve won national awards four times, more than any other state park system.
Yet they’ve been treated oh so badly by the people in charge of Florida.
Last year our Duffer-in-Chief, Gov. Ron DeSantis, tried to put golf courses, hotels, and pickleball courts in several of the parks. In the uproar that ensued, the Legislature passed a law that said no governor could do something so stupid ever again. That wasn’t the exact wording, but it was certainly the intent.
The Legislature also told the Department of Environmental Protection to compile a list of all the things that the parks DO need. We finally got the DEP report, Santa, and it’s a doozy.
“Florida state parks face $759 million backlog of needed repairs, state report finds,” read the headline in the Tampa Bay Times story.
The money is needed to “address aging infrastructure, safety improvements, accessibility upgrades and modernization of essential facilities such as restrooms, trails, utilities and visitor centers across Florida’s 175 state parks,” the DEP report says. (It’s actually 176, but who’s counting?)
Santa, I read the report and said that word that gets Ralphie in so much trouble in “A Christmas Story.” No, not fudge.
Reading the report was like seeing an online review of a once-great hotel that’s gone to seed. The elevators get stuck, the kitchen constantly runs out of crucial ingredients, and the bathroom plumbing backs up once a week.
The list of what’s in need of repair includes the parks’ visitor centers, cabins, pavilions, boardwalks, fences, restrooms, boat ramps — you name it. Not to mention trying to protect or improve the water quality in the springs, rivers, lakes, and beaches owned by us taxpayers.
I’m not going to tell you that everything in the report is the gospel truth. For instance, I noticed that for the state’s most popular park, Honeymoon Island in Gov. DeSantis’ hometown of Dunedin, the report says the campsites need repair. Honeymoon Island is a wonderful place to visit, but only during the day. It has no campground.
Nevertheless, enough of the report is so dead on that I think it should be required reading for everyone who has any control over the state’s purse strings. Santa, this is such an emergency, I’m ready to dial both 911 and the law offices of Morgan & Morgan.
Susannah Randolph via Sierra Club
Instead of regarding the report’s findings as a staggering burden, though, “this is a real opportunity,” said Sierra Club Florida Chapter Director Susannah Randolph, — no, not Rudolph, Santa, I said RANdolph.
Her organization is lobbying for the state to start filling all these needs like an empty stocking hanging from the mantle. To make this wish come true, Mr. Kringle, may require a miracle or two.
Now the question is: Will the nitwits who let Florida’s greatest treasures get so terribly tarnished be willing to spend the money to polish them back to a bright shine?
Tell me you closed it
Santa, did you know that Florida’s state park system is a wild wonder? It gives us a glimpse of what the state looked like before so much ugly sprawl paved over everything.
You should come check it out once you’re done with your worldwide run. Replace your toasty red suit with a vented fishing shirt, some cargo shorts, and flip-flops. You can choose from sites spanning nearly 800,000 acres and go camping, hiking, biking, canoeing, kayaking, or simply gazing in open-mouthed wonder.
There’s also plenty of quirky kitsch, as befits a Florida institution. What other state can claim to have a park employing a school of professional mermaids like Weeki Wachee Springs State Park?
Weeki Wachee mermaids via Visit Florida
The first Florida state parks that preserved natural sites date to the 1930s. They were not created out of some grand vision to attract tourists. They were make-work projects for the Civilian Conservation Corps, an agency that was part of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal to beat the Great Depression. The work turned out pretty well, if you ask me.
Those first parks, including Hillsborough River State Park, Highlands Hammock State Park, and Myakka River State Park, are all still amazing places to visit. These are all gifts from the past for us modern-day Floridians, a reminder of what our state once looked like.
With the state’s oldest parks nearing the century mark, you’d think the state would be sprucing everything up for the celebration like the buffers, stuffers, and stylists of Oz prepping Dorothy and her pals to meet the Wizard.
Alas, Santa, some of the best parts of the parks are closed for repairs or replacement and have been for some time.
Take, for instance, the Hobe Mountain Tower in Jonathan Dickinson State Park — the park near Hobe Sound where, just last year, the governor wanted to build not one, not two, but THREE golf courses.
The 27-foot tower sits atop an ancient sand dune that rises 86 feet above sea level. Thanks to that impressive elevation, it provides some of the greatest views anywhere in our flat-as-Flat-Stanley state.
But the tower has been shut down since last year. That’s when an engineer’s report spelled out how badly deteriorated it had become.
“The report documented the rot in the wooden parts and rust in the steel parts,” said Jim Howe, president of the Friends of Jonathan Dickinson State Park. “Many bolts have rusted to the point they no longer provide real connection.”
Howe told me he read the engineer’s report sitting in the park manager’s office. Halfway through, Howe said, he looked up at the park manager and said, “Tell me you’ve closed it.”
The manager replied, “The minute I finished reading that.”
The friends group has been trying to raise the money to tear down the old tower and build a replacement. So far, they’ve collected about $25,000, Howe said. That’s not nearly enough.
“I think when it’s all done it may be a half million or more,” he told me.
Gee Santa, wouldn’t it be nice if, instead of trying to put golf courses in there, the state instead paid to put up a new tower?
How we got here
Now Santa, you may be wondering: How did we manage to let our parks get into such sorry shape?
Matt Caldwell via Florida State Parks Association
When I asked Florida State Parks Foundation president Matt Caldwell that question, he was quick to blame our recent spate of storms with names like Matthew, Ian, Helene, and Milton.
“A lot of our parks were right on the front lines for impact from the hurricanes,” the former legislator told me. Repairing the damage from those impacts took precedence over the routine maintenance and additional expansion, he said.
As always when the subject involves parks, I contacted Eric Draper, a Florida native who served as Florida state parks director from 2017 until 2021.
To Draper, one of the signs that we have serious problems is the amount of work that the staff’s own cabins and offices need. Nearly every page of the DEP report names staff housing as derelict and in need of repair.
Eric Draper. when he was Florida State Parks director, via Eric Draper
Year after year, Draper said, the staff would ask for money to make the repairs and improvements mentioned in the DEP report. Year after year, he said, the money they needed was not forthcoming from the Legislature.
I suspect the problem was that our fine legislators misconstrued what state park funding stood for. They looked at it as a sop to the environmentalists, never a favored group with our lawmakers. The greens never bring them enough green, if you know what I mean.
But that’s like thinking that only members of the local Tourism Development Council care about tourism. Lots of businesses depend on tourism to meet their bottom lines, and the same is true for the parks. Lots of businesses depend on it.
I think the legislators should have grasped that by fixing the parks, they would be employing ecology to boost our economy. The parks are a major tourist draw. Keeping them in good working order ensures the tourists have a good experience and are likely to come back.
Do the folks at Disney or Universal let those attractions fall into disrepair? They do not.
But we have, and now the bill has come due.
What happens next
The big question, Santa, is whether our elected leaders will take this report as a road map to fix the problem. Or will they ignore it, the way they did the scientific report on how to clean up our toxic algae bloom problem.
The sponsor of the bill that called for the report says she’s ready to get to work on its findings.
State Sen. Gayle Harrell via Florida Senate
“This gives us the basis to start planning and putting resources into our parks,” state Sen. Gayle Harrell, R-Stuart, told the Times. “It’s a first step to making sure our parks remain the best in the country, and it gives us a starting point.”
We shall soon see if she’s able to build enough support to start paying for some of the necessary work. Remember, though, that in the session that happened earlier this year, the Legislature didn’t want to spend more than a mere $15 million on park facilities improvement.
They also went back on their word from the year before and repealed a requirement that the millions of dollars rolling in from Seminole sports gambling would be spent on buying property that needed to be preserved.
Meanwhile, the legislators enabled a Louisiana developer to get an $83 million payday for 4 acres of land in Destin that wasn’t on anybody’s preservation list. Paying a campaign contributor was worth more to them than rebuilding our broken parks. Does that make any sense to you? Me neither.
There is one bright spot in all this, and in a most unlikely place.
I know you’re probably planning to dump 16 tons of coal at the Governor’s Mansion. He’s certainly due some serious payback for siphoning millions from needy kids to pay political consultants. But hold up a second.
I don’t know how you did it, Santa — did you send the Ghost of Christmas Past? The Ghost of Christmas Present? The Ghost of No Political Future? Whatever you did, it worked. Gov. DeSantis recently announced he’s proposing $50 million to be spent on the state parks facilities in 2026.
“That’s a big ask,” Draper told me.
Randolph of the Sierra Club took DeSantis’ support for a good sign too, and said, “We’re going to push it all the way.”
So, Santa, I hope you can bring our current crop of lawmakers the intestinal fortitude to follow Harrell’s lead and start fixing the parks. A new spine and a noisy conscience would help, too. Fixing this park repair backlog would be the greatest gift you could give all 23 million of us Floridians.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hobe-Mountain-boardwalk-via-Discover-Martin-County-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-25 00:11:47.203562

(Photo by Fiordaliso/Getty Stock Images)Their complaints are often ignored or brushed aside, but fibromyalgia sufferers see some hope in a recent court ruling that Social Security Administration officials were wrong to discount an Anne Arundel County woman’s description of the suffering the condition caused her.
Crystal Hultz was first denied Social Security disability benefits back in 2014. Throughout her many attempts to challenge the decision, administrative law judges believed her subjective testimony was not properly supported by medical evidence.
But in a Dec. 15 opinion,  a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that in cases where there are no objective medical tests or markers to identify debilitating conditions, like fibromyalgia, subjective testimony must have more weight.
“This case is about crediting a patient’s accounts of the chronic, debilitating, and little-understood illness fibromyalgia,” Circuit Judge Roger L. Gregory wrote in the opinion.
“Fibromyalgia is a serious and mysterious condition, disproportionately affecting women, that our current science is incapable of observing through objective medical testing. Accordingly, we must give due weight to Ms. Hultz’s subjective testimony about the severity of her symptoms,” Gregory wrote.
He said the administrative law judges and lower courts that supported the initial denial were wrong to disregard her struggle with fibromyalgia, reversed the denial and sent the case back for administrators to calculate Hultz’s benefits.
Jeffrey R. Scholnick, the attorney representing Hultz, said she cried on the phone when he called her last week about the ruling.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I called her on Monday and said, ‘Congratulations, people believe you now,’” he said in a recent interview.
Scholnick said the ruling will help other people get disability benefits when they are struggling with debilitating conditions that cannot be detected through definitive medical tests.
“It’s the nature of this disease (fibromyalgia). Because people don’t see it, they don’t believe you,” he said.
Hultz is one of about 4 million people in the United States who struggle with fibromyalgia, a condition that causes pain all over the body, and can lead to fatigue as well as emotional and mental distress, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Diagnosing fibromyalgia largely relies on a patient’s subjective description of symptoms, as there are no medical tests that can objectively confirm the condition.
Hultz’s symptoms began in 2013, severely limiting her ability to work. She applied for disability the next year.
According to court documents, fibromyalgia and lupus interfered with her ability to do daily tasks, such as “opening jars, handwriting, turning keys, preparing meals, performing heavy household chores, accomplishing yard work, and carrying heavier objects with the hand that suffered from pain and numbness.”
After appealing the initial denial in 2014, what followed was a series of court hearings, denials and appeals spanning over a decade.
Throughout the process, administrative law judges disregarded fibromyalgia as a feature of her disability. One judge omitted the condition entirely when denying her benefit, and one physician consulted for Hultz’s case believed she had a “component of ‘malingering.’”
Lynne Kennedy Matallana, CEO and founder of the National Fibromyalgia Association, said that people in Hultz’s situation often get “lost in the system” and can give up trying to seek out disability benefits.
“We still have situations where the diagnosis of fibromyalgia and the understanding of it continues to be debated,” she said. “Those of us dealing with it are initially in such horrible straits, because we went from living very happy lives and being able to take care of families and things to all of a sudden having an illness.
“There are those people, like this woman, that get lost in the system and never get the help that they need,” Matallana said.










Fibromyalgia is a serious and mysterious condition, disproportionately affecting women, that our current science is incapable of observing through objective medical testing. Accordingly, we must give due weight to Ms. Hultz’s subjective testimony about the severity of her symptoms.


– U.S. 4th Circuit Judge Roger L. Gregory


Meanwhile, other physicians working with Hultz, along with family members, testified that her fibromyalgia led to days of fatigue and pain that often left her bedridden.
Her luck began to change in 2020, when Gregory ruled in a similar case, Arakas v. Commissioner, affirming that Social Security officials must take subjective testimony into account for conditions that do not have a tangible test or medical marker to identify them.
Gregory wrote in Hultz’s case that the court “must be guided by our precedent in Arakas v. Commissioner, which held that ALJs (administrative law judges) may not rely on objective medical evidence even as just one of multiple factors to discount a claimant’s subjective complaints regarding symptoms of fibromyalgia.”
Judge G. Steven Agee agreed with the majority that the administrative law judges in Hultz’s case should have put more weight on her subjective testimony. But in a partial dissent, he said he believed the court went too far in its remedy.
“Rather than simply vacate the ALJ’s decision and remand for reconsideration of Hultz’s claim, it went a step further, opting to outright reverse the ALJ’s decision and deem Hultz entitled to disability benefits in the first instance,” Agee wrote. “In doing so, it departed from the process courts typically employ when an ALJ errs.”
Matallana says it’s important for people with fibromyalgia and other disabilities to push through court challenges to receive benefits.
“I do recommend that people find an attorney who will represent them,” she said. “When you’re sick, you don’t know how to get up the energy and the strength to fight something like this.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1428788053-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 23:56:35.533632

(Photo by Peter Dazeley/Getty Stock Photo)Maryland lawmakers may again consider legalizing physician-assisted suicide (PAS) this session. Before they do, they should confront an uncomfortable truth: In a state where African Americans already face stark inequalities in health care, PAS, even if intended compassionately, would introduce the power of state-authorized death into a system that has long failed to protect Black Marylanders’ health, dignity and, too often, their lives.
The Maryland Department of Health documents clear and persistent inequalities in health outcomes in this state. Black residents are more likely to die of cancer even though they are less likely than whites to develop it. Black infants die at more than double the rate of white infants. Black mothers die in pregnancy at twice the rate of white mothers. And the proportion of Black physicians in the state is far lower than their share of the population. What happens when we add the power of prescribing death to a health care system that already does not treat all lives equally?
This concern is the subject of my new Maryland Family Institute Research Brief, “Knee on the Neck: Assisted Suicide and the African-American Experience in Maryland.” The title reflects the sober reality: For Black Marylanders, PAS risks magnifying the ultimate outcome under the guise of impartial health care.

African Americans have good reason to be cautious about giving physicians greater authority over life-and-death decisions. Georgetown scholars Patricia King and Leslie Wolf have observed that Black patients “have been abused, neglected and exploited” within American medicine and therefore “have reason to believe that their lives are not valued in the same way as whites.”
That historical memory is not distant. It echoes today in biased diagnostic patterns, under-treated pain and survival gaps across multiple diseases.
PAS does not correct these injustices. It amplifies them.
In states that have legalized PAS, very few physicians are willing to participate.Oregon, the first state to adopt the practice, has roughly 13,000 physicians, yet in a recent year, only 146 wrote any lethal prescriptions. Just 32 doctors wrote most of them, and one doctor wrote 51. When life-ending authority is so concentrated, the biases of a tiny number of persons will dominate its practice. Maryland would be naive to assume that racial prejudice, whether conscious or unconscious, would play no role in determining which patients are encouraged toward death.
PAS can be especially harmful in Black communities, where churches and pastors play a central role in affirming that every life, even in suffering, has God-given worth and dignity. For many African Americans who have spent a lifetime resisting messages of inferiority, a physician’s authoritative suggestion of suicide can easily, if unintentionally, displace the preaching of hope and faith with a darker message: Your life is more burdensome than valuable. Your death may be the more reasonable path.
Maryland need not guess how this plays out. Three decades ago, after extensive review, a bipartisan New York task force unanimously rejected PAS, warning it would be “profoundly  dangerous” for stigmatized populations and impossible to regulate equitably. Maryland’s racial disparities today are no better than New York’s were then. If PAS posed “extraordinary risks” there, it poses equal if not greater risks here.
I write as a sociologist, a married Catholic priest, a father in an interracial family and a lifelong Marylander, formerly living in South Baltimore and now Prince George’s County.

‘Twas the Night Before Christmas

Thank you for letting us tell your stories, Delaware.
’Twas the night before Christmas across the First State,
A few journalists still working, though the hour grew late.
They crafted headlines with thoughtful care,
Finishing articles they were happy to share.
From Newark to Wilmington and old New Castle’s Green,
They had followed angles as a reporting team.
From Dover’s broad stretches to the curve of the bay,
They had tracked every lead throughout the days.
Across towns and counties the year’s stories grew,
With acts of compassion and traditions renewed.
Parades and performances, milestones to cheer,
The voices of neighbors that shaped the year.
Businesses celebrated triumphs and starts,
Libraries and nonprofits opened their hearts.
Families gave deeply, volunteers led the way,
And communities strengthened day after day.
Now Rehoboth lay quiet, the Bandstand at rest,
Lewes’ windows shimmered, holiday-dressed.
Cape Henlopen breezes turned colder and clear,
As beach towns settled at the close of the year.
Through Brandywine Valley where Christmas winds blow,
Greenville kept shining with a welcoming glow.
Hockessin’s houses trimmed in ribbons and pine
Stood peaceful beneath the December moonshine.
In Middletown storefronts glimmered at night,
Lanterns and candles casting warm light.
Smyrna’s bright corners felt merry and fair,
While Milford’s calm river held reflections of care.
Three counties, one mission – to share points of view,
And shine a warm light upon all of you.
As Delawareans settled in for a long cozy rest,
Delaware Live logged off and wished everyone their best.
They whispered to readers, clear, warm, and bright,
“Merry Christmas, First State, and to all a good night.”

(Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)Ashley Vance wakes up most mornings surprised by the quiet. No shouting. No searching for a safe couch. No fear of who she might encounter in a crowded shelter. For the first time in years, the 20-year-old trans woman has a door she can lock, a bed that’s hers, a future she can imagine.
But Ashley’s relief is fragile.
Her journey from foster care to shelters to the small housing program helping her today reveals a larger truth: when the child-welfare system stops at the threshold of adulthood, queer and trans youth are often left to find stable housing alone. In all of New Mexico, there are two housing programs built specifically for LGBTQ+ young people, according to Adrien Lawyer, co-Executive Director of the Transgender Resource Center of New Mexico—with limited beds, years-long waitlists, and almost no state funding.

This story originally published on New Mexico In Depth.

“I always knew who I was, so I always thought of myself as a girl,” Vance said. She was still just a kid—at 10 years of age, meant to be worrying about homework and friends—when she began her transition. By 11, her home life had become unstable, and a teacher contacted the state’s Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) after growing concerned about her well-being.The agency tried sending her back home, but after she ran away several times, they conceded she needed a safer place.
What followed, though, was a different kind of instability.
“Every time I got used to a place, CYFD would move me again. I never had time to settle. I never had time to be a kid,” she said. Some homes were crowded, others unwelcoming, and she often hid who she was to avoid trouble.
At 15, the state referred her to Casa Q, a housing program in Albuquerque for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer teens with nowhere else to go. For several years, it offered her a kind of predictability she needed: meals with housemates, weekly outings, adults who understood what it meant to be queer. “It was the first place where I felt seen,” she said.

That stability ended the day she turned 18 and, due to state rules, her placement ended automatically. New Mexico is considered “top five” in the nation for LGBTQ+ legal protections, with state policies that affirm transgender residents, according to Lawyer. Yet the state’s legal protections don’t help young queer adults aging out of foster care find safe living spaces.
After leaving Casa Q, Ashley experienced a blur of friends’ couches or city shelters. At one of the city’s largest shelters, she cried every day. “I didn’t feel safe. I had to keep myself quiet about who I was just to make it through the night. When I told people I was trans, that was a mistake,” she said. Even simple acts, like asking for respect, using her correct name and pronouns, or showing her identity, could put her at risk of harassment or exclusion.
Her search for something more than survival eventually led her back to the only programs in the state built specifically for queer and trans young people. Casa Q provided stability when she was a teenager. Casa Lola, another small program painstakingly built by the queer community for LGBTQ+ young adults struggling to access safe and stable housing, now gives her a chance to rebuild what she lost when childhood services ended but adult support never fully appeared.
Behind the Numbers: Youth Left Out
Homelessness in New Mexico has intensified sharply. A statewide annual count in January recorded 4,683 people experiencing homelessness—a more than twofold increase from 2,057 in 2021.
By one recent ranking, New Mexico had roughly 217 homeless individuals per 100,000 residents, placing it among the states with higher rates nationwide.
This year, the annual count identified 428 homeless youth in Albuquerque and 409 elsewhere, for a total of 837 youth statewide. Youth under 18 made up 22% of transitional housing and 17% of emergency shelter residents in Albuquerque, and 38% of transitional housing residents outside the metro.
The count also shows 34 individuals statewide who identify as  transgender, nonbinary, questioning, or other gender identities, but it is unclear how many are youth.
National research suggests these numbers understate the scale of LGBTQ+ youth homelessness.
Covenant House, a national nonprofit helping youth particularly vulnerable to homelessness,  estimates that about 40% of homeless youth in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ+, despite making up a small fraction of the general youth population. LGBTQ+ youth are 120% more likely to experience homelessness than their peers, according to the organization. CYFD has cited the same figures in its “Supporting Youth to Thrive” manual, acknowledging the disproportionate impact on LGBTQ+ young people.
Many end up cycling through shelters or living on the streets.
Finding Safe Harbor
In New Mexico, Casa Q is one of the rare places built to understand the needs of young queer people. The name itself reflects the mission: a safe home, “Casa,” for queer youth, “Q.”
A homeless shelter specifically for LGBTQ+ and youth of color, it serves teens escaping family rejection, homelessness, or violence. Since opening 10 years ago, it has served more than 100 young people, many arriving with nothing: no clothes, no ID, no safe adult to call.
The home is licensed by CYFD, has five bedrooms, and can serve up to eight residents at a time. “There are very few places like this. We’re the only program that’s lasted this long, and the need hasn’t slowed down,” said Executive Director Shannon Darrell.

For many teens, Casa Q is the first place where adults share their lived experience as queer people. Darrell explained, “It makes a difference when young people see themselves in the people supporting them. They feel safer. They open up faster.” Jericha Lee, the program’s director, added, “When I was younger and going through my own challenges, I didn’t have anything like Casa Q. Youth shouldn’t have to choose between a bed and their identity.”
Bella Garnet, a client advocate, said, “Unfortunately, the world is not very kind to members of the queer community, especially the trans community. A lot of our youth come from abusive homes. Their biggest challenge is trust and accepting that someone actually wants to help them.”

Ashley found that trust at Casa Q. “They taught me how to feel safe around people again,” she said.
Support continues long after residents leave. Lee said, “Just like having family, having a support system that never goes away.” Former residents can return for food, hygiene products, or a conversation, keeping a lifeline open well into adulthood.
Bridging to Adulthood
What happens when residents turn 18? Some transition to Casa Q’s Transitional Living Program (TLP), which supports young adults ages 18 to 23 in off-site apartments. Residents gain independence while receiving support with healthcare, employment, and education. They’re expected to maintain a job and savings to cover at least six months of rent.
“We meet them wherever they’re at,” Lee said. “Let’s work on finding you employment. Let’s work on school. If they do not feel prepared, we’ll work on extending it.” Two current TLP residents previously lived at Casa Q as minors.

But the program is small, with a long waitlist. “By the time clients move out, many have aged out or found other programs,” Darrell said. “We need more housing, opportunities, and funding to help these young adults succeed.”
When Ashley reached 18 years of age, there weren’t any openings in the program. But eventually she was able to find a spot at Casa Lola, across town, which operates under the Transgender Resource Center, a statewide organization addressing housing gaps for adults.
Like Casa Q, the name signals its mission: “Casa,” a home; “Lola,” honoring a trans woman who experienced chronic homelessness and died from related health consequences. Lawyer, co-Executive Director, explained, “Even when she finally got help, it was too late. Her story is a reminder of how deadly housing insecurity can be. Casa Lola bridges the gap for people who age out of youth programs or are struggling to find stable housing as adults.”
The house provides six beds, with stays up to two years. And it also has a long wait list. Since opening in early 2024, 20 people have stayed at Casa Lola. Three have completed the program and moved into permanent housing, while the others remain in the house or are continuing to work toward long-term stability. Most staff are LGBTQ+, ensuring residents are surrounded by adults who share their identities.
Krys Pomeroy, who works at Casa Lola as a resident assistant, emphasized the sense of community: “A lot of folks who come here have been through places where they weren’t seen, weren’t supported. We provide that sense of family and accountability.”

For Ashley, Casa Lola provides stability after years of uncertainty. “I have a stable living situation, and I’ve always had to be really independent. I never had a place I could call home until programs like this,” she said. “People here get me. They’ve helped me not feel like I have to hide. I feel welcomed, and if I have a bad day, I have people to come home to.”The program has also helped her set concrete goals. “I’m saving 30% of my paycheck, around $150 each time, for things like a car, an apartment, cosmetology school, and finishing my GED. For the first time in a long time, I have goals that make me feel better about myself.”    The Funding Challenge
Casa Lola and Casa Q are part of a fragile spectrum of LGBTQ+ housing. One catches youth before the system fails them; the other bridges the gap into adulthood.
Together, they highlight an urgent need for affirming housing in Albuquerque. There are similar housing programs, like New Day, Crossroads for Women, and Barrett House, but they aren’t specifically designed to be affirming spaces for the LGBTQ+ community.
Sen. Michael Padilla, D-Albuquerque, who was himself a foster youth, said aging out of care is like “the floor falling out from under you.” The stakes are high. “I looked at the data, and 70 to 77% of individuals who have ever been in foster care, and 77% of their children, end up in foster care. There is a perpetual cycle of instability,” he said. “I would say 35 to 40% of aged-out foster youth become homeless before they’re 21.”
Padilla sponsored 2019 legislation creating the state’s Fostering Connections program to help aging-out foster youth a year with housing assistance and educational support, using federal Title IV-E and Chafee Act funds. “The children that are affected by these services don’t have a bunch of high-powered lobbyists running around the Roundhouse,” he said. “I feel like I’m their lobbyist. I’m their person up there.”
But for LGBTQ+ youth specifically, Casa Q and Casa Lola fill a gap that general foster care transition programs don’t address: the need for housing where young people don’t have to hide who they are to stay safe.
Both programs face the same obstacle: funding. Casa Q’s transitional housing program relies on grants and donations. Casa Lola operates primarily through a private gift that enabled the house’s purchase, with staff pursuing grants and other resources.
Lawyer noted the challenge of expansion: “The worst thing for our communities is to say, ‘look at this wonderful thing we made for you,’ only to close it because we couldn’t fund it.”
Despite limited resources, staff continue to stretch their capacity. “It can feel heavy sometimes,” Garnett said. “But being able to be there for them in their darkest moments gives you purpose.”
Vance knows how rare her path has been. She moved from Casa Q to Casa Lola, one of the few in New Mexico to successfully navigate both programs.
But she also knows how easily it could have gone differently. “I think about the people I met in shelters who didn’t make it here,” she said. “A lot of them are still out there.”
Vance can picture a path ahead. But her story underscores what advocates say is urgent: programs like Casa Q and Casa Lola can change a life, but only if a bed is open when a young person needs one.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ashleyvance-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 17:58:27.024499

(Courtesy of Anna Keyzer)LINCOLN — A proposal from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services for changes to a Medicaid waiver allowing aging Nebraskans and those with a disability to remain at home is causing panic for some families and caregivers.
The proposal to the state’s Aged and Disabled Waiver would limit the need-determined reimbursable hours of caregivers from a current cap of 112 hours to 70. Of those hours, a paid live-in family caregiver could be reimbursed up to 40 hours, a part of the program with no current cap. 


Aged and Disabled Waiver eligibility

Be eligible for Nebraska Medicaid.
Have a disability or be over the age of 65.
Meet Nursing Facility Level of Care.
Demonstrate need for services.

More information is available here.


The annual costs that Medicaid would reimburse under the waiver would also be limited based on changes in the yearly costs of nursing home care statewide.
“If they truly do this, it’s going to be pretty devastating to our family,” said Anna Keyzer of Lincoln, who has utilized the payments for up to 112 weekly hours to help afford to care for her 21-year-old son, Simon. “I don’t know how anyone would suddenly lose 72 hours’ worth of a paid job and be OK.”
Yearly nursing home costs were $92,438 in the last fiscal year, which ended June 30. Families would need an administrative review once costs reach 150% of the annual cost ($138,657), and families could be paid as much as 175% of the cost of that care ($161,767) if they pass a clinical review from a DHHS team. 
DHHS says the changes are needed to make the program, which splits costs between the state and federal government, fiscally “sustainable.” The state faces a projected $471 million shortfall by mid-2027. Pillen is seeking to cut state spending by $500 million. DHHS is the largest state agency.

‘Pulling their lives apart’
Keyzer adopted Simon from Bulgaria in 2013, just before his 9th birthday. He weighed 18 pounds then and now weighs 72. Keyzer became his caregiver when he turned 19, and the family struggled to find outside options, including some who would quit soon after or leave during a shift. 
Simon has Renpenning syndrome, a rare genetic condition that occurs mostly in males. He is hard of hearing and blind, has auto-aggression, is tube fed and has osteoporosis because of a lack of nutrition when young.
Marie Wohlers of Crawford said her family is reimbursed for 80 weekly hours of family provided care under the AD Waiver to care for her 28-year-old daughter, Michaela. Wohlers noted that in the Nebraska Panhandle, support systems are already fairly limited, and she said families are mindful of rising costs.
“I feel like it’s pulling their lives apart, and with no support systems in place that if this happens, what happens to these individuals?” Wohlers said.










I really, truly hope that they listen to us family members, as caregivers, as taxpayers, that our opinion truly counts, because we are what the State of Nebraska is about.


– Marie Wohlers of Crawford

Michaela has Rett syndrome, a rare genetic neurological disorder that primarily affects females and causes progressive loss of motor skills and language. She is unable to move herself, can’t walk or talk, is tube fed, has severe gastrointestinal issues, is at-risk for pressure sores and has a seizure disorder. 
Wohlers said she and her husband involve Michaela in their Panhandle cow-calf ranching operation as much as possible.
Wohlers worries the proposal puts Michaela and others at a higher risk for poor health or being taken advantage of. Wohlers said the waiver is meant to give individuals a better quality of life.
“I just feel like a lot of these things are going to make things more challenging, and it’s going to limit the quality of life for a lot of individuals,” said Wohlers, a former Crawford school board member.

Proposed waiver changes

Maximum reimbursable caregiver hours, 112 hours reduced to 70 hours.

No more than 40 hours could be paid to an in-home family caregiver.
An additional 30 hours could be added, but would need to be delivered by someone outside the home.


Maximum reimbursable costs each year are based on yearly nursing home costs, which were $92,438 as calculated by DHHS.

Families would need to undergo an administrative review if costs reach 150% of the annual cost ($138,657).
Families could be paid as much as 175% of the cost of nursing home care if they pass a clinical review from a DHHS team ($161,767).

‘Preserve the program long term’

At an emergency Dec. 19 meeting of the committee, Tony Green, director of the DHHS Division of Developmental Disabilities, said the changes are needed because, for the past 10 years of the program, costs have been “far outpacing” population growth, of 34%. 
More than 10,000 Nebraskans are now using the specific Medicaid waiver, according to DHHS.
DHHS spokesperson Jeff Powell and Green said the waiver’s total costs have increased 322%, from $91 million to $383.6 million (an average of $29.3 million annually). The duo said the individual cost per person has risen 218%, from $14,610 to $46,415 (an average of $3,181 each year).
Green said the Legislature has not provided a budget to support those costs, so DHHS is trying to find an alternative route through the “normal” five-year renewal point.
“It necessitates the state doing something to preserve the program long term, or we would have to implement a waiting list,” Green told the Olmstead Advisory Committee.
One of many Medicaid waivers
Phil Gray, second vice president for the Arc of Nebraska, a statewide nonprofit that advocates for Nebraskans with intellectual disabilities, said at the Olmstead meeting that the state’s description of the proposed changes might seem “reasonable,” but the “reality” parents might face is different.
“I’m not convinced that this process is going forward in any kind of manner … that you can manage in a reasonable way without having the catastrophes we’re hearing about,” Gray said.

Gray and others note that the AD Waiver proposal follows Pillen and Green taking steps to end a services waitlist for Nebraskans with developmental disabilities. Some said they worry success for one waiver now could hurt another.
Keyzer also worries the move is “political,” so Pillen and DHHS can say they offered solutions, even if they’re not “real” or practical. She and other families noted that many family caregivers work for minimum wage ($15 an hour, effective Jan. 1), yet some agency caregivers could be paid much more per hour. 
They say the changes aren’t fiscally responsible.
“These are the most intense mama and papa bears in this state who have been protecting their loved one and … fighting every step of the way to make sure that our children are alive and are OK and are living their best life,” Keyzer said. “We will continue to fight.”
Balancing hours
Joni Thomas, an AD Waiver recipient and Olmstead advisory member, said she had polio when she was two and a half, in 1959. It was the end of the second wave of the epidemic, and though the vaccine was out and her family had received it, she was already sick. She spent nine months in the hospital, including six in an iron lung.
Thomas said her mom was given the opportunity to put her in an institution, but her mother refused, saying, “She’s my child, and if she lives through this, I’m taking her home.”

Now 68 years old, Thomas said she grew up always wanting three things out of life: to own her own place with a personal set of keys, to drive and to have a job and not what she’s facing now. Thomas retired in 2023 and founded a nonprofit to bring awareness to an “untapped” pool of talent.
“I got all of those things,” said Thomas. “But at the same time, the programs are set up to really kind of keep you impoverished.”
Thomas currently uses the AD Waiver to cover about 10 hours overnight, to help her sleep comfortably and safely, and a few hours daily so she can go to the bathroom three times a day and help prepare food, of which she said a whole-food, plant-based diet has reduced sickness and kept her out of the hospital. 
If Thomas is limited to 70 hours or more, depending on a couple of proposed exceptions, it’ll affect how many hours she has per day, including to sleep. 
The fear is also real for Thomas’ mother, who is 91 and has significant dementia. The family worries the waiver changes would cause one of Thomas’ mother’s “greatest fears in life” to come true, that she couldn’t stay at home and live out the rest of her life comfortably.

When Thomas first found out about the changes, her first thought was, “Oh my God, the whole thing I fought all my life for is going to happen to me.” 
She said care needs to be certain, and doesn’t want to rely on a volunteer to use the bathroom. She said for those questioning her opposition to living in a Medicaid facility, they should visit one and ask themselves if they would want to live there. 
‘Cutting off our nose’
Multiple Olmstead advisory members and families have also pushed back on Green, with many questioning whether the calculated nursing facility rate the state is using is accurate.
For instance, Kierstin Reed, president and CEO of LeadingAge Nebraska, which represents nursing homes and assisted living facilities, told Green that institutions have a variety of payment rates based on the complexity of need. She told Green she would “guarantee” most would exceed $162,000, if not well more with some daily rates of $1,000.
Reed told Green the $92,000 limit would count for “bare minimum,” “custodial-level care,” not the care needed for AD Waiver participants. She told him the waiver changes are a “choice.”
“We’re cutting off our nose to spite our face,” Reed told the Nebraska Examiner.

Nebraska also has a workforce problem, Reed said, and some facilities can’t support the needs of all patients, either. Some Nebraskans don’t have a nursing home within 100 miles, let alone bed openings in one that accepts Medicaid residents. Reed said families also know their loved ones’ needs.
“They have the intuition to know what the routine is and what things need to look like and what their loved one needs and what every sound or every movement might mean,” Reed said.
Wohlers, whose family lives north of Crawford, said there is a day center in Chadron, almost 30 miles away, which was a “clear no” for Michaela.
“Not being able to talk doesn’t mean you don’t have thoughts or things you want to say or things you want to express,” Wohlers said. “It just means it’s harder for you to do so.”

Reed also expressed concerns that many AD Waiver recipients will still need the same level of care they are receiving now, which exceeds the state’s proposed hourly limits, and that family caregivers won’t have time to work to make up for the income lost to the new caps.
Keyzer is one of many families who worry whether they could get another job to fill the gap while still providing the same level of care their loved ones need. Many said they also worry about relying on strangers for care.
Green, responding to Reed, said “there’s not a clean way” to know how many families are above the proposed 70-hour limit. He said limiting families to 40 hours is “common” in other states.
‘Budgets are balanced on our backs’
Alana Schriver, executive director of the Nebraska Association of Service Providers, said many service coordinators are not aware of the changes being proposed for services that are a “lifeline” for many families. She said the timing seems intentional to seek public comment over the holidays, when families and advocates might be distracted or short on time.

Schriver said human lives are “more important than any dollar bill” and that anyone might need the AD Waiver one day. She placed blame for tight budget times on Gov. Jim Pillen for signing significant income tax breaks in 2023.
“Tax breaks for the wealthy should not come on the backs of the aging and disabled,” Schriver said.
Thomas said Nebraskans with disabilities are taxpayers, and she lives a “typical life” where she picks up her grandson five days a week and watches him at home while his parents work. But Nebraskans with disabilities are “at the bottom of the list.”
“Once again, budgets are balanced on our backs,” Thomas said. “I thought we were moving beyond that, but we’re not.”

Keyzer echoed those concerns and suggested DHHS fundraise or try to ask for additional state dollars. Green did not answer Keyzer when she asked if DHHS tried to seek additional funding, and Powell did not answer when the Examiner asked. 
“Is this really the way to produce funds?” Keyzer asked. “To scare us all, right before the holidays, and tell us we have to figure out how to survive without incomes and still take care of our kid? I don’t know how to do that.”
While the changes are still in the proposal stage, some families said they’ve been told their hours will be cut Jan. 1. Green sidestepped a mother when she asked him at the Olmstead meeting. Powell said no changes would occur until July 1.
‘Paying grandmas to be grandmas’
Pillen signed significant income tax cuts during his first year in office, in 2023, for anyone making more than $18,000. Since then, he has faced significant budget challenges, which also complicated his plans for additional property tax relief, moving his proposals toward a shift from broadened or increased sales taxes.
Speaking with the Examiner ahead of the 2026 session, 69-year-old Pillen, who turns 70 in one week, said he’s old enough to remember when neighbors took care of one another and “government was not in this stuff.”
“I’m 100% to take care of the most vulnerable,” Pillen said. “But, I mean, the hardcore reality, we the people in Nebraska, in instances, are paying grandmas to be grandmas.”

Pillen said he has to ensure there’s accountability and not “waste and abuse.” He said DHHS had written $300,000 checks so Nebraskans aged 98 to 100 could stay at home, which he said “sure as hell” ought to be the exception, not the norm.
According to DHHS data, it’s unclear how many situations Pillen described have occurred. Powell said 95% of AD Waiver recipients already receive services “at or below the proposed budget limit” based on the nursing home rate. Green and Powell said 255 participants exceed the proposed cap of about $162,000, which is 175% of the nursing home rate. 
Reed and Schriver said the high costs are for the most medically needy Nebraskans. Thomas added that 255 people might not seem like a “big deal,” but “it is if you’re that person.”
‘Hope that they listen’
A couple of Olmstead Committee members asked Green why he didn’t bring the proposal to the advisory group sooner, to which Green said he disagrees that the changes affect waiver access.
“Access to the waivers is still here, and preferred,” Green said.
State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue is one of a handful of lawmakers watching the changes. He said he is and will remain “deeply engaged” and feels he is a voice, as he understands on a personal level how services and changes can impact a home. 
His oldest of three children, 37-year-old Isaac, was diagnosed at age 4 with Fragile X syndrome, an inherited genetic disorder that affects the X chromosome. 
“We have had tremendous people walk with us in the special needs arena,” he said. “I fight hard for special education and for the disabled community because I know what the needs are.”

Of possible waiver changes, he said that he has been digesting and trying to discern what it all means. He said he is eager to hear organizations and others weigh in by Jan. 5. He knows changes could impact many and that some could face possibly devastating decisions of sending their loved one to a care facility. 
His son lives with the family and attends day services at Duet in Bellevue, a community-based provider for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities.
“Any time you have a restriction or a reduction in services, there is going to be a negative impact,” Rountree said. For people who require around-the-clock care, he said the changes “will be detrimental, almost destructive.”
DHHS plans to submit the state’s waiver renewal request to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in early 2026. DHHS anticipates savings after, but Powell repeatedly declined to give current agency estimates, citing the possibility that the proposal could change.
“I really, truly hope that they listen to us family members, as caregivers, as taxpayers, that our opinion truly counts,” Wohlers said, “because we are what the State of Nebraska is about.”

(Photo by Eli Voorhies for Washington State Standard)U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declared a public health emergency Wednesday over this month’s flooding in Washington state. 
The action from Kennedy, the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is focused on helping meet the needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. As part of that, his agency is providing access to HHS emPOWER, which gives data on the number of Medicare enrollees reliant on medical equipment dependent on electricity and other health care services that could make them especially vulnerable to a disaster.
The announcement could be a good sign for the state’s chances of getting a major disaster declaration from President Donald Trump to potentially open up tens of millions of dollars to deal with the flooding’s aftermath. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson plans to ask for such a declaration in the coming weeks.
The flooding from heavy rain and overflowing rivers forced thousands of evacuations, breached multiple levees and damaged numerous highways. It still didn’t quite reach the levels some forecasts predicted. One person has been reported dead.
Kennedy’s order follows an emergency declaration from Trump that unlocked federal resources to respond to the storm. 
John Knox, of the department’s Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, said in a statement that, “HHS stands ready to assist state and local response efforts in the state of Washington due to the potential health care impacts from severe storms.” 
Health and Human Services has also waived penalties for violating federal health privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, for hospitals. 
“With today’s declaration and waiver, HHS is helping ensure that residents in the storm’s path have continuous access to the care they need during and after this storm,” Knox said. “ASPR’s highly trained personnel are prepared to support state and local actions to save lives and protect the delivery of health care services.”
The federal Disaster Distress Helpline is also available for crisis counseling. The multilingual hotline, open 24 hours a day, can be reached via call or text at 1-800-985-5990. 
The declaration is retroactive to Dec. 9. 
A windstorm forecast to arrive in western Washington on Wednesday could exacerbate problems, as saturated soil from the recent rain could make trees and powerline poles especially susceptible to falling over. But the wind is now not expected to be as intense as predicted earlier this week.

As new legal battles challenge President Donald Trump’s National Guard troop deployments in U.S. cities, Vermonters have been amping up efforts to express their public opposition.
From handing out flyers at the Vermont National Guard headquarters in Colchester to meeting monthly to discuss local efforts, a small group of residents said they are finding growing interest and solidarity to the cause of fighting what they call fascism.
On a recent Sunday afternoon, about 25 people showed up at the Fletcher Free Library in downtown Burlington to learn about a “Do Not Turn On Us” effort to connect with military personnel about their right to disobey illegal orders.

Rachel Siegel, one of the eight or so organizers, said the event sprouted from a national community effort involving a handful of people from different states earlier this year, including one from Vermont. 
Before they knew it, they had set up a mailing list, organized emails and began to help coordinate groups across the county.
“It was just a tremendous amount of stuff for a group of people that are not an organization and have no infrastructure. We had no staff. We didn’t have a comms person,” she said.
Siegel said she also distributed flyers on Labor Day at the Air National Guard’s open house in Colchester, reminding the Guard of its duty to “protect and assist Vermont communities” during emergencies. That spurred enough public interest for the local activists to host monthly meetings to discuss different kinds of local actions, she said.
A former city councilor in Burlington and former director of the Peace and Justice Center, Siegel has participated in many civil actions over the years opposing apartheid, F-35 fighter jets and policies of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.
She and her daughter were among 13 protesters who were arrested in 2018 as they blocked traffic while opposing family separations outside the ICE facility in Williston.
The flyering events outside the National Guard went very well this year, she said, with passing cars and members of the Guard willing to take flyers.
Joseph Brooks, a spokesman for the Vermont National Guard, said in an email that the residents handing out flyers exercised their First Amendment right “in an organized and respectful way.”
“We have had no incidents or altercations with anyone, and as result it fosters a productive dialogue. The fact that we can have such a dialogue is a testament to the strong relationship we have with the community and that our fellow Vermonters reflect back to us,” Brooks wrote.
Colchester resident Sherri Wormser said she heard about the event and joined because she thinks Vermonters need to present an organized front to prevent illegal military deployments in America or abroad.
“It’s still very important for all of us to speak up against the injustices that are occurring here and in bigger cities as well. But I’m also concerned that if it’s not stopped, that smaller and smaller towns are going to have the presence of the National Guard,” she said.
She said they plan to meet over the weekend “for ongoing resistance and flyering.”
Residents were dismayed last week when the Vermont Air National Guard was deployed to the Caribbean, reportedly in support of Trump’s military escalation against Venezuela. 
Siegel said she found the deployment “abhorrent” and was concerned about young adults heading into a potentially violent situation during the holiday season.
“I hope that they know their legal rights. We will continue to do what we can to connect with families and friends so that they can share our message to follow their oath and not obey illegal orders,” she said.
Wormser said it is “horrifying” for young troops to have to risk their lives abroad for a mission not authorized by Congress.
“We cannot forget the human aspect of all this. Our neighbors may be asked to kill somebody’s neighbors 2,000 miles away,” she said.
While he wasn’t one of the original organizers, Gordon Clark of Burlington said he is glad to be part of the local activism effort.
“We’re currently a small group of Vermont citizens who are shocked and appalled by what is going on in our country these days on many different fronts, but on one in particular: the use of our National Guard … being sent to other American cities and unconstitutional orders and whatnot. So we started an effort,” he said.
He learned of the group by word of mouth and said he hopes more people learn about the opposition effort and join them. 
“I would ask [Gov. Phil] Scott what he is doing about the deployment of the Vermont Air Guard to an apparent forward area of an unsanctioned war in the Caribbean,” he said.
The activists’ latest effort — a petition — went live on Dec. 1. It calls on Scott to oppose the deployment of the Vermont National Guard to American cities, against American citizens, and in unauthorized military actions abroad. It has 123 signatures as of Wednesday with several comments from Vermont residents who have signed it.
The organizers plan to send the petition to Scott when they have a substantial number of names, said Clark, who has also collected more than 60 signatures on a paper petition he is circulating.
Siegel said the local group has not yet come up with a name, but keeping people engaged in small actions feels motivating “because we know that fascism is, in part, fueled by people giving up hope.”
“If we, the people, can do a small thing. If they can create a petition. If they can sign a petition. If they can show up at an open house and hand out flyers. If they can make a flyer,” she said. “Any of these small things that keep people engaged and active will help people continue to do more things like that and help us resist and stop all authoritarianism.”

Nguyen told Commerce employees on Tuesday that he is leaving but didn’t disclose his new job. He said he didn’t anticipate taking off “until sometime in January.”
“Although I can’t tell you where I’m going just yet, I will be working in Seattle, closer to home,” he wrote in an agencywide email. “Sometimes opportunity knocks, even when you haven’t invited anyone to your door. Recently I was offered an opportunity outside of Commerce that I have accepted because it was the right thing to do for my family.”
The chamber, an independent business organization with 2,600 members, plans an announcement Monday concerning its chief executive officer position. A spokesperson declined further comment.
Rumors of Nguyen’s selection had begun circulating online and among business lobbyists in recent days. Nguyen did not return multiple phone calls for comment.
The job has been open since Rachel Smith left as the organization’s president and CEO to become president of the Washington Roundtable.
Nguyen, a White Center Democrat, was in his second term in the state Senate representing the 34th Legislative District when Gov. Bob Ferguson named him to the high-ranking post. He is the first member of Ferguson’s executive cabinet to quit, though others have retired. 
Nguyen led an agency with a $7.9 billion budget and that administers more than 100 programs in the areas of housing, energy, community and economic development, local government and business services. One of its largest portfolios is promoting development of affordable housing, a top priority of Ferguson’s.
In his email to employees, Nguyen wrote he was “honored” that Ferguson “put his faith in me nearly a year ago and I thank him for that trust.” He said he did not know if Ferguson would install an interim leader or hire a new director right away.
In a statement, Ferguson praised the outgoing director and didn’t say how he plans to replace him.
“I spoke with Joe, and it’s clear he received an offer he couldn’t refuse,” Ferguson said. “I deeply appreciate Joe’s work this past year.

[…]","A black-capped chickadee is seen in Anchorage on November 19, 2020. (Photo by Lisa Hupp/USFWS)It took me decades to really notice birds, to give them my full attention. When I did finally invite them into my life at age 43, I fell deeply—and some friends might add, madly—in love with our winged and feathered neighbors, especially the little ones that swarm backyard feeders throughout Alaska’s long and harsh winters.
At the heart of my late-in-life love affair with birds are black-capped chickadees, which first gained my attention more than sixty years ago, when I lived along the edge of rural Connecticut. Like other common New England birds, they quickly faded into the background of my world, for as a boy I was drawn to more exotic creatures: snakes and salamanders, frogs and turtles and trout.
My general disinterest in birds lasted more than four decades, until I settled in the foothills along Anchorage’s eastern edge.
On what’s known to locals as the Hillside, all manner of things began to grab my attention in new ways: the Chinook winds that rush and sometimes roar through the Chugach Mountains and down into the Anchorage Bowl; the winter commutes of ravens, which daily fly between their nighttime roosts in the mountains and the scavenging-rich environs of downtown and mid-town Anchorage; the spruce bark beetle and its infestation of local forests in the 1990s. But nothing grabbed me as deeply as the chickadees. They transformed my world, showed me some of what I’d been missing. In a way, they became my teachers.
“Something strange has happened,” reads one of my earliest Hillside journal entries, in December of 1993. “Something strange and magical and delightful. I’ve fallen under the spell of tiny forest creatures that rarely gained my attention in past years.”
My enchantment began on a Saturday morning, shortly before the winter solstice. Lolling in bed, I happened to glance outside. In the wooded backyard, several black-capped chickadees fluttered around a backyard spruce.
“Wonderful,” I thought. “Here’s a chance to meet some of my new neighbors.”
Inspired by their presence, and on something of a whim, I put an old, slightly bent baking pan on the back deck railing and piled on some sunflower seeds. Nothing happened that first day. But on Sunday, while seated at the dining room table, I watched a small feathered being land on the pan. It had a black-capped head and bib, white cheeks, a whitish beige belly and gray-streaked wings.
The chickadee grabbed a seed and zoomed off to a nearby tree. Then, in flashed another. And a third. For each, the routine was similar: dart in, look around, peck at the tray, grab a seed, look around some more and dart back out. Nervous little creatures, full of bright energy, they soon had me laughing at their antics. By the time they moved on, I sensed an all-too-rare upwelling of fascination and delight.
Within days, a whole new world opened up as woodland neighbors I’d never known, or even imagined, joined the black caps at my feeders: red-breasted nuthatches, common redpolls, pine grosbeaks, and pine siskins. What’s remarkable is that all of those species were—and are—common residents of the Anchorage area. Yet in prior days and years, I had no idea.
My newfound interest in birds grew quickly, surprising even me. What started as mere curiosity quickly bloomed into a consuming passion. I roamed bookstores in search of birding guidebooks, spontaneously exchanged bird descriptions with a stranger and purchased 50-pound bags of sunflower seeds.
All of this seemed very strange to a middle-aged guy who’d never been intrigued by birds — except for charismatic raptors — and had previously judged bird watchers to be rather odd sorts. I didn’t know what it meant, except that a door had opened. And I passed through.
My interest soon expanded outward from my feeders to the local landscape’s forests, coastal flats and tundra, and then even farther beyond, to Alaska’s far reaches. Suddenly, songbirds seemed to be everywhere. Where had they been hiding all those years? Of course they hadn’t been hiding at all. I simply hadn’t cared enough to notice them.
Helped along by local experts, I’ve gradually learned to recognize the songs, calls, and markings of dozens of species. But my favorites remain the songbirds that stay here year-round, adding bright voices and lively energy to our largely dormant winter landscape.
And among those birds, black caps have a special place at the top of my affections, partly for this reason: They’ve reminded me how my world can expand when I make the effort to pay attention. What else awaits me in our world, I wonder, that I haven’t yet discovered or noticed?

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-24 20:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT teen released by ICE marks first success story of new pro bono attorney coalition,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/24/ct-pro-bono-attorney-immigratio-ice/,The American Immigrant Legal Clinic offers services pro bono to immigrants who cannot afford legal representation.,"Advocates, attorneys, politicians and members of Meriden’s community gathered on Wednesday to celebrate the return of Kevin, a 16-year-old immigrant who had been detained in a federal detention facility for six months in Texas before his recent release. 
An attorney who worked on Kevin’s case said he saw the case as the first success in a much larger effort to provide legal representation to immigrants who are at risk of deportation by the federal government. 
Glenn Formica, a Connecticut-based immigration attorney, with support from the organization Connecticut Students for a Dream, has been bringing together lawyers and legal service organizations with different specialties to offer their services pro bono to immigrants who cannot afford to hire legal representation. They call the project The American Immigrant Legal Clinic, or TAILC. 
Formica said that during the first Trump administration, he’d been representing “crazy numbers” of immigration cases. In 2020, he said, he was representing 140 pro bono cases in his private practice.
“This time around, I needed something different,” he said. 
In the past, he’d done some work with community groups, trying to teach people about “red folders” and “blue folders” — methods for organizing the documents they would need if they were detained by ICE, Formica said. Red folders contain documents regarding employment and familial ties that can help persuade a court that the person is not a flight risk and should not be held on bond. Blue folders contain documents that make a legal case for the person to remain in the U.S. 
But this time, Formica wanted to go further. 
“I want the community to stop being lambs and I want them to be wolves, and I want them to learn what they need to learn to go hire lawyers and manage lawyers,” he said. 
Formica said the organization, which now includes 20 lawyers, was planning to open a clinic in New Haven in January, where people could bring the documents and have their cases transferred to panel attorneys and legal service organizations who could help.
Frances Bourliot, a partner with the legal firm Gonzalez Olivieri in Texas, who also assisted with Kevin’s case, said the new American Immigrant Legal Clinic was meant to fill a void that existed in the immigration system.
“Too many people in our community never get a real chance to be heard — not because of any judgment on the merits of their case, really, just because they don’t have access to legal support where it matters the most,” said Bourliot. 
Bourliot said the clinic also works with communities to teach them about what documents they might need and how to navigate the court system. 
“Organization in the beginning can be the difference between chaos and clarity,” she said. 
Maegan Faitsch, an attorney with Connecticut Legal Services, said she got connected to Kevin’s case after receiving a call from the pastor of St. Rose of Lima Church in Meriden, a church with a large immigrant congregation. 
Kevin, whose last name has been withheld out of concern for his safety, and his father were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after a routine immigration check-in in Hartford in June, shortly before Kevin was set to graduate from Maloney High School.
The two were transferred to Texas. Kevin’s father was deported. Kevin was transferred to a detention facility for children run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, where he remained for six months.
Faitsch said ICE attempted to deport Kevin twice, once in the middle of the night. According to Faitsch, ICE had granted Kevin a single phone call before his departure, which he used to call her. She said she was able to stop Kevin’s removal from the U.S. 
ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Kevin’s lawyers connected with Bourliot in Texas and with Rep. Matt Blumenthal, D-Stamford, who works with the firm Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder. Blumenthal filed a petition in U.S. federal district court for Kevin’s release. The federal government decided to release him after that, they said.  
“I think sometimes putting the pressure on the government and letting them know that there are people out there who care about these kids, who are looking at what’s happening and who are there ready to fight for them and to protect their rights — It seems to be working for now,” said Bourliot. 
Kevin told reporters in Spanish that conditions in the detention facility weren’t bad, but that they had little communication with family members. He said he spent his days reading or looking for things to do. He said that the other young people in the facility were often under stress, having taken risks to leave their countries of origin, and having no knowledge of what had happened to the family members with whom they had arrived in the U.S. Some of them, he said, had been in the facility for a long time, and the experience had taken a toll on their mental health. 
“It’s very hard to go through this process, and I’ve seen a lot of people that have had a hard time because of it,” he told the crowd gathered on Wednesday. “It’s not easy and we’re all human and we shouldn’t be treated like this.” 
Kevin said he still misses his father, with whom he was close. Andrea Sanchez, an executive consultant for CT Students for a Dream, said the organization planned to help Kevin access college when he is ready. 
His immigration case is still ongoing, and Formica said the attorneys planned to request Special Immigrant Juvenile Status for Kevin, which, if granted, would give him the ability to remain in the U.S.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0738-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 15:57:22.747249

The most current version was updated on Dec. 19, 2025 (Courtesy Montana DPHHS). RiverStone Health, the public health department of state’s largest county, Yellowstone, has confirmed the first death of influenza in the state this season, as Montana statistics show that influenza cases are happening more rapidly than last year at this time.
The state’s most current published data goes through Dec. 19 and shows 1,238 cases so far.
RiverStone reported that an unvaccinated man in his 80s died two weeks ago. That was the state’s first confirmed flu death this winter.
But Yellowstone County is reporting a large uptick in influenza cases.
So far, there have been 584 reported cases and 25 hospitalizations. Both of those numbers mean that about half of the cases in state have been confined to Yellowstone County. Statewide, there have been 49 hospitalizations, according to the most current statistics.
A five-year average of flu in Montana shows that flu tends to be the most active during the last two weeks of the calendar year, but the 2024-2025 spike in Montana hit later, not peaking until March when the number of hospitalizations reached to nearly 120.
The trend for flu this year more closely resembles severe recent flu seasons, for example, 2023-2024, which saw 19,909 cases reported statewide. That included 907 hospitalizations and 44 deaths. Last year’s flu season was also notable: Fewer cases were reported, but the state reported a five-year high of 68 deaths due to the virus.
So far, 69% of the hospitalizations have been from people older than age 65, and more than 90% of those needing to be admitted were age 50 or older.
“Influenza may feel familiar, but it can be a severe and even life-threatening illness,” said Dr. Megan Littlefield, RiverStone chief medical officer. “It is important that everyone takes precautions to prevent spreading illness, especially to protect our vulnerable populations.”
 



 

	 More information about influenza 			



The flu spreads through coughing and sneezing with symptoms that can include high fever, chills, headaches, exhaustion, sore throat, cough and body aches.  It may take about one to four days after being exposed to the virus for symptoms to develop. Additionally, you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else one day before symptoms develop and up to five to seven days after becoming sick.
Everyday precautions can help stop the spread of influenza. Those measures include:

Getting vaccinated.
Wearing a mask or covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
Washing your hands often with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available.
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Avoiding close contact with sick people.
Staying home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or necessities.

If infected with influenza, prescription antiviral medication such as Tamiflu can decrease symptoms and help speed recovery. These medications are most effective if given within the first two days of symptoms and are recommended for those most at risk for serious complications: children less than 2, adults older than 65, and those with underlying lung disease, heart disease or other chronic medical conditions.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A unanimous five-judge panel of the Montana Supreme Court has rejected a request by youth plaintiffs who successfully argued that the state has a constitutional obligation to protect the climate to assume control over legal challenges to several of the laws passed by the 2025 Legislature.
The order, issued Tuesday, said that the Held v. Montana litigants had not been able to show that the Treasure State’s highest court needed to assume jurisdiction, nor had they established why a district court setting couldn’t address their concerns.
The Held group of plaintiffs successfully led a first-of-its-kind lawsuit that said that the Montana Constitutional guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment” obligated the state to adopt more protections for the climate and human health. That trial took place in a Lewis and Clark County District courtroom and the decision was later affirmed by the Montana Supreme Court.
Since then, the Legislature has modified some of the state’s environmental laws. However,  the Republican-led state House and Senate said that while the state must disclose “greenhouse gas” emissions for many projects, that data cannot be used to halt progress in mining or natural resources, an action the Held plaintiffs disagree with.
Other cases, including on the federal level, have had much less success because the environmental protection has so far been derived from the state’s Constitution, not necessarily federal law.
The Held litigants are more than a dozen people, including minors, who argued that the Montana Supreme Court should take up the matter because of the urgency of environmental degradation and because the lawsuit had implications statewide. They petitioned for a “writ of supervisory control,” which is an extraordinary measure used sparingly by the Supreme Court to assume control of cases that would normally be heard in district court.
The five-member panel said that the Held plaintiffs did not establish that the issues were so urgent that they could not be addressed by a district court. In fact, the court cited several examples of timely matters heard by lower level courts, and cases where the Supreme Court had declined to take cases.
“(The Held litigants) brought their petition seven months after the law took effect,” the Supreme Court opinion said.
They had used a finding from the original Held case, which said that every ton of greenhouse gases exacerbates their injuries as the basis of their appeal to the Supreme Court. However, the court rejected that argument.
“Although petitioners argue that the development of the factual record is unnecessary given the factual record in Held, they do not address why the district court would not be equipped to consider the legal issues in a timely fashion and permit them to present an appeal in the ordinary course,” the opinion said. “In fact, district courts entertain constitutional challenges routinely and have the tools to address allegations of irreparable harm or similar questions of urgency.”

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle) Federal officials have ordered a temporary halt to the planned shutdowns of two coal-burning Indiana power plants amid President Donald Trump’s attempts to boost the coal mining industry.
The U.S. Department of Energy orders issued Tuesday require Northern Indiana Public Service Co. and CenterPoint Energy to keep those generating plants operating despite their intentions of closing them this month.
The 90-day orders say the two coal-burning units set for closure at NIPSCO’s Schahfer Generating Station near Wheatfield and one at CenterPoint’s Culley Generating Station along the Ohio River near Newburgh must remain “available to operate” until at least March 23.
The orders come as Trump has pushed policies to promote the coal industry while deriding the shift toward solar and wind energy as sources of electricity.
The Energy Department said the Indiana plants orders were needed because the “reliable supply of power from these coal plants is essential for keeping the region’s electric grid stable.” Both orders cited the growing power demands of data centers among the reasons for keeping the plants in operation.
“Keeping these coal plants online has the potential to save lives and is just common sense,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. “Americans deserve reliable power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining during extreme winter conditions.”
The federal agency has issued similar orders for power plants in other states in recent months, including a large coal-burning station in Michigan.
Companies’ response
Indiana’s major utilities have over many years been shifting away from coal-powered plants toward using natural gas and renewable sources for electricity generation.
It was not immediately clear Wednesday how NIPSCO and Centerpoint would abide with the orders to keep the coal-burning plants in operations. 
Settlement: Duke to consider selling Indiana coal units amid switch to natural gas

NIPSCO, which has more than 450,000 electric customers across northern Indiana, said it would comply with the order and was “reviewing the overall impact to our customers and company.”
“We recognize the importance of both reliability and cost management for our customers, and we will continue to engage with federal, state and local stakeholders as we adapt to evolving regulatory requirements,” Vince Parisi, NIPSCO’s president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.
CenterPoint, which serves about 150,000 customers in the Evansville area, announced plans in 2023 to convert its last coal-burning unit at the Culley Generation Station to natural gas by 2027.
The company said its plans would reduce costs while preserving the Culley station’s generating capacity and adding solar and wind power sources in the coming years.
CenterPoint said Wednesday it would “continue to work collaboratively with our federal, state and local partners and remain focused on prioritizing affordability and energy security.”
“Working together, we will help contribute to regional electric reliability efforts to focus on what is most important — safe and reliable service for our customers and fellow Hoosiers during the upcoming winter months,” the company said in a statement.
The NIPSCO units set for closure generate about 850 megawatts of electricity and date to the 1980s, according to the federal orders. The CenterPoint unit generates about 100 megawatts and began operations in 1966.
Coal foes blast orders
Environmental groups and consumer advocates denounced the Energy Department orders, arguing they would force “households to pay more for coal’s deadly air and toxic water pollution.”
“The federal government’s order to force extremely expensive and unreliable coal units to stay open will result in higher bills for Hoosiers who are already reeling from record-high rate increases in 2025,” said Ben Inskeep, program director for the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana. “We can’t afford this costly and unfounded federal overreach.”
An analysis by the Citizens Action Coalition released in July of Indiana’s five investor-owned electric utilities found that residential bills spiked by 17.5% in one year, or $28 a month on average statewide.
Ashley Williams, executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana, called NIPSCO’s Schahfer plant “one of the most notorious polluters in the country.”
“On-site coal ash contamination of groundwater, along with a proposed massive gas plant and AI data center, compounds an extremely dire situation and creates an unconscionable environmental burden,” Williams said. “The Trump administration is trying to steal away our futures by keeping us tethered to the dirty coal energy of the past.”

This story is co-published by the Wrangell Sentinel and Northern Journal.
An Indigenous community is locked in a debate about the pros and cons of a major new mine on their traditional lands — and a big cash payment promised by the developer.
There is strong support, and fierce opposition. A lot of money to be made, and a wild river to protect. The community faces a pivotal choice.
Though this story sounds like it could be unfolding in rural Alaska, a version of it has actually been playing out just across the border with Canada, in northwest British Columbia. Still, it has implications for the Alaskans who live downstream from the proposed mine site.
In a referendum after weeks of heated debate, members of the Tahltan Nation earlier this month voted overwhelmingly to approve a deal with a Canadian mining company that hopes to revive a huge gold and silver mine, called Eskay Creek, which stopped producing in 2008. The project is located above the Unuk River, which flows into Alaska near Ketchikan.
The Tahltans’ backing is a major step forward for the project, and it comes as the Canada and B.C. governments intensify efforts to build more mines in the name of national security and economic growth. Several of the projects are near the border with Alaska, where state and federal elected officials are separately pushing mines that could help wean the U.S. off a foreign supply of minerals used in energy, electronics and weapons.
Just one day after the Tahltan vote, Canada’s federal government announced that it had approved a merger between two multinational mining firms with a condition that calls for advancing two other proposed mines in Tahltan territory. Both projects sit above tributaries of the Stikine River, a major, salmon-bearing waterway that straddles Canada and the U.S. and empties into the ocean near the small Southeast Alaska town of Wrangell.
Louie Wagner Jr., a Tsimshian and Tlingit resident of Metlakatla, a Native community at the southern tip of Alaska’s panhandle, said he’s concerned about the health of the Unuk River and its future with mines in its watershed.
Wagner and his family have fished and hunted moose along the Unuk for generations.
“That little river cannot handle it,” Wagner said in a recent phone interview. The Unuk is notable, he added, for its abundance of eulachon, a small, oily fish also known as hooligan that’s a staple for Indigenous communities in Southeast Alaska.
Though rarely discussed in Alaska circles, the Tahltan Nation’s approach to mining has major implications for the industry’s future in the transboundary region. A top U.S. Department of Interior official visited the region last year to learn more about models for how Indigenous nations can partner with mining companies.
There are more than a dozen early-stage mining projects in Tahltan territory, many above rivers that flow into Alaska. And the Eskay Creek vote could serve as a preview of future deals between the Tahltan government and the for-profit mining companies promoting development.
For months, members of the First Nation debated whether to approve a deal, known as an impact benefit agreement, that Tahltan elected leaders had negotiated with Vancouver-based Skeena Resources, the company pushing Eskay Creek.

The specifics of the agreement have not been made public. But Tahltan officials have said it guarantees benefits worth more than $1 billion over the life of the mine, mostly in cash but also in contracts and wages.
The deal also calls for an upfront payment from Skeena, intended to be distributed to individual Tahltan members — to the tune of $7,250 each, according to Tahltan officials. And the agreement reportedly gives the First Nation government some environmental oversight over the mine.
The nation backed the deal with support from more than 77% of the roughly 1,750 Tahltans who voted, according to the Tahltan Central Government. Payments are expected to go out to members in 2026.
“Tahltan Central Government is not standing on the sidelines,” Tahltan president Kerry Carlick said in a statement after the vote.  “We are embedding ourselves directly into the governance of environmental protection.”
Tahltan leaders have long worked to navigate political tensions between an expanding mining industry and efforts to protect traditional lands and wildlife.
The Tahltan government has entered into a number of agreements with mining companies. But it also has opposed efforts to mine coal and drill for natural gas near the headwaters of major rivers in the region.
And some Tahltan members have been outspoken critics of the Eskay Creek project and the company promoting it.
In the leadup to the recent vote, arguments erupted on social media, and relationships among community members grew strained, some Eskay Creek opponents said in interviews.
“This is causing internal conflicts,” said Tamara Quock, a Tahltan member who lives in northern B.C. some 350 miles east of the mine site.
Quock said she thinks the promise of the direct payments “enticed” some people to vote in favor of the agreement. Debate over the project, she added, grew more intense after that condition was added to the deal.
Quock said she feels Skeena is “using the Tahltan people” to generate its own profits.
She and other critics have voiced concerns about a perceived lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest within the First Nation’s government. They also say they are worried about possible environmental impacts from the project, which would involve digging two open pits and storing millions of tons of mining waste above the Unuk River.
Skeena didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Alaska Native leaders, fishermen and environmental advocates who live downstream, in Southeast Alaska, for years have expressed concerns about Eskay Creek and other proposed mines in the region, saying they don’t trust Canadian regulators to safeguard Alaskan interests.
“You can’t cut these watersheds in half and expect to adequately protect them,” said Guy Archibald, executive director of the tribally led Southeast Alaska Indigenous Transboundary Commission. “Right now they’re cutting the baby in half and ignoring the effects on the Alaska side of the border.”
The commission last month filed a legal challenge in B.C. court, asserting that regulators had failed to consult Alaska tribes on several proposed mines in the region, including Eskay Creek.
Meanwhile, after a major spill last year at a Canadian gold mine in the Yukon River watershed, Alaska’s congressional delegation called for more oversight of Canadian mines near transboundary rivers like the Unuk and Stikine. The statement from the delegation — which has strongly supported mine development in Alaska — called for “binding protections, financial assurances, and strong transboundary governance.”
“As British Columbia seeks to advance numerous mines just upstream from Alaska, we are still asking them to fully remediate legacy sites and firmly commit to binding protections for Alaska interests,” Joe Plesha, a spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, said in a recent statement. “Senator Murkowski is actively considering new ways to make our B.C. neighbors take Alaskans’ concerns seriously.”

Ottawa and B.C.’s provincial government, meanwhile, are funding new infrastructure projects and prioritizing permitting for energy and resource development projects, including Eskay Creek and the expansion of a huge copper and gold mine in the Stikine watershed, called Red Chris.
Canadian officials say existing regulations are geared to minimize impacts in the shared watersheds. Major projects undergo thorough environmental assessments before they’re approved, a spokesperson with the B.C. agency that leads those reviews, the Environmental Assessment Office, said in an email.
“Making sure large-scale projects are properly assessed is critical to making sure development is sustainable — to ensure good jobs and economic growth while also protecting the environment and wildlife, and keeping communities healthy and safe,” said the spokesperson, Sarah Plank.
Tahltan officials declined an interview request and did not respond to questions about Alaskans’ concerns or the First Nation’s agreement with Skeena.
Supporters of Eskay Creek say it could be transformational for the Tahltan Nation. Among proponents of the deal is Chad Norman Day, a former Tahltan president who has worked in the mining industry and now runs a consulting firm that does mining-related business.
“The benefits which flow to the Tahltan Nation from here will empower the people and territory unlike anything we have ever seen,” Day said in a statement after the vote.
Many Tahltan people work in mining, and the First Nation already generates revenue from Red Chris and another large operating mine, Brucejack, which started producing gold in 2017.
In 2019, Tahltan citizens voted in favor of an agreement with a different mining company pushing another, much bigger proposed mine partially in the Unuk watershed, called KSM. The outcome of that vote was nearly identical to the recent Eskay one, with about the same percentage in favor.
The first nation also, in the past five years, has entered into two joint decisionmaking agreements with the B.C. government for regulatory reviews of mining projects, including Eskay Creek.
Before it can start producing, Eskay Creek needs an environmental approval from the provincial government. A decision is expected early next year.

Farmers, researchers, the state and the federal government are trying to fight the infestation, but it’s a never-ending battle for landowners.","John Parker Campbell describes the wild pigs on his family farm as “a constant headache.” 
Hogs will eat up corn and peanuts that have just been planted, damaging acres of crops in a night. Some years the hog damage is worse than others but it has been a problem since his father started farming in Copiah County in the 1990’s.
In Mississippi, wild hogs create around $60 million to $80 million in damage every year, including eating crops and damaging property. Farmers, researchers, the state and the federal government are trying to fight the infestation, but it’s a never-ending battle for landowners. 
“Farmers have enough stress as it is. They don’t need this modern-day locust,” said Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson
Campbell and his father use traps and have an electric fence around their property to keep the hogs out. The fence has been effective, although the feral pigs have broken through parts of it before. However, it was expensive to initially put up and costs thousands of dollars each year to maintain. 
“You have to know that they’re out there,” said Campbell. “We keep an eye on our fields but you can get busy and then go a couple days without looking and they can just do a tremendous amount of damage.” 
The wild hog population has grown over the past 40 years, not just in Mississippi, but across the United States. In the 1980’s they lived in 17 states, now they can be found in 35. Previously, it was thought they cost the U.S. $2 billion a year but new research indicates that number is actually over $3 billion. 
Wild pigs are not native to the United States. The first population was escaped livestock brought to the Americas by European settlers. Later, Eurasian boars were imported for hunting and joined the wild hog population. With no natural predators and plenty of land, water and food, their numbers have grown.

While some owners successfully deterred pigs by using electric fences, the only way to manage the larger population is by killing the hogs.
Mississippi was the first state to launch a statewide wild hog-control program in 2020. The program provides education and traps to landowners.
The program operates with a budget of $183,000 a year which mainly goes to staff salaries and maintenance of smart traps and cameras. The program has four application cycles with each cycle receiving between 35 and 40 applications.
There are a number of ways to reduce the pig population, including using traps, aerial gunning and poison. While wild hogs are considered nuisance animals and can be hunted year round, hunting is relatively ineffective at controlling the larger population. 
Aerial gunning in Mississippi is only used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It also has limited use as the pigs can easily run into the trees for cover, whereas in places like Texas, there is more open and flat land. While there is ongoing research into the use of poisons, including contraceptives, it’s challenging to make sure that other animals don’t eat them.
Trapping is one of the most common methods and is preferred as it requires less time and effort than other methods. A new study from Mississippi State University looked at the economic benefits of trapping.
The average landowner in the study had an estimated $20,000 in hog damages per year. It showed that reducing a local pig population can lead to less damage and $300-$4,000 in savings per pig the next year for land owners. But combatting the wild hog problem is an expensive and constant battle. 
The study involved intense, dedicated hog removal through Delta Wildlife, a conservation nonprofit. 
Jody Acosta, Delta Wildlife’s nuisance-and invasive-species program manager, and his team set up and monitor traps around the Delta. While the team is experienced and knowledgeable, Acosta is clear that the job is not about the glory of hunting but about pest management.

Some of the trap doors will only close when a Delta Wildlife team member remotely pushes a button. So they work around the clock, often late at night, checking the live video feed of the traps. Once they successfully trap a group of pigs, a Delta Wildlife worker quickly makes their way to the trap so they can dispose of the pigs and reset the trap.
The study estimates that it would cost a land owner about $200 per pig if they outsourced every part of trapping. Strickland, one of the study’s authors, acknowledges that “it’s absolutely a big number” but says that the average landowner would likely pay less. Despite the initial sticker shock, Strickland said the study shows that pig removal results in a “positive return on investment” and that government programs are economically viable. 
Long term, Strickland thinks it’s possible to reduce the wild pig population through a concerted effort and investment. He urges farmers and landowners to take wild pigs seriously even if there’s only a few on their property at the moment.
“The problem will only get worse and worse,” said Strickland.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09131825/Wild-Hog.jpg,,,2025-12-24 15:12:07.269728

(Photo via State Library and Archives of Florida Postcard Collection)University of Central Florida researchers using genetic information say that, with intervention, depleted flamingo populations in Florida can recover. 
A study led by biology graduate student Jessica Folsom used genomic data in determining the flamingo population and its genetics in Florida and proposes strategies to restore the population. 
Researchers found that flamingos in Florida and around the Caribbean display few genetic differences, including those held in captivity. 
Flamingos in Florida often fly in for a few months, but building a long-term breeding population would pose a challenge. 
“For more than a century, there were almost no conservation measures for flamingos in the U.S.,” said Steven Whitfield, a co-author of the study and a director at the Audubon Nature Institute. “That’s partly because flamingos were long considered a non-native species to Florida. With our work, we want to show they have always belonged here and there’s a scientific basis to support their recovery.”
According to the research, the long-term outlook for flamingos is “good,” but the existing population is not sufficient for recovery. “Moreover, habitat destruction, pollution and warming temperatures add to the challenges they face.”
“Natural recovery of the flamingo is unlikely in Florida without intervention,” Whitfield said in a news release. “But our study shifts that conversation. We can now confidently say ex-situ [managed in zoos or aquariums] flamingos are genetically compatible with wild populations, which opens possibilities for a future release program, even though logistical hurdles remain.”
Reintroduction, although, must be guided by policy, the researchers said. 
Lawmakers, for at least five years, have proposed replacing the mockingbird with the flamingo as the state bird.
In advance of this coming session, SB 150, filed by Sen. Gayle Harrell, a Republican from Stuart, passed the Environment and Natural Resources committee unanimously last month and has two more committees dates.
HB 11, an identical bill filed in the House by Republican Reps. Jim Mooney from Islamorada and Chip LeMarca from Lighthouse Point, passed the Natural Resources & Disasters subcommittee last month and has two more committees to pass.
Those bills would designate the scrub-jay as the state songbird, too.
“The flamingo is iconic to Florida. When I was growing up it was flamingos and palm trees. … But the awareness really comes with the conservation. The flamingo is now thriving in Florida,” Mooney said during a December House committee meeting.

Extirpation
Hunting and habitat loss during the 1800s resulted in extirpation of Florida’s flamingos by the early 1900s. Since then, the bird has shown “only faint signs of a true comeback,” according to the research. 
“Despite high vagility and the presence of nearby flocks in the Caribbean, the Florida population has yet to show substantial recovery,” the report says. 
“The ex-situ [managed] population had higher diversity compared to wild birds and were not significantly differentiated from the wild population, making these flocks possible sources for reintroduction projects,” the study says.
Flamingo representation is common in Florida, being displayed, for example, on state lottery branding and a ginormous piece of art in the Tampa airport.
“As a native Floridian who grew up in Tallahassee, Florida, I was fascinated and a little surprised to see the flamingo as a prominent state icon, yet I had never seen one in the wild,” said Folsom, the researcher who led the study. 
Hoffman said that zoo flocks, including Zoo Miami’s, were founded after a Hialeah horse racetrack owner released about 20 flamingos in the wild in the 1920s to boost his business.

Flamingos are protected by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service List of Birds Protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 2023. That law makes it illegal to hunt, kill, sell, export, or transport any migratory bird without a permit from the federal government.
The study was published in the American Ornithological Society’s Ornithological Applications journal. 
According to a 2024 Audubon Florida report, “Our iconic American Flamingos blown in from Hurricane Idalia in 2023 continue to remain in Everglades National Park thanks to available forage and quality habitat — a bright pink indicator of the success of our Everglades conservation efforts.”
An Audubon survey found 101 wild American Flamingos in Florida in February 2024, nearly half in Florida Bay.
“Flamingos were historically numerous in Florida until the 19th century plume trade — when an ounce of feathers was worth more than gold — decimated wading birds in South Florida,” the Audubon report states.
“Even after legislation and Audubon wardens protected these birds, extensive draining and ditching of the Everglades destroyed their habitat. Now that restoration momentum is flowing in the River of Grass, we are hopeful that protected wetlands and improved water flow will create enough habitat resources for the Hurricane Idalia flamingos to survive and thrive here.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC15095-1024x645.jpg,,,2025-12-24 14:58:24.551980

Laura Kelly approached the final year of her second term with a familiar plea that the Kansas Legislature pass a reasonable budget and a bleak realization the state wouldn’t be able to compensate for federal reductions in spending on health care and food programs.
The bell tolls 2 p.m. Jan. 12 on the annual legislative session in Kansas with the term-limited Democratic governor and a Republican supermajority in the House and Senate. As Kelly moved closer to departing the office, Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, would continue his campaign for governor and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, would be occupied with a campaign for state insurance commissioner.
Kelly, scheduled to deliver the State of the State address on Jan. 13, said developing a budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 would be her primary quest.
“No. 1 is always the budget,” she said in an interview with Kansas Reflector. “That the Legislature pass a balanced, reasonable, sane budget that funds the important responsibilities of state government.”
Kelly said it wasn’t possible for the state to fill in for slashed federal appropriations to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
“We are not really taking that approach. That’s the way we’ve been since these cuts started coming down,” the governor said. “One, we don’t really have the money. Where do you stop on those kinds of things? Can we backfill the cuts to Medicaid that are coming? Absolutely not. SNAP? We cannot.”
The U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee estimated the “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed by President Donald Trump would eventually strip Medicaid coverage from 90,000 Kansans, place rural hospitals across Kansas at greater risk and prompt Affordable Care Act premium increases. Changes to the ACA compel higher personal insurance premiums after Dec. 31, but Medicaid cuts would be staggered during 2026, 2027 and 2028.
Overall, Kelly said, Kansas could lose least $150 million through federal reductions to health care programs.
The federal government has funded about two-thirds of the annual cost of Medicaid in Kansas, and covered all but administrative expenditures for emergency food aid under SNAP.
“Kansas is not alone,” Kelly said. “These programs like SNAP and Medicaid were really built on the premise of a partnership.”
Kelly said another objective was to sustain the push for economic development. The state’s commitment to financially support relocation of the Kansas City Chiefs to a stadium in Wyandotte County and a headquarters in Johnson County was a “game-changer for our state,” she said.
The governor said the process of recruiting the NFL franchise was an example of what Republicans and Democrats at the local and state levels could accomplish through collaboration. Masterson and Hawkins, as well as Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, D-Lenexa, and House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Kelly and Lt. Gov. David Toland for the announcement Monday in Topeka.
“You don’t often see this type of bipartisanship in our politics today, but that’s how we do things in Kansas, especially when the stakes are high,” Kelly said.
In the 2026 session, Kelly said she also would focus on finalizing a long-term plan for preserving and enhancing the state’s water resources.
“We are on the cusp of coming up with that strategic plan that I’d like to see in place before I’m out of office,” Kelly said. “As I’ve said before, I don’t expect to solve the water problem by the time I leave, but I would like in place a structure and a funding source that will insure that we can address water.”
In addition, the governor said she was committed to standing up the new state Office of Early Childhood by July 1. The goals would be consolidation of programs housed in a cluster of state agencies and the upgrading of services beneficial to children.
“We will spend and invest a lot of energy to make sure,” Kelly said. “Part of the point of the Office of Early Childhood is to be more efficient, so I’m hoping that we won’t be looking at needing money.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC160871-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 13:58:06.949556

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)A federal judge’s ruling in favor of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and other Democratic state officials temporarily blocks the Trump administration from abruptly withdrawing federal money from housing programs for the homeless.
“More than $21 million in unlawfully held funds will now be processed for housing efforts in the commonwealth, supporting veterans, seniors, families with children and individuals with disabilities,” said a news release from Beshear’s office. 
Many Kentuckians at risk of returning to homelessness because of federal funding switch

Beshear said he was “thankful that today’s ruling will protect housing for 700 households and 1,200 Kentuckians.”
U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy of Rhode Island granted the preliminary injunction against a decision announced last month by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to shift billions in funding in the Continuum of Care program from permanent housing to temporary transitional housing.
Beshear’s office said the HUD changes would have capped funding to states for permanent supportive housing at 30% and required states to reapply for money previously approved by Congress and awarded in 2024. Now, that funding will be processed without the need to reapply, the news release says.
Kentucky was at risk of losing 70% of the more than $15 million currently approved that supports permanent supportive housing in 118 of the state’s 120 counties. The cap would have also negatively impacted more than $20 million in federal funding for rental assistance and supportive assistance for homeless Kentuckians, said the governor’s office.
HUD’s funding priorities for alleviating homelessness and its response to the judge’s ruling remain unclear. The New York Times reports a HUD spokesman, asked about the legal developments, said the department was “committed to program reforms” and would proceed according to the law.
Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, said the preliminary court order “provides legal clarity as the case moves forward as well as a directive to the federal government to honor its funding commitments made to communities, nonprofit organizations, and households in 2024. 
“The preliminary injunction should begin to provide some relief from the unnecessary disruption we have experienced since the government reopened in November. We look forward to seeing the administration’s update on renewal processing on December 30, and we hope that this gives families currently housed under the Continuum of Care program some peace of mind this holiday season.”
Earlier this month, HUD rescinded its Nov. 13 notice announcing the funding changes an hour before a court hearing on two lawsuits challenging the new policy, prompting McElroy, the federal judge,  to say, “It feels like intentional chaos.” 
The other states represented in the challenge are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, along with the District of Columbia.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1245806948-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 13:58:06.949556

Greg Gianforte has requested President Donald Trump issue an emergency declaration to respond to damage caused by high winds on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation.
“On December 17, 2025, a historic, long-duration high-wind event and associated blizzard caused widespread destruction across Montana,” Gianforte wrote in a letter.
He said the storm brought gusts from 60 to 90 mph and more than 100 mph in the mountains.
“Most critically, the storm caused structural failure of the roof of the water holding tank supplying the Fort Belknap Indian Community,” Gianforte wrote.
The request Wednesday for emergency federal assistance is the second this month following flooding in northwest Montana, a blizzard in northeast Montana and high winds across the state.
Friday, the governor announced that President Trump had approved the request for help from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for flooding in Lincoln and Sanders counties and the Blackfeet Nation.
In the news release Wednesday, Gianforte said damage from the recent storm exposed Fort Belknap’s primary water source to potential contaminants, necessitating a boil order for approximately 700 homes, a detention facility, a hospital, restaurants, and tribal offices.
In the letter, Gianforte said the unique demographic and geographic challenges make the impact on the Fort Belknap Indian Community especially dire.
“Many households in the community are multi-generational, housing a high concentration of vulnerable populations, including children and the elderly, who are at increased risk during a water crisis,” the letter said.
He said federal support is needed due to the severity and complexity of the emergency, and it would go toward repairing the water tank, securing reliable and safe drinking water, and alleviating the financial burden of the “unanticipated second disaster in two weeks.”
An estimate of the damages statewide related to recent disasters was not immediately available Wednesday from the Governor’s Office.
However, Trump’s approval of the earlier emergency declaration allows up to $5 million in federal funds to help with response measures, according to the Governor’s Office.
Gianforte said the recent wind and snow affected the entire state, with 43 of 56 counties recording gusts of 70 mph or greater, and in northeast Montana, a blizzard that lasted up to five hours.
“Federal support is essential to ensure the health and safety of the affected population,” Gianforte wrote.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos08-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 13:58:06.949556
,DC,2025-12-24 18:09:30+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,National Guard shooting case moved to federal court as prosecutors weigh death penalty,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/national-guard-shooting-case-moved-federal-court-prosecutors-weigh-death-penalty,,"WASHINGTON — The man accused of shooting two National Guard members near the White House last month, killing one, was charged in federal court Wednesday, moving the case out of the local court system.United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro wrote in a statement the “transfer of this case from Superior Court to District Court ensures that we can undertake the serious, deliberate, and weighty analysis required to determine if the death penalty is appropriate here.”West Virginia National Guard members Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, were shot while on patrol in Washington, D.C., the day before Thanksgiving. “Sarah Beckstrom was just 20 years old when she was killed and her parents are now forced to endure the holiday season without their daughter,” Pirro added. “Andrew Wolfe, by the grace of God, survived but has a long road ahead in his recovery.”Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, was already charged with first-degree murder while armed, assault with intent to kill while armed and two counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. The federal charges now also include transporting a firearm in interstate commerce with the intent to commit an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year and transporting a stolen firearm in interstate commerce.New details disclosedA seven-page document submitted to the court details Lakanwal’s movements ahead of the shooting, which took place just before Thanksgiving. But it doesn't shed any light on his possible motives.  A special agent with the FBI, whose name was redacted in the affidavit, wrote the .357 Smith & Wesson revolver used in the shooting was legally purchased by another person in Bellevue, Washington, in February 2008. But after that person, identified by the initials J.D., died in February 2023, the weapon was stolen. The affidavit alleges that Lakanwal obtained it from someone identified as W-1 after originally trying to purchase an AR-15, a compact AK-47-style stockless pistol and a pistol in October of this year. Lakanwal told this person that he believed he needed a weapon since he was driving for the ride-sharing services Lyft and Uber, according to the affidavit. The FBI agent, however, wrote that Lakanwal hadn’t driven for those services since May 25 and was unemployed when he sought the weapons. The person identified as W-1 in the affidavit was able to secure the .357 Smith & Wesson revolver and gave it to Lakanwal on Nov. 14. “W-1 explained that he gave the firearm to (Lakanwal) because he believed (Lakanwal) wanted it for personal protection while working as a rideshare driver. W-1 stated that W-1 was extremely nervous during the exchange and was visibly shaking,” the FBI agent wrote. “According to W-1, (Lakanwal) observed W-1’s nervousness and placed an arm around W-1 in an effort to calm him. W-1 stated that it is common knowledge among his peers that firearms acquired 'on the streets' are typically stolen firearms.”The revolver was loaded with five bullets at the time. Lakanwal went to a Big 5 Sporting Goods store the next day to purchase a box of ammunition. Route to D.C. trackedThe same day, Nov. 15, Lakanwal searched Google Maps for “Washington, D.C.” and “The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500,” according to the affidavit.The FBI agent wrote that Lakanwal’s Toyota Prius was in Washington state on Nov. 16, based on “license plate reader data that is made available to law enforcement through Customs and Border Protection.”The car was in Idaho on Nov. 19, Illinois on Nov. 21 and Washington, D.C., on Nov. 23. Day of shootingA few days later, on Nov. 26, Beckstrom and Wolfe were on patrol about two blocks from the White House when shot. Video footage from different locations near the shooting at 17th and I streets northwest showed Lakanwal “coming around the corner at the intersection with his hands raised in a firing stance.” He then “immediately began firing in the direction of Beckstrom and Wolfe, and they are both captured on video collapsing on the ground,” according to the FBI agent’s affidavit.

Two majors in the National Guard, identified as NG M-1 and NG M-2 in the affidavit, were talking with Beckstrom and Wolfe when the shooting happened. “NG M-1 reported that he heard gunshots; as he heard gunshots, he observed Beckstrom and Wolfe fall to the ground,” the FBI agent wrote. “NG M-1 then observed (Lakanwal), who was dressed in a knee-length, dark-colored jacket and armed with a revolver, (fired) additional shots. NG M-1 pulled his issued service weapon and fired shots at (Lakanwal). (Lakanwal) fell to the ground where he was detained by NG M-2.”The FBI agent wrote that both “Beckstrom and Wolfe were unresponsive and suffering from gunshot wounds to the head.”Beckstrom died as a result of her injuries at 5:58 p.m. the following day, Thanksgiving. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia charged Lakanwal with first-degree murder on Nov. 28, adding it to other criminal charges. Lakanwal pleaded not guilty in DC Superior Court during an arraignment on Dec. 2 and was denied bond in the case. West Virginia Gov.

The Department of Public Safety sent troopers to Winner and Sturgis for the ninth set of patrols undertaken as part of Gov. Larry Rhoden’s “Operation Prairie Thunder” public safety initiative.
The city of Brookings posted a notice on Dec. 12 saying that troopers would be in the area Dec. 17-19 for a Prairie Thunder saturation patrol. The city would “not be participating” in the operation, the notice said.
State tallies $43,000 in trooper overtime costs during Operation Prairie Thunder

Gov. Larry Rhoden, who announced the initiative in July, chastised the city for the announcement, which coincided with a press release from the Highway Patrol on previous efforts in Huron and Belle Fourche.
“It’s unfortunate that the city of Brookings would jeopardize an anti-crime operation and put the safety of our officers at risk by publishing this information,” Rhoden said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight.
Operations in Huron had drawn concern from some members of that city’s Hispanic community when additional troopers came to town in November for the first of two saturation stops, inspiring several social media posts about what some believed to be federal immigration raids. 
The Highway Patrol signed cooperation agreements with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement in advance of launching Operation Prairie Thunder, which initially targeted the city of Sioux Falls and surrounding areas. In total, troopers have questioned 81 people about their immigration status since the operation’s launch, and 57 people have been detained on behalf of federal immigration agents. 
Prairie Thunder patrols have led to a total of 419 arrests, according to the Department of Public Safety, and 271 of those arrests involved drug charges.  
The state never confirmed or denied plans to visit Brookings. Rhoden’s statement last week also said the state could not discuss “operational specifics” on future saturation patrols. 
The state routinely announces saturation patrols and sobriety checkpoints in certain areas, but news releases on such patrols only say which month they’ll take place.
Tuesday’s news release on Operation Prairie Thunder’s efforts in Sturgis and Winner said the saturation patrol resulted in 13 arrests and 25 total drug charges across the two cities, but did not mention the city of Brookings.

In response to a question from South Dakota Searchlight, Highway Patrol spokesman Brad Reiners confirmed that the Highway Patrol had not conducted a saturation patrol in Brookings.
Brookings Mayor Ope Niemeyer told South Dakota Searchlight that he was away from town on business last week, but said he hadn’t heard anything this week about extra troopers in town while he was away. He wouldn’t be able to comment on what impact, if any, the city’s announcement had on saturation patrol plans, he said.
The city had posted the notice to let residents know there could be additional officers in town, Brookings City Manager Paul Briseno told South Dakota Searchlight on Wednesday, and to clear up any confusion within the community about where those officers came from. There had been “questions in the community” about Operation Prairie Thunder, he said.
The state gave notice to Brookings that it intended to conduct its Dec. 17-19 saturation patrol, Briseno said, but did not reach out about its change of plans.
Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms did not immediately respond to a question on whether the city’s announcement of a patrol influenced decisions about where to send troopers.

Maura Healey said Tuesday that officials are exploring how to connect residents with other insurance options.
“We’ve seen premiums expected to increase two or three times,” Healey said on GBH News’ Boston Public Radio. “Now the good news — and I hope to be out with more word on this soon — we’re working to see how we can come up with ways to cover people.”
Tuesday marked the Health Connector’s deadline for Bay Staters to sign up for plans that start on January 1. It’s been a tumultuous open enrollment cycle, with more than 10,000 people already dropping coverage as they grapple with sticker shock from premium spikes.
In the aftermath of the country’s longest government shutdown, Congress couldn’t reach a bipartisan deal to extend enhanced premium tax credits, which are slated to expire on December 31 under a 2022 federal law.
Healey said Tuesday that the loss of subsidies will translate into “upwards of 350,000” Massachusetts residents losing their health insurance. GBH co-host Jim Braude asked Healey to clarify whether her administration is examining whether those people “could be covered by the state in some fashion.”
“Well there are other programs, Jim. There are other health insurance plans,” Healey replied. “And we just want to make sure that, you know, those people, if they qualify for a different plan, that we’re able to get them into that.”
Analysts say Massachusetts residents will face additional health insurance losses in 2027, as new Medicaid work requirements take effect under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A recent report advised the state to develop a model similar to the “COVID-era command center” to thwart coverage losses and ensure compliance with forthcoming federal regulations.
Massachusetts is expected to lose $3.5 billion annually once all health care components of that federal law take effect, according to Audrey Shelto of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation of Massachusetts. 
Healey did not directly answer a question from a caller who asked the governor to use her power and tap into the state’s more than $8 billion rainy day fund to stave off federal funding cuts. The caller, identified as Chris in Boston, said he has a disability and relies on MassHealth.
“I will say I am focused as we move into this budget season on making sure that we do what we need to do to protect the most vulnerable among us,” said Healey, who must file her fiscal 2027 budget proposal by January 28.
Later in the interview, Healey lamented that “health care is broken in this country.”
“And we’re seeing it every day with what’s happening with escalating health care costs for people and businesses around this country,” Healey said. “You know in Massachusetts, we can only work with the money that we have. And you know, you see the reports of hospitals struggling.”
The governor’s comments came after a veteran nurse called in to reflect on the closure of Carney Hospital in Dorchester during the Steward Health Care bankruptcy crisis. The caller, identified as Susan in Milton, told Healey Massachusetts has a “dearth of hospitals” and that she “had never seen health care so bad in my life.”
The state seized another Steward hospital, St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Brighton, by eminent domain in September 2024. Nurses at the facility — since renamed Boston Medical Center-Brighton — voted to authorize a three-day strike depending on how contract negotiations unfold, the Massachusetts Nurses Association announced Monday.
BMC Brighton nurses are concerned about potential plans to eliminate certain positions, curtail access to a pension plan, reduce paid time-off benefits, increase health insurance costs and not raise pay for the majority of nurses, the union said. The MNA said it represents 650 nurses at the hospital.
“To do this to our members, who already sacrificed so much during the turmoil of the Steward crisis and stuck with this hospital to ensure the safety of our community just adds further insult to the injury we have already suffered,” said Kate Cashman, a BMC Brighton nurse and bargaining committee co-chair.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gov.-Maura-Healey-at-the-Boston-Public-Library-on-Dec.-23-2025.webp?fit=1024%2C567&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 13:58:06.949556

(File photo)North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey is asking President Donald Trump not to pardon Greg Lindberg, who pleaded guilty last year to fraud and money laundering.
In a letter dated Tuesday, Dec. 23, Causey described Lindberg’s criminal conduct as deliberate and sustained.
“Mr. Lindberg’s criminal conduct was not incidental, technical, or victimless,” Causey wrote.

A former insurance executor, he pled guilty last year to leading a $2 billion fraud and money laundering scheme, which profited off of thousands of people who had insurance through his Durham-based companies.

In a separate trial, he was convicted of attempting to bribe Causey, a Republican, who wore a wire for the Federal Bureau of Investigations to record Lindberg. 
The full FBI investigation took 18 months. In his letter to Trump, Causey wrote that Lindberg was recorded attempting to bribe him, in his official capacity as insurance commissioner, to remove a senior department official who found and exposed “serious financial improprieties” in Lindberg’s insurance work.
“The evidence presented was not speculative. It was contemporaneously recorded, exhaustively investigated, and ultimately proven in federal court,” Causey wrote. 
“Mr. Lindberg’s actions were a calculated attempt to undermine regulatory oversight, evade accountability, and silence those whose duty it was to safeguard policyholders, retirees, and working families,” the letter continued.
Causey said Lindberg’s misconduct and its consequences did not end with his conviction.
Instead, the victims — including policyholders and employees – continue to face the fallout and repercussions associated with the wrongdoings. 
“These harms are real, ongoing, and irreparable,” Causey wrote. “A pardon would not undo them; it would compound them by signaling that wealth, influence, and persistence can outweigh accountability.”
The letter comes as Lindberg has hired Keith Schiller, a longtime Trump associate, to lobby for a pardon on his behalf. 
U.S. Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican representing North Carolina who is not seeking reelection in 2026, said in a social media post that he fully agrees with Causey.
“There should be no pardon given the troubling nature of this crime and all the evidence that supported the conviction,” Tillis wrote on X. 
During Trump’s first administration he granted a pardon to former N.C. Congressman Robin Hayes. Hayes, who was head of the N.C. Republican Party at the time, was accused of lying to FBI agents during the bribery investigation and had accepted a plea deal. In issuing the pardon, the White House said Hayes had the support of Tillis and other members of the state delegation.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG-3249-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 12:59:00.453913

Liz Brown will no longer chair the Indiana Senate’s Judiciary Committee after she earlier quit a Republican leadership position in protest of the congressional redistricting plan’s defeat.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray’s office announced late Tuesday that Brown had been removed from the Judiciary chair post she had held since the 2021 legislative session.
Brown, R-Fort Wayne, was a vocal supporter of the redistricting proposal demanded by President Donald Trump that the Republican-dominated Senate rejected in a 31-19 vote on Dec. 11. The following day, Brown resigned as the Senate assistant majority floor leader in charge of communications.
Brown’s position as Judiciary Committee chair had more direct influence on legislation, such as the handling of an immigration crackdown bill she’s sponsoring that has resulted in a conflict between her and state Attorney General Todd Rokita.
Brown said in a statement that Bray informed her of her ouster on Tuesday.
“It is apparent that effects linger from our failure to draw fair maps that would promote conservative Hoosier voices in Washington,” Brown said. “Senator Bray is utilizing his right to redefine Senate leadership after a tumultuous Fall. As I’ve said, our caucus has rebuilding to do to repair communication and trust with voters, and I will continue to do that.”
Bray’s office did not immediately reply Wednesday to a request for comment about why he removed Brown from the position.
Brown is also in a primary fight for her Senate seat.
Sen. Cyndi Carrasco, R-Indianapolis, will replace Brown as Judiciary Committee chair when the legislative session resumes in early January.
Carrasco, who joined Brown in voting to support the redistricting plan, is in her third year as a senator and is vice president and general counsel at the University of Indianapolis. She served as state inspector general under Gov. Mike Pence and was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Marion County prosecutor in 2022.
No other leadership changes have been made among Senate Republicans following the vote on redistricting, which the GOP senators opposed by a 21-19 margin.
Senate Majority Floor Leader Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, was another outspoken redistricting supporter but has maintained his high-level post and memberships on the Senate’s influential appropriations and tax committees.

Colchester, Vermont

Morgan Walker Brown died peacefully surrounded by love on Dec. 16. A person of enduring determination and wise compassion, to the very end he used his prose and his voice to advocate for people in need. Morgan inspired many to follow in his example of empathy, kindness and compassion. 
Among the many hats that Morgan wore, he was primarily a writer and activist in the Montpelier community. In recent years, he even began to show up around the community in a Santa suit to bring a smile and joy to those often forgotten in his role of Wandering Santa; this role had started as a small act of love for his visiting granddaughter and blossomed into a much larger deed as he subsequently brought holiday cheer to homeless encampments during the coldest months. His poetry was read aloud in press conferences and by legislators in the State House. Most importantly he presented it as a tool to advocate for people to have shelter and housing. 
Morgan spent many years experiencing homelessness in the latter half of his life. He was never afraid to push people to truly understand disability justice. Even while unsheltered, he never missed an opportunity to advocate for those who had less than he did. He spent his days surrounded by those in suits and tidy haircuts advocating for change, sticking out intentionally to draw attention to his cause. Morgan was not paid for this work; it was not a job but a calling in every sense of the word. It was who he was and was in every stitch of his being. 
After decades of experiencing homelessness, he found what he recently referred to as his “forever home,” which brought him stability, real community and deep friendships. He lived his life out in a small studio apartment that was “enough” for him. He had longed for all of this while he lived unsheltered and worked his whole life for all people to have the privilege of a place to call home. In the end of his life he was clear that he had found peace. 
Morgan leaves behind his beloved cat Cleopatra whom he adopted from the Central Vermont Humane Society 11 years ago. She lives up to her name as the Queen of his house. She brought him so much comfort and love, especially in the final year of his life in which she bestowed upon him strength and the ability to bear his trials with grace and dignity. She was most definitely his heart. 
He is survived by his siblings Alison Lawson and Jeff Hackett, his two children Justin Brown and Alex Grey, his daughter-in-law Rina Brown, and his beloved granddaughter Kirana Brown. 
And also, by his many friends, his beloved community, and those who have not yet found home. 
There is no better way to represent his wishes except in his own words. Morgan asked for all of us left behind to bring his empathy, love and compassion into all aspects of our lives. His challenge to us is to care for those who are experiencing homelessness; to fight for humane policies that treat all people like fellow human beings, every single day. 
In 2021 he wrote this poem while there was a twenty-seven-night protest on the statehouse steps to keep people sheltered:
In Lieu of Flowers 
(Remember and Care for the Living) 
For those living unhoused, 
abandoned to the streets, 
left to live in the woods, 
underneath bridges, 
sleep in dumpsters and the like; 
it is far too late to think of, 
remember fondly, send flowers 
or otherwise honor and memorialize them 
after they have languished and died from lying wet, 
frozen, alone and forgotten, 
due to deliberate indifference 
as well as from a lack 
of sufficient caring and empathy 
Morgan Brown fought for people, he represented people, and he showed up for people. In his final days, he asked that his legacy be carried on in all of us. Let us show up as he would have. In his own words, let us care for and remember the living each time we think of him. Morgan asked that donations in his honor be made to End Homelessness Vermont and Another Way. 
A memorial service will be held at a later date.

If we’re being honest, 2025 did not start out great. For basically the whole month of January, a series of wildfires raged across Los Angeles, killing hundreds (more on that number below). On the other side of the country, an Arctic blast brought historic snowfall and bitter cold deep into the South. Then Donald Trump took office for a second time on January 20 and immediately began to unravel the climate progress the United States had made under Joe Biden.
The rest of the year, which is on track to tie for the second hottest on record, was just as momentous, bringing all manner of climate events — some good, some bad. In a lot of ways, we’ll look back on 2025 as a critical moment, both for the environment and humanity. Here’s why.
 A firestorm consumes Los Angeles

Starting on January 7, wildfires continued for weeks and burned 78 square miles across Los Angeles, driven by strong winds and fueled by extra-dry vegetation. (The conflagration had climate change’s fingerprints all over it.) The fires destroyed more than 16,000 structures and forced more than 180,000 people to evacuate. In part because the blazes were burning through extremely affluent neighborhoods, the economic damages are estimated to be between $76 billion and $131 billion. The fires were 1 of 14 billion-dollar disasters to hit the U.S. in the first half of 2025, according to the research group Climate Central. (In May, the Trump administration announced that the federal government would stop tracking billion-dollar disasters, an essential way to assess climate risks.)
Officially, the fires killed 30 people. But this year, researchers got a better idea of just how bad wildfire smoke is for public health, as it exacerbates conditions like asthma and cardiovascular disease. In August, scientists published a new estimate of the L.A. wildfire death toll that factored in fatalities caused by the resulting haze: 440, or even higher. The next month, other researchers estimated that wildfire smoke already kills 40,000 Americans each year, which could soar to 71,000 by 2050 if humanity’s carbon emissions remain high. The flames themselves, it seems, kill but a small fraction of the fire’s total victims.
 Trump takes takes a hatchet to environmental regulations

Los Angeles was still burning when Donald Trump was sworn in for a second time and quickly began overhauling government agencies and axing environmental rules. The Trump administration’s deep cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, could leave communities even more vulnerable to the threat of wildfire smoke. Later in the summer, Trump signed the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill into law, which among other things tore up the only climate plan the U.S. had. That killed the tax credits that consumers were using to electrify their homes and offset the cost of EVs, and destroyed the capital that Indigenous tribes were using to develop clean energy projects. (Also see Grist’s recent coverage of the weird ways that Trump has been changing the culture and language around energy and climate change.)
 Extreme flooding is here to stay

Just as climate change is making wildfires worse, it’s actually making rainfall more catastrophic, too. That dynamic played out tragically on the Fourth of July weekend when flash flooding struck central Texas, most devastatingly in Kerr County, killing at least 135 people. Part of the problem is that, generally speaking, the warmer the atmosphere gets, the more moisture it can hold and eventually dump as rain. Making matters worse, the Gulf of Mexico has been exceptionally warm of late, which sent still more moisture into the atmosphere above Texas. (The same factors were fueling gnarly storms across the central and southern U.S. in the spring.) The resulting devastation is forcing a disaster-response reckoning not just in Kerr County but in similarly vulnerable communities across the U.S. Really, the world over is struggling to cope with extreme flooding: Storms and cyclones have killed more than 1,750 people in Asia since mid-November.
 Data centers emerge as a major environmental threat

In 2025, another kind of human-made environmental disaster garnered growing scrutiny: data centers. In February, we reported on Georgia joining other states in extending the life of fossil-fuel power plants (which the Trump administration has also been forcing to stay open) to meet the tech industry’s extreme demand for electricity. The AI boom is hurting consumers, too: All that extra infrastructure is driving up electricity prices for households, especially in data-center hotspot states. The industry is such an environmental mess that Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, suggested this summer that we build data centers in space instead.
Data centers are creating a water crisis, too: Nationwide in 2023, the facilities used 17 billion gallons of water directly to cool equipment, but they required more than 10 times that amount indirectly because they use so much electricity that’s generated elsewhere with steam. Accordingly, researchers at Cornell University this year found that the industry can reduce both its water and electricity footprints by building data centers where there’s abundant wind or solar energy, like West Texas.
 Earth crosses an ominous planetary boundary and tipping point

This year, scientists hit us with a one-two punch of bad environmental news: the crossing of the first “tipping point” and the breaching of another “planetary boundary.” A tipping point is when an Earth system suddenly and often irreversibly changes into something dramatically different, while a planetary boundary is a threshold that keeps the planet’s environments hospitable to life. Think of it like driving down a road, where the tipping point is an imminent cliff and a planetary boundary is a big sign warning of the drop.
In September, scientists announced that the seventh of nine boundaries had been crossed, this time the steady acidification of the oceans. (A quarter of humanity’s CO2 emissions have been absorbed by seawater, which creates carbonic acid.) That acidification is interfering with the ability of many organisms, like corals, mollusks, and crustaceans, to build their shells.
And speaking of corals, less than a month later, another team of researchers announced that the precipitous decline of reef ecosystems has pushed the planet to its first major tipping point. In the last 50 years, half of the world’s live coral cover has disappeared, as acidification pairs with rising ocean temperatures. All that stress causes corals to release the symbiotic algae that provide them energy, leading to coral bleaching. Even though corals are tipping, scientists are still breeding them in labs, hopefully finding varieties that can better stand the heat.
 Countries cop-out at COP

You’d think that with such dire news about tipping points and planetary boundaries coming out, the world would get more ambitious about lowering its emissions. But 10 years after the Paris Agreement — which set out to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, or in an ideal world, 1.5 degrees C — countries at the United Nations’ annual COP30 climate conference in November failed to come to an agreement on winding down fossil fuels. So we’re on track to get between 2.3 and 2.8 degrees of catastrophic warming by the end of this century, according to the U.N.’s own math. Every fraction of a degree means ever more severe effects of climate change — melting ice, sea level rise, extreme heat — and the further we go past 1.5 degrees, the more carbon we’ll have to remove from the atmosphere to bring temperatures back down to a safe level.
 Hurricane season ends without a single US landfall

This spring, forecasters were looking at high ocean temperatures in the Atlantic — the fuel for hurricanes — and predicting an above-average season with around 10 named storms. But as the summer stretched on, the hurricanes that seemed headed for the mainland U.S. instead turned back out to sea. Hurricane season ended on November 30 without a single hurricane making landfall in the country for the first time in a decade, thanks to some atmospheric quirks above the Southeast.
The Caribbean, though, did not fare so well this year. At the end of October, Hurricane Melissa — supercharged by climate change — ravaged Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Because of extra-hot ocean waters, the storm’s maximum sustained wind speeds doubled from 70 mph to 140 mph in just 18 hours. So while it’s unusual for the U.S. to escape landfall for a whole season, tropical cyclones will only get worse from here as ocean temperatures climb: This was only the second year in recorded history to have spawned three or more Category 5 hurricanes.
 Climate action has become unstoppable in many ways

Heading into 2026, it’s easy to look at all this and say, “Well, we’re borked.” Yes, the environment is buckling under the increasingly heavy burden of climate change. And yes, the Trump administration will continue its war on climate action. But unstoppable changes — the good kind — are also in motion that will help improve public health and reduce emissions, no matter what the federal government decrees.
For one, those environmental tipping points have positive counterparts that are now unfolding, thanks to local incentives and national policies elsewhere. The market share for new electric vehicles in Oslo, Norway, for instance, exploded from 13.6 percent to 95.8 percent in a decade, according to a report released in October. Solar panels have gotten so cheap that it’s now more economical to deploy renewables than to build more fossil fuel infrastructure. Accordingly, renewables are growing like crazy in the U.S. and beyond, with a new report finding that wind and solar are more than meeting the global rise in demand for electricity. Indeed, in the first half of 2025, renewables generated more electricity around the world than coal for the first time. The leaders of Africa’s growing economies, meanwhile, plotted a bold strategy this year to become a continent of climate solutions.
And keep in mind that in the absence of federal U.S. action on climate change, states and cities have stepped up to fill the void and have even increased their ambitions this year: They set their own emissions-reduction targets, regulated their own utilities, bolstered public transportation, drafted energy-efficient building codes — the list goes on and on. Yes, 2025 was an ominous year, both environmentally and politically, but that doesn’t mean that all is lost in 2026.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-24 17:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Advocates call on lawmakers to make changes to probation system,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/24/advocates-call-on-lawmakers-to-make-changes-to-probation-system/,"Legislation was introduced this year, but it never received a public hearing. Advocates want lawmakers to consider a similar bill in 2026.","Advocates, formerly incarcerated people and family members of incarcerated men and women are calling on state lawmakers to put forward a bill that would prevent people on probation from being sent back to prison for minor technical violations.
Legislation was introduced this past spring by Rep. Josh Hall, D-Hartford, but it failed to receive a public hearing. Advocates are urging lawmakers to consider a similar bill during the coming 2026 session.
Hall’s proposal sought to prevent people from being automatically sent back to prison for non-criminal violations of parole — things like missed appointments, failed drug tests, missing curfew or treatment or leaving the state without permission.
Hall’s bill also suggested introducing a system of “earned time credit” where people’s probation sentences could be shortened for complying with the conditions of their release. It would also have removed the fees associated with probation, including a $200 supervision fee and additional fees that vary depending on which program the probationer is enrolled in. (The $200 fee is usually waived by the court, and that program fees for sex offender programs are based on a sliding scale depending on a person’s income, according to a spokesperson for the Judicial Branch.)
Advocates and lawmakers gathered to discuss the issue at the Elmwood Community Center in West Hartford last week.
At the event, Talia Orr, co-founder of Seniors in Hartford Organizing for Power, told the story of her grandson, who is currently incarcerated. Several years ago, at age 28, he was arrested and placed on probation for three-and-a-half years. 
For the first two-and-a-half years, Orr said, her grandson was doing well until he missed a dose of medication. He missed a required health care appointment — a violation of his probation — and was sent back to prison for two months on a $50,000 bond. Orr declined to give her grandson’s name, citing concerns for his safety.
Orr said after her grandson was released, he checked into a rehab center. But his probation officer failed to inform the court, she said. When her grandson missed a required court date, a warrant was issued for his arrest and he was incarcerated again, this time on a $500,000 bond. 
Orr told the Connecticut Mirror that after about 30 days, things were straightened out with the court and her grandson was released. But in September of this year, his probation was revoked after being arrested again on another technical violation. He took a plea deal and was sentenced to three-and-a-half years. 
“If he makes it through all the restriction and pressures, including receiving proper medication and reentry support, that will really help stabilize him,” Orr said at the event. “He will be 37 years old.” 
Alex Brown, who is now working toward a masters degree in social work at the University of Connecticut, said at last week’s event that she also faced challenges while on probation. She’d spent four-and-a-half years at York Correctional Institution after being charged with vehicular manslaughter at age 19. At age 25, she was released on probation, and vowed she would never be incarcerated again. 
“ For many women, the fear of a [probation] violation shapes everything. A missed curfew, a forgotten permission slip, a phone call that doesn’t go through, any of it can mean being sent back,” Brown said. 
After years on probation, Brown said she received a violation for having police contact during a domestic violence incident. She was arrested and incarcerated for 48 hours. 
“ When I was originally incarcerated, I used to watch women come back again and again, and I just didn’t understand why. I used to think if someone just gave me a chance, I would never come back,” Brown said. “But I went back too — and it’s not because I was dangerous. It’s not because I committed a new crime, but because technical violations function as a revolving door in the system.” 
For Brown, the violation also led to an extension of her probation period. She has now been on probation for nine years. 
“Technical violations function as a revolving door in the system.” Alex Brown
Lawmakers who were present at the meeting expressed concerns that probation violations are required to be listed on applications for food assistance, known as SNAP. 
State Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told CT Mirror that she planned to rally other lawmakers to pressure the legislature’s Judiciary Committee chairs to take up the bill when the 2026 legislative session begins in February. 
“ The system’s broken, and people are just trying to do their best and keep getting punished,” said Gilchrest. “ People should not be incarcerated for these technical violations. It just feels like we keep moving back the starting line.”
Gilchrest said that as chair of the Human Services Committee, she could also introduce a separate bill that would address one of the concerns of advocates — the fact that people have to report any violations of probation on their applications for SNAP benefits, making them ineligible for SNAP.  
“And to hear … you missed a letter, or you got caught doing something that’s not putting the public in danger, and now you’re going to lose your food and you’re going to be put back in jail … that seems absurd,” said Gilchrest. 
Rep. Kate Farrar, D-West Hartford, who also attended the event, said she sees a clear need to boost funding for reentry centers, which provide assistance to returning citizens. “It’s really about making sure that as folks are coming back into their communities, that they actually have a fair shot at being able to support themselves,” Farrar said. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, a New Haven Democrat who co-chairs the Judiciary Committee, told CT Mirror in an interview that he supported the concept of the bill. He said depending on the probation officer, parole violations could be “teachable moments” for both the officer and the person on probation, or they could be used as overly constrictive ways to control the probationer. 
“It’s an important subject that I think should be raised,” he said.  
But Winfield said he couldn’t promise the committee would introduce a bill, given the large number of issues they have to consider in a short timeframe. 
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said in an email to CT Mirror that while he was “sensitive” to the concerns about probation, which had been discussed in the past, the bill had failed to get widespread support from lawmakers. 
“Perhaps it will be looked upon more favorably during the upcoming session that begins in early February,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0671-Copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 12:59:00.453913

Lowell, Massachusetts
Died Dec. 9, 2025
Lincoln, Massachusetts

Linda Kelliher Samets of Charlotte, Vermont, and New York, N.Y., passed away peacefully in Lincoln, Massachusetts on Dec. 9, 2025, following complications from recent surgery. A beloved wife, mother, sister, artist, horsewoman and friend, she was 79.
Linda was born on March 8, 1946, in Lowell, Massachusetts. The fifth of nine children, she attended Concord-Carlisle High School, where her artistic gifts emerged. She graduated from Massachusetts College of Art and Design (MassArt), which nurtured her creativity and helped set the course for her career and life. After college, Linda worked at an advertising agency in Boston before moving into a graphic design role at WGBH.
After moving to Vermont, Linda opened a one-room design studio in Burlington. At the time, she had been turned away from local agencies that told her that her work was too unconventional. But Linda knew better. She trusted her instincts. And so, she created her own place, her own path, and, eventually, her own company.
Over the decades that followed, Linda, together with her partner in life and business, Yoram, transformed her small design firm into Kelliher Samets Volk (now KSV), a nationally recognized marketing agency with offices in New York and Burlington. Her creativity, intuition, professionalism, and humanity influenced generations of designers, writers, and strategists.
Beyond her work at KSV, Linda was dedicated to numerous community organizations in Vermont, including Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, Special Olympics, Burlington City Arts and the Gailer School.
Linda had a deep love for animals and often said she preferred their company over that of most people. While she always had dogs and cats at her Charlotte home, her greatest passion was for horses. For many years, she owned and operated Windrunner Farm, a 30-horse barn in Shelburne, and she continued riding four or five days a week well into her seventies. For Linda, riding served as both a grounding influence and a source of joy.
After retiring from KSV, Linda’s life revolved around her family, horses, and her home in Charlotte, where she lived for over four decades. Though she described her daily routine in retirement as “puttering,” in reality, it was action-packed: she walked three miles a day (tracked carefully), painted in her home studio, cooked dinner for herself and Yoram every night, and enjoyed cards, dominoes, and any TV show with enough horses in it. On Friday evenings, she and Yoram brought Shabbat into their home, lighting candles and saying prayers, finding purpose in something bigger than themselves.
In addition to her husband, Yoram, Linda is survived by her daughter, Alex Samets, of Baltimore, Maryland, and her son, Theo Samets, of Los Angeles, California. She took great joy in seeing her children become the adults they are today. In recent months, she looked forward to becoming a grandmother and spending more time in Baltimore.
She is also survived by her sisters, Mardie Luppold, of Shirley, Massachusetts, and Leslie Luppold, of Concord, Massachusetts; her brothers, David (Christine) Luppold, of Concord, Massachusetts, Jonathan (Denise) Luppold, of Maynard, Massachusetts, and Jay (Deborah) Luppold, of Concord, New Hampshire; her brother-in-law, Robert Marquis, of Concord, Massachusetts; her sister-in-law, Carole Smith, of Portland, Oregon; and many beloved nieces and nephews. Linda was predeceased by her sisters, Priscilla Marquis and Deborah Luppold, and by her brother, Richard Luppold.
In lieu of flowers, contributions in Linda’s memory may be made to Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, a community she valued deeply, or to the Graham Equestrian Center.

(Photo by 	mroland/Getty Images)A supermoon — large, full, near the eastern horizon, with a golden, orange glow. The moon was at perigee, the closest point to the earth, and it looked massive and so bright that I thought the Kauffmans had installed a yard light. Of course not. The Kauffmans have no electricity here in Buggy Land, in the middle of the Old Order Amish settlement.
Frost Moon. Beaver Moon. Digging Moon. Deer Rutting Moon. It arrives just about the same time as the first frost. It marks the time when the beavers are preparing their lodges for winter.
And the time when animals are foraging for nuts and digging dens. The time when bucks abandon caution, chasing after and mating with does. The time when your car might collide with that deer on the road, smashing your grill, pitching the wild animal up into the air, only to land on your vehicle, moon-cratering your hood.
But I was the only one with a car in the Kauffmans’ barnyard. A horse and cart rattled in stuffed with young Amish neighbor women, their bonnets slipped down over their prayer caps. The women had ridden several miles in the dark, their slow-moving vehicle reflector on the back of the cart, their head lamps and a lantern in the front, and the illumination of the moon.
“Hello!” The Kauffmans called, parents and four children pouring out of their side door.
Inside, the house was decorated with a big sparkly blue banner hanging on the wall that read:
H-A-P-P-Y B-I-R-T-H-D-A-Y!
My childhood birthdays were fun and celebratory. Filled with small gifts, a birthday cake, parties and games of bobbing for apples and pin the tail on the donkey.
“This is the day they gave babies away, with every pound of tea,” my mother sang every year on my birthday, and we giggled and laughed together. Even as a child, I understood the humor and irony of the dark old folk song.
But as childhood moved into adulthood and my mother’s light passed too soon into the great beyond, birthdays became quieter and more solitary. A nice walk in the woods with my dog was all the celebration I desired. But this year was a milestone birthday, and I was happy to join a family who wanted to celebrate it.
The Kauffmans’ dining table was extended, filling the room, with about 15 wooden chairs of various sizes and shapes pushed into place. A veggie train, a coupling of halved green, yellow and red peppers stuffed with carrot and celery sticks, radishes, broccoli, and dip, chugged down the center of the table, its wheels, round slices of the tillage radishes that the Kauffmans grew as cover crops in their garden, tooth-picked in place. The engine was a cucumber with two carrot stumps for smoke stacks with cauliflower florets as puffs of smoke.
We all had healthy servings of the grilled chicken that Martha Yutzy had brought in a Swahn’s insulated cooler that kept the chicken warmer than any device I’d ever experienced. The train disappeared quickly, the children rushing to dismantle the cars, popping the raw vegetables in their mouths. Then came the dessert, a rich chocolate pan cake with white frosting swirling across the top.
“Now let’s sing for Mary,” Elmer said. “What song would you like?”
The guests were surprised I knew the common Amish hymns. But there was nothing I liked more than to hear my neighbors sing. A few years before, when Bertha, the mother and grandmother of this family, had lain dying in her living room, relatives gathered around her bed every night to sing.
Connecting to the divine through song

A cappella, in four-part harmony, their voices drifted through the window screens and floated toward me across the soybean field on the humid, summer air. I sat in front of my house and listened, every word clear and resonant, carrying the very intent to soothe and console. After several months, I began to recognize the hymns and their cadences. I couldn’t always translate the German, but I became familiar with the words and their accompanying tunes.
At the Kauffmans’ home birthday party, the parents, children, and invited guests belted out the hymns, the notes, represented by shapes in their hymnals, strong and bold, but nimble enough to harmonize with the others. I sat back and absorbed it all, singing along when I knew the words. These were the same hymns sung to Bertha, but this rendition was so much more upbeat and joyful.
We cleaned up all the dishes, washing and drying them by hand, plates, glasses, cups and saucers stacked back in the cupboard.
Then I ducked. A tennis ball whizzed over my head. The Kauffman boys had donned their baseball gloves and had taken positions in an imaginary infield in the living room. The ball flew back and forth, back and forth, thumping into the pockets of their gloves. The inning finally over, Menno, the 4-year-old, disappeared into the back room.
A few minutes later, Menno returned, waving a yellow flying sky lantern, or a trance balloon. Sky lanterns are paper lights that lie flat in their wrappers, but once you ignite a flame, they billow out and can be launched like hot-air balloons.
We all stepped outside with the lantern, the light of the supermoon bouncing off the metal roof of the goat shed. I’d never seen a sky lantern before. I knew it couldn’t be environmentally correct because it would eventually turn into litter. In another drier landscape, it could even be a fire hazard. But Martha lit the flame, the lantern lifting into the air, and I was immediately entranced.
Up over the goat shed, the lantern glided in the eastern sky, over the pasture that had caught many Kauffman softballs in the pocket of its glove. Up and up and away toward the neighbor’s pond where a few deer were bedding down for the night, drifting from us, smaller and smaller, the flame sparking and beginning to burn up the paper.
“It looks like a star,” I said.
“It’s a star!” The Kauffman boys echoed.
“It’s the Star of Bethlehem!” I said.
“The Star of Bethlehem,” the boys agreed.
Then the lantern seemed to stop, a tiny speck in comparison to the huge round moon that shone brighter and brighter, its golden glow bathing us in light in one of the darkest skies in the state. The lantern hung below the blue sparkle of the Pleiades star cluster, flickering, twinkling, in the constellation of Taurus.

I imagined a horse pawing, a beaver digging in, a deer flying through the air just like the lantern. All the folklore, the mythology, the religious imagery and beliefs throughout all the cultures of the world, were present in the night sky, guiding us to the place where we were meant to be.
Quietly at first, then louder and louder, we sang:
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem
Shining afar through shadows dim,
Giving the light for those who long have gone,
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on.
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem (Star of Bethlehem,)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns.
Give us a light to guide the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on (shine on.)

Mike DeWine signed several bills meant to provide property tax relief into law, but anti-property tax advocates aren’t impressed, and they are moving forward with their efforts to abolish them altogether.
‘They’re gonna price me out of my home’
Once his dream home, Brian Massie said after 20 years, it’s turned into a nightmare.
“I saw that the property taxes had gone up 40%,” Massie said.
The Concord Township homeowner has been frustrated with bills, ones he never thought in his nearly 80 years of life would get so high over the past two decades.
“If we stay on this path of ever-increasing property taxes, they’re gonna price me out of my home,” he said.
State lawmakers say they know it’s a problem, which is why they are cheering some brand-new laws.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has signed a slew of bills aiming to relieve property tax burdens.
DeWine says he wants to, “Fairly achieve property tax relief and at the same time, protect our schools, our police, our fire, and our essential other services.
House Bills 186 and 335 limit how much money school districts can get from rising home values — tying tax increases to inflation. These bills passed both chambers in a bipartisan fashion.
H.B. 309 allows county budget commissions to reduce property tax levies. It mainly passed along party lines, but a few Democrats joined the Republicans to pass it, while several members of the GOP voted no.
H.B. 129 implements a check on tax increases from school levies.
H.B. 124 gives county auditors greater oversight in using property tax sales information for determining property valuations.
“Property taxes in Ohio will be more understandable, and they’ll be more predictable for those taxpayers who pay property taxes,” said Pat Tiberi, the chair of the governor’s property tax working group.
But Massie isn’t impressed.
“Too little, too late,” he said. “If they can’t do anything for the seniors, that was sort of the straw that, as they say, broke the camel’s back.”
Ballot proposal
I asked Massie if he felt that Ohioans needed to take matters into their own hands because their representatives aren’t listening.
“That was basically our thought,” he said.
Massie is a part of the Committee to Abolish Ohio Property Taxes, currently collecting signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. Advocates from Citizens for Property Tax Reform, another group with the same mission, said it has collected more than 100,000 signatures already.
Lawmakers are worried, which accounts for the sudden action after years of letting taxes grow.
“I have to say that the threat of a ballot initiative is part of the thing that’s driving this,” House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said.
Those efforts are not good enough, some Ohioans have told News 5 and testified at the statehouse over the last year.
“These bills that were just signed into law, are they enough to gain your support?” I asked Massie.
“No, absolutely not,” he said.
The groups are trying to get the amendment on the November 2026 ballot.
The Committee to Abolish Ohio Property Taxes has already gotten signatures from the required 44 of 88 counties needed and has hundreds of petitioners deployed across the state, Massie said. It needs about 415,000 valid signatures and is aiming to submit about 620,000.
Education
Schools have been arguing for months now that these bills take away much-needed dollars for kids when they are already facing cuts from the state in expected funding.
“We’ll talk about [cutting] staffing, which impacts what programs we might consider to remain here at Parma and those that we might not be able to support,” Parma Schools Superintendent Dr. Scott J. Hunt told WEWS/Ohio Capital Journal. “Certainly, those things impact the quality of education we can provide for our students.”
While Massie said that schools just need to be more responsible with their money, the leaders of Citizens for Property Tax Reform have a more sympathetic outlook. Organizer Beth Blackmarr said that lawmakers have spent hundreds of millions on a stadium for the Cleveland Browns, rather than fairly funding schools or focusing on property taxes.
This summer, state lawmakers gave the Browns a $600 million performance grant for their new Brook Park stadium using unclaimed funds. Ohio’s Division of Unclaimed Funds currently oversees about $4.9 billion in funds, including forgotten bank accounts, utility deposits, uncashed checks and more.
Blackmarr said that the time spent finagling this proposal would have been better spent on problems that citizens are facing.
Districts worry that the ballot proposal will render public schools obsolete.

An Ohio judge has temporarily blocked the state from handing over $600 million to the Cleveland Browns for their new stadium.
Attorney Jeff Crossman is cheering Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Bill Sperlazzato’s ruling — a temporary restraining order (TRO) that will prohibit the state from using the cash, which comes from Ohioans, for the next two weeks.
“We’re pleased that the judge saw things the way we have been seeing them all along, which is that the state’s taking of this property is likely improper,” Crossman said after the hearing. “The process for which they’ve failed to undertake needs to be followed, and the state court judge hit the pause button to say that ‘Hey, let’s verify what they’re doing is actually constitutional.'”
This summer, state lawmakers gave the Browns a $600 million performance grant for their new Brook Park stadium using unclaimed funds. Ohio’s Division of Unclaimed Funds currently oversees about $4.9 billion in funds, including forgotten bank accounts, utility deposits, uncashed checks and more.
To check for unclaimed funds, visit unclaimedfunds.ohio.gov.
Previously, attorneys for the state argued that they are allowed to take the money, and some lawmakers claim that Crossman’s team is “forum shopping,” as a federal judge just shot down a request for a preliminary injunction.
In testimony in early December at the federal court, Unclaimed Funds Finance Director Amy Schellhammer said that they have not provided any direct notice to Ohioans, nor is it posted on their website, that $1.7-1.9 billion in unclaimed funds will be taken on Jan. 1, 2026.
A hearing for a preliminary injunction, a possible block while the case is litigated, is set for January 8.
We have reached out to the Browns for comment.

He planned to run to Columbia by Sunday.
Davis’ goal was possible for the first time this year after nonprofit Palmetto Conservation Foundation completed a 218-mile stretch of paths connecting the state’s capital to its coast. Over the next five to seven years, the nonprofit wants to finish its 30-year goal of connecting about 520 miles of trail extending across the state.
The stretch from Columbia to Awendaw marked a major piece of that. The final, 26-mile piece, named Boyd Passage after the prominent Columbia family that sponsored it, opened to the public over the summer.
400-mile Palmetto Trail gets a boost in state aid to connect, maintain the pieces

Soon after that trail opened, Davis, who has done long trail runs in the past, considered trying to run the whole thing.
“‘Hey, we’ve got a very unique section of trail here that comes right into Columbia, and that would be really cool to do,’” the 46-year-old recalled thinking.
Because of the time commitment, however, the idea seemed too far-fetched. Davis put the idea in the back of his mind for several months, until he attended a banquet for nondenominational Christian ministry Young Life and began to come up with a plan.
Touched by the stories of children the ministry helped, Davis decided to run the entire 218 miles in three days as a fundraiser to pay camp fees. People could pledge between 50 cents and $10 per mile or opt to make a single donation.
By the end of his trek, Davis raised nearly $12,000 — enough to send at least two dozen children to camp, he said.
Davis’ story
Running past palmetto trees on the fishing inlet of Awendaw, Davis set off in the middle of the night toward his home in Blythewood, just north of Columbia.
What stood out to Davis as he made his way across the state was how different the trail could be from one moment to the next.

He’d run through glades of pine trees, their needles blanketing the path, followed miles later by swampland, cypress knees jutting out of the water on either side of him. In what felt like moments, that could turn into hardwood trees, shedding their leaves for the winter.
For about 47 miles, he ran through remote swampland, where he saw not a hint of civilization until the trail neared U.S. Highway 52 near Bonneau, and he watched the cars whiz past. At other points, such as when he reached Columbia, the trail turned into sidewalks along busy streets.
“The varying terrain that you encounter along the trail, it’s a little bit of everything,” Davis said. “I think it represents South Carolina well.”
Davis made it as far as Eutawville, about 100 miles into the run, before painful blisters covering his feet forced him to stop. His goal of completing the trek in just three days turned out to be too ambitious for his body, with the rapid pace causing severe pain.
Even though he knew he wasn’t going to be able to finish the run by Sunday, Davis didn’t want to quit. So, the team of about 15 people who signed up to accompany him and bring him meals stepped in. Davis hopped in the van they’d loaded up with gear, and his team did the next 110 miles or so as a relay race, he said.
Davis met up with them again outside Columbia’s Fort Jackson. Ignoring the painful blisters on his feet, Davis ran the final seven miles with his crew behind him.
Near the end, Davis, a civil engineer and road designer, deviated from the designated path slightly to run up South Main Street toward the Statehouse. He was on the team that designed the renovations on South Main, which opened in July. With a police escort behind him, he knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance, he said.
“For a brief moment, all the pain went away, and it was pure joy that I was going again,” Davis said. “Shortly thereafter, reality set in, and it was a struggle. But I made it that last seven miles.”
Davis reached the Columbia Canal just before 3 p.m. Saturday. At the time, he told himself he would never try that again, but just a day later, he was already thinking about his next trip, he said.
Once the full trail is finished, Davis would like to try and run the length of the state. He acknowledged that would mean slowing down from his attempted breakneck pace, which would mean asking more from the people who volunteered to help him from his fitness group.
Any sort of extended trail run involves a lot of coordination to get food, water and other gear while on the trail. For safety reasons, Davis likes to keep a second runner with him as often as possible, especially at night.
But if he could figure out the logistics, he would do it, he said.
“I would love that, more than anything,” he said. “The biggest part of it is time.”
The Palmetto Trail
Davis’ weekend run is the sort of thing the trail’s stewards envisioned. Of course, few people are going to run the entire trail, but connecting the pieces gives people the option to enjoy it however they please, said Mary Roe, the nonprofit’s executive director.
“Whether it’s a small, 10-minute hike or a 10-mile hike, the trail is a natural resource for people in the state to enjoy,” Roe said.
The trail still has some significant gaps, Roe said. One big obstacle is the Tyger River in the Upstate, which the trail must cross for completion. That means building a bridge, which is an expensive prospect, though how much will depend on the exact plans.
For the moment, staff are focused on expanding the trail out from Columbia, past Lake Murray, and to Newberry, which is about 40 miles northwest by road, Roe said. That will give people a longer contiguous trail to hike before it eventually connects to pieces in the Upstate.
The trail reaches 410 miles in separate pieces. Over the next five to seven years, Roe hopes to see another 120 miles or so added to connect the rest of them. Those numbers could change if the routes don’t happen as planned, though she was hopeful for the trail’s future, she said.
“Will it be challenging?” Roe said. “Sure. But I can say that we’ve got a lot of good trail movement and a lot of good discussions happening.”
The nonprofit sometimes builds pieces of trail on its own and sometimes works with other organizations to designate existing trails or help with upcoming trails to add to the network.
For instance, the Saluda Grade Trail, a 31-mile stretch of abandoned train rail turned trail stretching from Inman into North Carolina, will join the Palmetto Trail when it eventually opens. Work to transform the property into a trail is underway, according to the nonprofits running the project.
Connecting the Palmetto Trail to major pathways in other states, including North Carolina, is a step closer to a major goal for Roe. Eventually, she wants to see South Carolina’s trail system integrated into larger systems, perhaps even feeding off the Appalachian Trail.
For the time being, though, the focus is on connecting the state in one long “spine” of a system, as she called it. The 218-mile stretch from Columbia to Awendaw represented a major step toward that, she said.
“I think it legitimized us,” Roe said. “We really are building the largest trail project in South Carolina.”
Although much of the nonprofit’s funding comes from donations, close to $9 million has come from the state Legislature since 2014. That included $1 million in the current budget, which runs until the end of June.
The cost to open a section of trail varies, Roe said. For the 26 miles that opened this year, the Boyd Foundation donated $1.5 million. Upkeep and maintenance also come with a cost, as volunteers repair sections of trail.
The trail is also popular, especially after outdoor recreation boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic, Roe said.
The security cameras installed at certain trailheads get almost constant pings during the day, as people stop to eat lunch, take short walks or go for long hikes. She hopes the trail will become an economic driver, too, bringing outdoorsy tourists to the state and sending people through small towns they may not have visited otherwise.
“I think it’s a really special asset for the state of South Carolina,” Roe said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_9003-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 10:12:32.474975

(Courtesy photos)When Kevin Thompson, 65, retired to Hurley, New Mexico, in July 2023, he wanted to stay busy and get involved in his new community, so he volunteered at area food banks and the local radio station. Then he stumbled onto the state’s Aging and Long Term Services Department Ombudsman Program, and through it began volunteering in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.
A disabled U.S. Navy veteran who grew up in New York City, Thompson first encountered the state where he’d end up about 40 years ago while changing commands and driving with his three children from San Diego, California, to Virginia Beach, Virginia. 
“We got lost coming out of Deming because there was no GPS back in 1983,” he told Source New Mexico. “I made it close to Silver City and it left an impression on me, the scenery and everything…I said ‘Man, I’m going to come back here one day.’”
Before making the move to New Mexico, Thompson wound up in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he looked after his ill mother in her last years. Margarite Whitehead was eventually moved into a hospice facility and Thompson said he would visit her as much as possible. She passed in 2021.
Thompson said he learned a lot by spending time in the facility with her, getting to know the staff and other residents. He also volunteered at a local Veterans Affairs hospital.
“I sort of formed a bond with the elderly people that were there…They felt that no one listened to them. They felt disrespected,” he said. “They were just feeling really helpless and lost. And I understand what that’s like because I’ve been in the hospital with a brain tumor and it’s the scariest thing in the world knowing that you’re by yourself and there’s no one there for you.” 
After moving to New Mexico and searching for a volunteer opportunity to keep him busy, Thompson was pointed in the direction of the Fort Bayard Medical Center in Santa Clara. There, he met an older woman who told him about her experience volunteering as an ombudsman. He connected with the Aging and Long-Term Care Department and started the online training process around August 2025.
States began operating ombudsman programs in 1972 through the Older Americans Act. ALTSD spokesperson Joey Long told Source that New Mexico’s program currently has 17 ombudsman volunteers, but expects to add several more volunteers by January 2026. The program oversees volunteers throughout the state, who visit residents of assisted living and nursing facilities on a regular basis. They are tasked with ensuring residents receive adequate care, and that any of their concerns are heard and investigated. 
Thompson started volunteering in mid-September. He said the training took several weeks and included reviewing documents and reading materials before meeting virtually with program organizers and other volunteers. After training, volunteers are sent out to various care facilities to speak with residents and record what they hear and see.
Thompson now visits three facilities in his area, volunteering about three hours a week, and hears from residents about how they’re treated by staff, the quality of food, whether they’re receiving the correct amount of therapy and other issues, like buzzers going unanswered by staff and wanting to leave the facility for a weekend home visit. He also walks around the facility and records what he sees, hears and smells, such as a group of residents working on a puzzle together or a resident’s room that smells strongly of urine.
“I’m still trying to get my footing together, but I do enjoy it,” he said. “Volunteering is in my blood. It’s just something I’ve always done.”
Thompson said the veterans ward at the Fort Bayard Medical Center is his favorite to visit because he is able to connect with the residents about similar experiences. 
“Us veterans tell the best stories. And talking with someone that understands your lingo, your jargon, your state of mind — a lot of these guys are deeply emotional because they haven’t spoken to a veteran unless it’s like some guy that’s been there as long as they are,” Thompson said. “And they’re not all elderly. Some of them are just injured to the point where they can’t live by themselves.”
He added that he tries not to talk too much to residents, but lets them lead the conversation. In Cincinnati, he said, several staff members at his mother’s facility wouldn’t take her complaints seriously until family members got involved because she was blind and had dementia.
“That really hurt my mom a lot. She felt like her words didn’t have value,” Thompson said. “These are people who have led families, who have had careers, who used to be teachers, doctors, lawyers, mothers, fathers, and in my estimation, they just don’t want to be forgotten.” 
Thompson described himself as a “middleman” and a “foot soldier” of the department – connecting people with information about ALTSD and informing the people in the department who have authority to investigate issues or complaints. 
“We can only listen, record and report to the state ombudsman who has the authority to follow through and see what they could do to help these people,” he said. “A lot of the folks, their memories are not that great. They’ll talk to you and you don’t know if what they’re saying is accurate. That’s not your job to decide if it’s accurate or not. You just listen to what they have to say.”
But that in and of itself is important, he said.
“I just know what I’m there to do, which is bring a little joy and comfort to these folks that I talk to. And the fact that I’m a good listener, and I ask simple questions, I don’t want to make it complicated and the fact that I don’t assume anything is extremely helpful,” he said. “They don’t need to pay me to tell me what my value is. Seeing the looks on these people’s faces is the best validation that I could ask for…. I just hope there’s someone there for me when it’s my turn.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ombudsman-1024x819.png,,,2025-12-24 09:56:49.662295

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ failed proof of citizenship law could serve as a cautionary tale for Congress and other states just beginning to craft similar voting restrictions, a report found.
Federal legislation reintroduced earlier this year would require voters to provide documented proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. Kansas has been there, done that.
A report from three organizations, analyzing data from Kansas and Arizona, posits that such citizenship laws are costly, error-prone and disenfranchise voters. Plus, citizenship is already a requirement to vote nationwide.
Noncitizen voting is vanishingly rare, said Lata Nott, director of voting rights policy at the Campaign Legal Center and one of the report’s authors.
“We wrote this report to look into the actual financial costs of these laws, but, of course, there’s also the cost of — it’s a nonmonetary cost — people get disenfranchised by these laws, or you make it really hard for them to vote,” Nott said.
It was issued by Dēmos, a New York-based think tank focused on democracy; the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit legal group; and State Voices, an advocacy organization with state-based affiliates across the country.
The report used Kansas and Arizona as touchstones to illustrate the unforeseen financial costs of executing documentary proof of citizenship laws as they gain traction in Congress and statehouses nationwide.
The federal proof of citizenship law hasn’t progressed, but Indiana, New Hampshire, Ohio and Wyoming enacted legislation in 2025.
Kansas’ stint with a documentary proof of citizenship law was brief. After the passage of the Kansas Secure and Fair Elections, or SAFE, Act in 2011, every Kansan registering to vote was required to provide documentary proof of citizenship, which could include a passport or a birth certificate.
The law was implemented in 2013, and it was in effect for more than 3 years before a judge blocked its enforcement.
The report’s authors reviewed fiscal notes attached to documentary proof of citizenship legislation. Lawmakers often didn’t provide any fiscal analysis, ignore fiscal effects on local governments or provide incomplete fiscal analyses.
The report said Kansas’ fiscal note was an example of “gross underestimation” of state costs and burdens on local election officials. Lawmakers estimated a $12,500 increase in expenditures in the Secretary of State’s Office in fiscal year 2011 and a $1,000 increase in the following fiscal year.
In its first full fiscal year, the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office spent more than $192,000 to implement the act. The report hypothesizes the office spent more than $350,000 in total between the law’s passage and effective dates.
At the time, county election officials did not have access to systems that could crosscheck passport numbers or birth certificate records.
Neda Khoshkhoo, interim director of democracy at Dēmos and an author of the report, said proof of citizenship laws erect social barriers, and those barriers are tied to a chronic underfunding of this type of legislation.
“They, ultimately, are a form of voter suppression, which has a particular impact on voters of color and low-income voters and other historically marginalized groups,” Khoshkhoo said.
The disenfranchisement compounds, she said, when downstream effects of underfunding lead to incorrect implementation of a citizenship verification system, and voters are increasingly denied access to ballots.
The report said documentary proof of citizenship did not work in Kansas and came at the cost of disenfranchising thousands of voters and millions of dollars lost. 
Implementing proof of citizenship laws typically require investments in technology upgrades, staff training and data privacy, Nott said. Kansas tied its citizenship verification process to its driver’s license database.
“When you do that, you will probably run into some errors,” Nott said. “Kansas has. Arizona has. And those errors, they’re not just minor errors. They’re errors that disenfranchise people, that take away their right to vote.”
However the report identified a larger problem. Division of motor vehicles clerks in Kansas weren’t allowed, by policy, to request proof of citizenship from voters when renewing or updating their licenses. Clerks statewide also were not allowed to inform people of the new requirement. 
The report said Kansas “faced a multitude of technological, organizational and legal challenges that were a direct result of the flawed system designed by the SAFE Act and its implementing regulations and directives.”
More than 30,000 Kansans were prevented from voting and saw their registrations suspended or deemed invalid because of the state’s law.
The report said there was “a yearslong breakdown in communication and coordination between the DMV, the secretary of state, county election offices, and voters” throughout the duration of the law.
In 2018, a federal judge struck it down, ruling the law unconstitutional and in violation of the National Voter Registration Act. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judgment in 2020, concluding the law had an outsized effect on voters. It ruled that the inclusion of noncitizens on Kansas’ voter rolls could be attributed to administrative issues. A confirmed 39 noncitizens successfully registered to vote in Kansas between 1999 and 2013, making up 0.002% of voters, according to the appeals court’s opinion.
The full cost of ameliorating the state’s errors was not documented, the report said.
Proof of citizenship laws can sound like common sense policy, said Marissa Liebling, senior director of programs at State Voices. But the complications and the financial hurdles that come with enacting them amass.
Then-Secretary of State, now attorney general, Kris Kobach was an advocate of the law, billing it as a way to combat voter fraud. Instances of fraud were never proven in court.
The state ended up paying $1.9 million in attorneys’ fees to the winning parties of two lawsuits, the report said. Staff time in the Attorney General’s and Secretary of State’s offices spent on the litigation wasn’t unaccounted for in the report.
A spokesperson for the current Secretary of State’s Office said Kansas’ documentary proof of citizenship law “was a tool to help with the integrity of Kansas voter rolls.”
Secretary of State Scott Schwab, who is a Republican candidate for governor, was a member of the House at the time the citizenship law was passed. He voted in favor of passage, according to legislative records.
Liebling, Khoshkhoo and Nott expect more proof of citizenship laws in 2026.
Nott interprets their increase in popularity as “one of many signs that we’ve had in the past few years that election administration has gotten so politicized.”
What once was a domain for “wonky election nerds,” as Nott put it, has become polarized in every aspect. 
Liebling said voter education, fail-safe options for voters and proper, accurate investments are solutions to costly, error-prone election legislation. The effects of proof of citizenship laws can be acute and profound for people who have historically been excluded from electoral processes, she said, but the issue touches everyone.
“When you compound the fiscal and administrative costs with a real burden on voters in many different communities and geographies across the board,” Liebling said, “I think it really requires some rethinking as to the value of these kinds of policies.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_5361-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 09:56:49.662295

(Photo by LordHenriVoton/Getty Images)With the most wonderful — and for some, the most stressful — time of year underway, a University of Iowa researcher is working to discover pathways in the brain to help decrease the risks that come with chronic stress and promote resilience.
According to a 2023 poll conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Psychological Association, more than 40% of respondents reported their stress levels increasing during the holiday season, described in the report as the time between November and January.
Jason Radley, a UI psychological and brain sciences professor who has spent a decade studying the effects of chronic stress “from the perspective of disease,” said the stress responses developed in the body to help in enduring harsh environments are triggered in modern times by things that “aren’t really immediately life threatening, like work pressure or financial problems.”
“The effects of stress on the brain and body can produce long-lasting changes in brain function and the pathways that regulate behavior,” Radley said.

Radley’s research focuses on the reaction to stress, also known as coping, and how the brain controls how the body copes. In studying the stress hormone changes and manipulating brain activity in rats, Radley said he and researchers working with him have shown that the prefrontal cortex of the brain in these lab animals is “rewired by chronic stress exposure.”
The human’s prefrontal cortex is the area of the brain “most strongly associated with higher mental functioning,” Radley said, like the ability to focus on different tasks, plan and make decisions. Seeing how rats’ brains respond to chronic stress should help in understanding how it can rewire humans’ brains as well, and increase risks of stress-related diseases and other medical issues.
Two pathways connect the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem, Radley said. Research has shown the pathways regulate what he called “active and passive coping.” Radley described active coping as “taking steps to resolve or reduce the stress,” like confronting tasks causing stress, while passive coping “can be more like withdrawing from the situation or procrastinating.”
“What we found is that if we activate this pathway that can increase active coping after chronic stress, we can reverse these physical changes and the adverse effects that we see with stress hormones and cardiovascular changes,” Radley said.
With these pathways identified, Radley said he and other stress researchers have grown more interested in resilience as a tool of decreasing risk. Radley has created a “behavioral task” for lab rats which he said is similar to training that first responders receive or soldiers go through in basic training, though on a much smaller scale, where people are exposed to milder forms of stress so they can learn to adapt in real stressful situations.
The task, which Radley said some call a “model of stress inoculation,” will hopefully unlock for researchers new pathways that they can activate in people to help mitigate risks of developing stress-related disease and promote resiliency.
How to cope with high-stress holidays
From the research Radley and others have compiled on stress and the brain and body’s interaction with it, he said something people can take away is that active coping — or facing stressors head-on rather than avoiding them — will help reduce feelings of being overwhelmed.
A June article from the Centers for Disease Control recommends caring for both mind and body to reduce stress, including taking breaks from social media, doing relaxing activities, practicing gratitude, connecting with others, getting enough sleep, moving your body and eating healthfully.
When asked whether his knowledge of stress and resiliency has led to this — traditionally tricky — time of year being any more calm or easy, Radley joked that “stress researchers are really good at alleviating stress and living stress-free” just like how “all doctors are healthy and dentists have good teeth.”
While Radley said his default behavior leans more toward procrastination and last-minute work than not, conducting his research has led him to think more about how he can actively cope in stressful situations like holiday shopping or figuring out when to take time off work when “research never rests.”
He’s gotten good at “getting things done at deadlines” after pushing things back, Radley said, but he can feel physical effects of the stress caused by his habits, especially as he gets older.
“What I’ve been trying to do since I’ve been more mindful of our research with active coping is to try to plan better, and just try to do things little bit at a time and not wait till the last minute,” Radley said.

Sockeye salmon, also known as red salmon, is among the species harvested for subsistence. (Photo provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The U.S. Department of the Interior is considering whether to change Alaska’s unique system of hunting and fishing, which gives rural residents priority on federal land in Alaska.
According to a notice published Dec. 15 in the Federal Register, the Interior Department is conducting “a targeted review” of the program mandated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.
While no specific changes were identified in the notice, it prompted the Alaska Federation of Natives to react with concern.
In a message to members, it called the new proposal “a serious threat and a major step backward” in fish and game management within Alaska, according to a report Tuesday by the Anchorage Daily News.
Federal law requires rural residents to receive a priority when subsistence hunting and fishing, but because Alaska’s constitution prohibits the state from operating a system that gives one resident priority over another, the federal government uses one set of rules for hunting and fishing on federally controlled waters and lands, and the state uses another set for state-controlled water and land.
That has frequently led to conflicts between the state and federal government over management, and several lawsuits over the issue are currently in progress in federal court.
The Daily News reported that the suggestion to revise the two-tiered program came from Safari Club International, a large sport-hunting organization that has frequently sided with the state in lawsuits against the federal government.
Information posted online by the Interior Department indicates that the agency may consider:

Changing the makeup of the board that regulates subsistence hunting and fishing on federal land;
Reconsidering the rules that determine what parts of the state are “rural” and thus eligible for preferential treatment;
And the role of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in the program.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is taking a holiday break and will return to your inboxes on Monday, Jan. 5.
For five years, 39-year-old Sarah Jolly has been trying to start a family with her husband. After both participated in multiple tests, the Central Coast couple has yet to receive a clear-cut answer to their infertility issues. 
Throughout the ordeal, which has included three unsuccessful attempts of intrauterine insemination, Jolly said she has felt dismissed. Insurance also refused to cover any of her fertility tests or appointments, but covered her husband’s visit to a urologist. 

Jolly: “I’ve gotten a lot of comments societally, even from a lot of men, like ‘You should have kids. It’s the biggest privilege.’ But our society also doesn’t support women and getting the health care they need to be able to achieve that. It feels like a punch in the face that I wasn’t expecting.”

For Californians like Jolly who are struggling with infertility, some support is on the way. Beginning Jan. 1, certain health insurers will be required to cover fertility treatments and in vitro fertilization services, offering millions of Californians a chance to have a baby, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
The new law mandates large group health insurers — from employers with at least 100 workers — to cover fertility services, and does not apply to people who get their insurance through religious employers, federally regulated plans or Medi-Cal. The law also amends the definition of infertility to include same-sex couples and single people, opening up fertility benefits to these individuals.
In the U.S. roughly 9% of men and 11% of women of reproductive age struggle with infertility, and treatment can be costly: One cycle of in vitro fertilization costs an average of $24,000, according to a 2010 survey. For a successful pregnancy, which often takes multiple tries, the average cost was $61,000. These high price tags are the main reason people can’t access care, said Alise Powell, director of government affairs with RESOLVE: The National Fertility Association.

Powell: “Infertility is a disease and it should be covered by insurance like any other disease or ailment people have.”

Immigration fears color holiday season

Though 2025 marks the third year local organizers have put on a holiday festival in San Diego County’s San Marcos, heightened immigration enforcement activity has created an air of increased caution in the mostly low-income, Latino community, reports CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan.
Sponsored by the civic organization Universidad Popular in partnership with Restoration Abbey, a local church, the event includes a neighborhood procession, or posada, that reenacts the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem. As locals gather for the Posada Comunitaria event, however, volunteers keep watch for immigration agents — highlighting the challenges some community leaders face when planning cultural celebrations under the current Trump administration.
San Marcos appears to account for just a few of the immigration arrests in the San Diego area, but this year saw more arrests: Since September 2023, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested at least 38 people — but 20 of those arrests were between June and October 2025, according to a CalMatters’ analysis of federal data provided by ICE.
Despite the fears, organizers decided to go on with the show.

Alex Aguas, a priest with Restoration Abbey: “The practice of the Posada really invites people to think about … what does it mean to be on the margins and looking for sanctuary and shelter at this time?’ We also just get to have the opportunity to celebrate.”

(Photo courtesy of Iowa Department of Corrections)The Iowa Dental Board has reinstated the license of a Waterloo dentist convicted of being intoxicated at the state prison where he was providing dental care for inmates.
State records show that in December 2023, Paymun Bayati, also identified in board records as Payum Bayati, was arrested at Anamosa State Penitentiary shortly after completing a root canal on a patient inmate. Bayati was charged with public intoxication and was convicted in April 2024. He subsequently agreed to voluntarily surrender his license for at least one year.
Police records show that on Dec. 7, 2023, an Anamosa police officer was dispatched to the penitentiary in reference an impaired person who was trying to drive away from the prison. The officer reported arriving at the prison and meeting with the warden, the deputy warden and Bayati.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the police report, the warden said nurses reported Bayati appeared to be intoxicated and had just completed a root canal on a patient. The police officer reported Bayati’s speech was slurred and he “smelled heavily” of alcohol. Bayati then submitted to a test that allegedly indicated a blood-alcohol level of 0.158 — almost twice the legal limit for driving.
“He let me search his vehicle in the parking lot, where I located an empty flask that smelled of an alcoholic beverage,” the police officer wrote in his report.
Court records, which include the judge’s notes from the ensuing criminal trial, indicate the dental assistant who worked with Bayati testified that when she arrived for work on Dec. 7, 2023, Bayati had music playing on a computer and his head was resting on the counter. The trial notes indicate she testified that later, while doing the root canal, Bayati was swaying back and forth, closing his eyes, had trouble picking up dental instruments, and smelled of alcohol.
The judge’s notes also indicate the administrator of nursing testified that after she told Bayati he could not work and instructed him to gather his belongings, he told her he loved her and asked if he still had a job. She also testified that Bayati was staggering at one point, seemed confused and was laughing inappropriately, according to the judge’s notes.
“I don’t dispute that I was intoxicated,” Bayati testified, according to the judge’s notes. “How it came about is what I am arguing. Someone poisoned me.”
Bayati told the Iowa Capital Dispatch he doesn’t drink and believed someone, probably his dental assistant, tampered with his cup of coffee by pouring isopropyl alcohol into it after he arrived at the prison that morning.
In December 2024, six months after his license suspension took effect, Bayati sought early reinstatement of his license. After the board indicated it intended to deny that request, Bayati sought a hearing before the board.
As part of his request, Bayati provided the board with a substance abuse evaluation that didn’t recommend treatment and didn’t include a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Bayati also informed the board that he is subject to some form of additional substance-use monitoring by virtue of his holding a commercial pilot’s license and a commercial driver’s license as part of his trucking business.
Last month, the board concluded that Bayati had demonstrated it was in the public’s best interest to have his license reinstated, subject either to enrollment in the Iowa Professional Health Program or to three years of substance monitoring by the board.
Other Iowa dentists sanctioned
Other Iowa dentists whose disciplinary cases recently came before the board include:
Deborah Cassill of Cedar Rapids – According to the board, Cassill was alleged to have allowed uncertified dental assistant trainees to take patient radiographs and perform dental work without supervision by a dentist. It was also alleged that Cassill had “rushed a patient’s dental work” and that the patient was one of her own employees.
The board, which has not disclosed when the alleged conduct took place, charged Cassill with encouraging, assisting, or enabling the unauthorized practice of dentistry, and with unprofessional conduct. To resolve the case, Cassill agreed to pay a $2,000 civil penalty and complete an “ethics program” of undefined duration.
It is the second time the board has sanctioned Cassill for improper use of staff to perform dental work.
In 1999, the board charged Cassill, then known as Deborah Trimble, with assisting or enabling the unauthorized practice of dentistry and with willfully or repeatedly violating a board rule in that she failed to protect the health of her patients by assigning unlicensed auxiliary staff duties that could not be legally delegated to them.
In that case, the board alleged Cassill regularly employed “unlicensed auxiliary staff” as dental assistants, and on many occasions allowed a dental assistant to perform procedures – including the placement and removal of temporary crowns — that constituted the practice of dentistry or dental hygiene. The case was resolved with Cassill’s license being placed on probation for five years, with the understanding that she’d complete a course on dental ethics and pay a $1,500 civil penalty.
Maria Nosworthy of Ottumwa – According to the board, it fielded a complaint about Nosworthy that expressed several areas of concern with her practice of dentistry, including “using force with patients,” an allegation on which the board didn’t elaborate.
The board alleges the complaint also expressed concern with regard to Nosworthy’s failure to meet infection-control standards, working on patients after they have asked her to stop, improper use of local anesthesia, failure to perform comprehensive patient examinations, poor communication with patients, failure to meet the expected standard of care, and unprofessionalism.
The available board documents don’t indicate when any of the alleged conduct took place.
The board charged Nosworthy with practicing dentistry in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public, unprofessional or unethical conduct, and failure to maintain a satisfactory standard of competency.
Without agreeing to any wrongdoing, Nosworthy recently agreed to settlement that calls for her to complete a remedial education program that deals with restorative care, ethics and recordkeeping.
No civil penalties or restrictions on Nosworthy’s license were imposed.

State and local governments became more aggressive in sweeping homeless encampments in 2025, among other measures. 


In 2025, we started to see the effects of a more punitive approach to homelessness from the state and local governments.
A CalMatters investigation found that the number of people arrested or cited for homelessness-related offenses soared in cities around the state. At least 50 California cities passed new ordinances targeting homeless encampments, according to an analysis by UC Berkeley Law students. That all came after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year in Grants Pass v. Johnson, which gave cities more freedom to punish people for sleeping in public spaces.
Gov. Gavin Newsom doubled down in encouraging cities to crack down on people living outdoors. In May, he urged every local government in the state to adopt ordinances that restrict public camping. In August, he launched a new state taskforce dedicated to clearing encampments.
2025 was also the year that some California counties finally started to make progress on homelessness, which experts attributed to an influx over the past few years in state, federal and local funds for housing and services. Of the 29 places in California that reported an official homeless census, more than half saw fewer unhoused people compared to 2024, according to an analysis of point-in-time counts by the Hub for Urban Initiatives. Contra Costa, Sonoma, Santa Cruz, Ventura, San Diego and Los Angeles were among the counties that saw their numbers go down.
2026 outlook
Cuts, cuts and more cuts. Proposed federal cuts to housing and homelessness funds, as well as a shift in federal funding away from permanent housing, could derail the progress California has made in fighting homelessness. The state also is reducing the money it contributes to homeless housing and services.
At the same time, the federal administration is signalling that it will divert funds away from states, cities and organizations that support undocumented immigrants, diversity and inclusion efforts and the transgender community. Some California homeless service providers worry that could put them at risk of losing federal dollars.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/111524_Anatomy-Of-A-Sweep-JK_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 08:56:35.940534

A new law aims to help change that.,"In summary
In vitro fertilization costs thousands of dollars and is often too expensive for many people struggling to conceive. A new law aims to help change that. 


When Megan Meo, 36, and her husband decided to start a family, they knew they wanted two kids. They didn’t know they would have to endure multiple rounds of fertility treatment, causing much heartache and draining away thousands of dollars.
“It’s strange when my body isn’t working to do a thing it was made for,” Meo said. ”It hurts me at my core.”
Meo is among roughly 9 million Californians who will benefit from a new law requiring some insurers to pay for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility. On Jan. 1, large group health insurers in California — from employers with at least 100 workers — will be required to begin covering fertility preservation and in vitro fertilization services.
The law also redefines infertility in state statute, eliminating an exemption that prevented same-sex couples or single people from receiving fertility benefits.
The law does not apply to people who get their insurance through religious employers, federally regulated plans or Medi-Cal. Last month, a settlement in a class action lawsuit led by a Santa Clara couple required Aetna to extend fertility benefits to LGBTQ couples nationwide.
Advocates expect small group insurers will soon be required to offer the same coverage through a separate regulatory process that awaits federal approval. Once federal officials approve that process, most Californians with employer-sponsored health insurance should receive the benefit, said Sen. Caroline Menjivar, the law’s author and a Democrat from Van Nuys.
“I am so proud of this bill. I want this bill on my tombstone,” Menjivar said. “This impacts so many people from single people to heterosexual couples.”
Menjivar, who is lesbian, said the new law strikes a personal chord. For her to have children, she would have to rely on fertility treatments – and insurance companies have often excluded LGBTQ individuals from coverage for these services. One of her friends spent more than $20,000 on fertility treatments to have three children, she said.
“This brings into the fold a lot of people,” Menjivar said, tearing up. “I get emotional because I know these people. I know what this looked like for my friends.”
High cost prevents people from using IVF
In vitro fertilization, or IVF, commonly helps people struggling to conceive. About 9% of men and 11% of women of reproductive age struggle with infertility in the U.S. During a cycle of IVF, doctors retrieve eggs from the ovaries and fertilize them with sperm in a lab. The resultant embryos can then be transferred to the uterus.
The process, while simple sounding, can take months or even years before a successful pregnancy. It is also expensive. A 2010 survey on the cost for infertility treatment among 400 Northern California women found the average payment for one cycle of IVF was $24,000. The average cost for a successful pregnancy, which can take multiple cycles, was $61,000. Health care costs have grown since then. 
Before insurance coverage kicked in, Meo’s fertility clinic told her one round of IVF would cost between $30,000 and $39,000.
“The idea of spending $40,000 on something that might not work was really scary,” she said. She and her husband have been trying to start a family for two years. Her infertility is partially related to uterine scarring left by a previous miscarriage. Insurance coverage lessens the emotional and financial burden for them, Meo said. 
Alise Powell, director of government affairs with RESOLVE: The National Fertility Association, said cost is the No.1 barrier preventing people from accessing care. Congress has on multiple occasions shot down legislative efforts to require health insurers to cover fertility services, most recently in 2024. California is the 15th state to mandate coverage for state-regulated plans.
“Infertility is a disease and it should be covered by insurance like any other disease or ailment people have,” Powell said.
Jamie Falls, 44, has been trying to get pregnant for 11 years. She and her husband, who had an unsuccessful vasectomy reversal, took out a loan to afford the $13,000 it cost for one round of IVF in 2020. The procedure didn’t work. They’ve been saving since then to try another round. 
Insurance coverage offers some relief, Falls said, but after trying for so long it almost seems too good to be true. 
“I wouldn’t wish this journey on anybody. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through (but) I can’t picture myself not being a mom,” Falls said.
Health insurers who opposed the law before it was enacted have said it will raise overall insurance costs, pinching small businesses and people who buy individual policies.
Infertility often unexplained
Many people who struggle to conceive don’t know why they are unable to do so. Studies indicate around 30% are diagnosed with unexplained infertility. 
It’s a frustrating diagnosis, said Sarah Jolly, 39, who has been trying to conceive with her husband for five years. Tests to check her ovarian reserve, hormone levels and ensure there were no blockages came back normal. The couple even sought out a urologist who specializes in male infertility to run tests on Jolly’s husband only for everything to return clean.
The couple has tried intrauterine insemination — a process where sperm is inserted directly into the uterus while a woman is ovulating — three times without a pregnancy.
Jolly said she and her husband are keeping IVF on the table as a last resort, but she doesn’t want to go through with a procedure without knowing what it’s treating. 
Recently, after seeking out another specialist, Jolly learned that she had endometriosis, a chronic condition that can cause adhesions, scarring and inflammation around the reproductive organs. Multiple doctors had previously told Jolly endometriosis had nothing to do with her infertility, she said, but the specialist told her it was a common – and treatable – reason. 
Studies suggest between 30% to 50% of women with endometriosis are infertile, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 
Jolly said throughout this process she has felt unheard and undervalued, constantly having to advocate for more testing and more answers. Insurance also refused to pay for any of her fertility tests or appointments, but covered her husband’s visit to the urologist. 
“I’ve gotten a lot of comments societally, even from a lot of men, like ‘You should have kids. It’s the biggest privilege.’ But our society also doesn’t support women and getting the health care they need to be able to achieve that,” Jolly said. “It feels like a punch in the face that I wasn’t expecting. I really thought it would be a much more supportive process medically.”

,California,2025-12-24 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Even more Cal State campuses will automatically admit eligible students under a new state law,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/12/cal-state-admission/,California State University last year launched a pilot program to attract more students to the university system and to steer some to campuses that have been struggling with enrollment declines.,"In summary
California State University last year launched a pilot program to attract more students to the university system and to steer some to campuses that have been struggling with enrollment declines. 


What’s good for Riverside County is good for the whole state: After a pilot to automatically admit high school students into the California State University system in the Inland Empire county took off last fall, lawmakers this year passed a law to greenlight a similar program statewide next fall. 
Leaders at the California State University last year launched the pilot to attract more students to the university system and to steer some to campuses that have been struggling with enrollment declines.
The pilot worked like this: University officials and high schools in Riverside County pored over student course completion and grade data to identify every county high school senior who was eligible for admission to the 10 of 22 Cal State campuses chosen for the pilot. Then the students received a brochure in the mail last fall before the Nov. 30 submission deadline, plus digital correspondence, telling them they were provisionally admitted as long as they submitted an application to one or more Cal State campuses, even those not in the pilot, and maintained their high school grades.Starting next fall, all students in California will be eligible for the automatic admissions program, which will expand the roster of participating Cal State campuses to 16. Cal State will release more information on the program’s implementation in February, its website says.
In justifying the expanded program during a legislative hearing, bill author Sen. Christopher Cabaldon, a Democrat from Napa, said college should be as seamless a transition from high school as it is for students finishing one grade and advancing to the next. “It’s entirely an invention of us, the gap between 12th grade and college. … The same gap does not exist between elementary school and junior high or junior high and high school.”The legislation, Senate Bill 640, passed without any opposition and was signed into law by the governor. The program doesn’t mean students can enter any major at the campuses they pick. Some majors may require students to show higher high school grades or tougher courses if those programs have fewer openings than student demand. For Californians, the standard minimum GPA for entry is 2.5 in a series of college-preperatory courses.Students will also be free to apply to the six other  over-enrolled Cal State campuses, though admission isn’t guaranteed. Those are Fullerton, Long Beach, Pomona, San Diego, San Jose and San Luis Obispo.
What the Riverside pilot did
High school counselors told CalMatters that the Riverside County pilot encouraged students who never considered attending a university to follow through with the automatic admissions process. Counselors also reached out to some students who were a class or two short of meeting the requirements for Cal State admission to take those, encouraging more students to apply to college who otherwise wouldn’t have. Younger students who were off the college-course taking track might be emboldened to enroll in those tougher high school courses knowing automatic admission is in the cards, the counselors said.
Silvia Morales, a senior at Heritage High School, a public Riverside County high school, got an automatic admissions letter last fall. “I was pretty set on going to community college and then transferring, because I felt like I wasn’t ready for the four-year commitment to a college,” she said. She eventually submitted her forms, encouraged by her high school counselor. 
Following the Riverside pilot, Cal State campuses saw roughly 1,500 more applicants and 1,400 more admitted students in 2025 compared to 2024, though just 136 more students enrolled. 
The data for Riverside County reviewed by CalMatters suggests that more applicants and admitted students through an automatic admissions policy doesn’t translate into more enrolled students. Colleges closely follow their “yield rates” — the percentage of admitted students who ultimately enroll. In 2024, the Cal State yield rate for Riverside County was about a third. But in 2025, it declined by a few percentage points, meaning a lower share of admitted students selected any Cal State campus.  
This suggests that the system will have to work harder to convert admitted students into ones who actually enroll, said Iwunze Ugo, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, particularly with students who would not have applied were it not for the automatic admissions program.
Automatic admissions doesn’t mean automatic enrollment
While admission to a college overcomes a major hurdle to eventually enrolling, there are numerous steps necessary before students sit down for their first college course. Accepted students must submit additional grades, put down a deposit, complete registration forms and actually show up for the fall term. Students who were less engaged in the college-going culture are more likely to “melt” during the process between acceptance and enrollment, some studies show, though researchers say this can be reversed with additional outreach to students at risk of not enrolling. 
And even with an automatic admissions program, students must still register online and complete the application, which many students under the Riverside pilot didn’t do. Cal State sent out more than 17,000 automatic admissions notices to students, and just under 12,000 formally applied to at least one Cal State campus. Those who didn’t apply may have chosen another option, such as the often more selective University of California, private campuses, community colleges, or no college at all.“I think that’ll be incumbent on the CSU to pick up some of that slack and encourage students admitted through this path to go through the rest of the process and ultimately end up at a CSU campus,” Ugo said.Cal State officials also recognize this. “Students who apply independently tend to have stronger self-directed interest, and therefore stronger intent to enroll,” said April Grommo, a senior Cal State official who oversees enrollment management. More direct engagement with students admitted through this program will be necessary, she said.
Some campuses with a recent history of declining enrollment got a tiny pick-up from the pilot. San Francisco State saw 311 more applications from Riverside County in 2025 than in 2024. That translated to 11 more enrolled students, a review of Cal State data shows.
A statewide program may steer more students to attend campuses with enrollment woes, even if the “yield rate” declines. That’s because if the rate of new students enrolling doesn’t rise as quickly as the number of students admitted, the yield rate drops.Under the expanded statewide program, Grommo said the system anticipates “enrollment growth as well, but not necessarily at the same rate as applications and admits,” she added.And as the economy shows signs of decay, the prospect of a college degree may compel more high schoolers on the fence to attend Cal State; System data show students from there earn a typical salary of $71,000 five years after graduating with a bachelor’s degree. Postsecondary enrollment tends to rise as the number of available jobs decreases, a social science phenomenon in which employers are more selective about who they hire, compelling many job-seekers to hit the books to show they’re more trained.Of course, souring economies often result in less public funding for colleges as state budgets are beleaguered, which may lead to fewer professors and staff for a growing cadre of students. “But I think generally, having more students is not a problem,” Ugo said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/050625_CSU-San-Marcos_AH_CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 08:56:35.940534

Maybe it was the surprise success of a book about permitting reform among liberal elites. Maybe it was just the cumulative crush of California’s unaffordability. 
Whatever the cause, 2025 was the year that California’s Democratic lawmakers finally got serious about building. 
In the summer, state lawmakers passed a law exempting most urban apartment developments from the threat of environmental litigation. A few months later, they passed a bill green-lighting apartment buildings near major public transit stops over local objections. Both bills are aimed at pushing the state to build its way out of a chronic housing shortage, both are longtime items on the “Yes in my backyard” movement’s wishlist and both were gleefully signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Other, less high-profile legislation aimed at speeding up construction also sailed through both chambers this year.
Let the era of abundant housing begin? Probably not. This year’s historic policy shift may push in that direction, but high interest rates, unpredictable tariffs and lofty labor costs are pushing in the other. Plus, it just takes a long time to build stuff.
Despite the boom year in pro-construction bills, it was a bit of a legislative bust for those seeking immediate help with the cost of housing. The legislative year didn’t offer much for existing renters. Nor did it take up a proposed bond measure meant to top-up one of the state’s affordable housing funds. Though affordable housing producers secured a long-sought-after boost in federal support from President Trump’s signature spending bill, the administration also aims to slash spending on permanent housing for the homeless. 
2026 outlook 
That all gives lawmakers plenty to pick back up in 2026. The question of whether to take the bond back up in time for the November election is likely to dominate the debate in January. YIMBYs aim to push forward more cost-cutting measures for development and tenant rights group will likely call again for tighter rent caps and tenant protections. But as Election Day nears, the appetite for controversial votes tends to wane.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/020624_No-Place-Like-Home_CC_CM_25.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 08:56:35.940534

“We have reached 67 degrees on more than one occasion already this month in Salt Lake City,” said Alex DeSmet, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, “and that ties for the second-warmest December and also second-warmest winter temperature ever recorded.”
Monday’s minimum temperature was 59 degrees as well, DeSmet said “which broke the previous warmest overnight temperature in the winter by 7 degrees. So quite, quite significant there.”
And, the odds of having a typical snow-filled Christmas Day in the Salt Lake Valley is “basically 0%,” according to DeSmet. But, 6 to 12 inches of snow are expected on the mountains above 8,500 feet Wednesday through Thursday night.
Wednesday night through Friday night, the National Weather Service is also expecting high winds with gusts up to 50 miles per hour in western Utah and Tooele Valley, potentially impacting holiday travel, since high winds may blow dust. 
However, temperatures are expected to stop breaking records by Friday, DeSmet said.
Great Salt Lake is rising again, but it’s going to need a ‘really big’ winter to avoid concerns

The state’s ski resorts have experienced slow season beginnings, with skiers reporting soft, spring-like snow, according to ABC4. Tourists in town hoping for a powder day have also been dismayed.
The lack of snow has Utahns worried about potentially seeing worse drought levels, since about 95% of the state’s water supply comes from snowpack. Concern is especially high after a dry summer that left Great Salt Lake managers hoping for a strong winter for the basin. 
But, “there’s a lot of winter left, fortunately,” DeSmet said, and there’s time to build the snowpack on the mountains until April, which is what’s typical for the season.
While the National Weather Service estimates temperatures will remain warmer than normal through the rest of the winter, that won’t necessarily be reflected in the snowpack.
“As far as the precipitation is concerned, it’s kind of a weaker signal. It can go either way for most of the rest of the winter,” DeSmet said.

“In general, states in the southeastern U.S. provided contraceptive care to larger shares of female Medicaid enrollees through health departments than in other parts of the country,” the report read.
The usage of public health departments for contraceptives, the report said, is due to Alabama’s network of Title X clinics being all public health departments. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Title X clinics are federally funded family planning clinics.
The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) offers family planning services like counseling for contraceptives, pap smears for women, testing for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases and infections, according to its website. Every county has a public health department where these services are offered.
“Depending on how small the county is or the population, we might not have those services available every day in every county, but every week or every month,” Harris said.
Alabama State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said in a recent interview that public health departments help fill the gap, especially in rural areas.
“Many of our rural areas are health care deserts, and we’re one of the few providers there, along with community health centers,” Harris said. “I think those are the ones who are plugging most of the gaps.”
The county health departments are not always equipped to handle every need that comes to them, Harris said, but that is where community health centers, or federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), come in. 
According to the KFF report, 8% of Alabama Medicaid enrollees got contraceptives from community health centers in 2023. The national average for this category is 18%, according to the report. 
“Community health centers have historically served much smaller volumes of contraceptive clients, and it is estimated they would have to increase their contraceptive client caseloads by 56% to make up for the loss of Planned Parenthood clinics as a site of care for Medicaid enrollees,” the report reads. 
Those centers are operated by the federal government and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Harris said. 
Harris said he was not surprised by the make up of resources Alabama Medicaid enrollees use.
“It’s clearly a core priority for us to make sure those services are available so we have family planning programs in every county,” Harris said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Birth-control-blister-pack-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 08:11:41.069591

Instead, the Department of the Interior said that the new round of days will be “resident-only patriotic fee-free days.”
The newest line-up of fee-free days include Flag Day, June 14, which is also President Donald Trump’s birthday. It also includes former President Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday on Oct. 27.
Another change will be an increased fee system for out-of-country tourists. The fee-free days will not apply to out-of-country visitors.
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum explained the changes:
“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” Burgum said in a news release. “These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”
Earlier this month, a public lands group sued the Trump administration for removing a photograph of Montana’s Glacier National Park on an annual pass as it was swapped for a collage portrait of George Washington and Trump.
The Trump administration pushed back saying that the Glacier Park photograph would be used on national park passes for non-U.S. citizens, while the more common resident passes would contain Washington and Trump.

She got to engage with a world foreign to her own, she fondly recalled, playing in the fields, fishing and foraging.
“Even though I am truly a city child, every spot of countryness I could find, I gravitated towards it,” she said. 
Decades later, Bowden now owns one of the south Delta’s most well-known institutions, the Onward Store along U.S. 61, or the “blues highway,” in Sharkey County. Over the last century, the business has worn a number of hats: restaurant, gas station, post office, gift shop. The store also boasts a claim to fame most Mississippians are familiar with.

Just down the road, in 1902, then-president Theodore Roosevelt ventured on a bear hunt with Holt Collier, an esteemed marksman and former slave. After the president had little to show for the outing, Collier cornered a bear to give Roosevelt an easy shot. But, as the legend goes, Roosevelt considered the maneuver “unsportsmanlike,” and instead let the bear run free. News of the trip reached a toymaker in New York, and the popular Teddy Bear spread from there. 
Bowden retired in 2021 from her job of nearly 20 years, teaching theater to middle and high schoolers in Maryland. When the COVID-19 pandemic shrunk her usual classroom into a computer screen, her joy quickly faded, she said. 
She originally moved to Mississippi in 2023 to take care of the 320-acre farm her great grandfather bought years and years ago, located just south of Mayersville in the south Delta – or, as she described, “in the middle of nowhere.” 
But about a year later, Bowden drove past the Onward Store and saw a “for sale” sign posted outside. Right there and then, she found her new calling. 
In a rural area with scant economic growth and where it can take hours of driving to find groceries, the store is much more than a historical maker. It’s a nexus for locals and travelers to refresh, replenish and reunite.

Even more crucial for Bowden, reviving the business – which has been closed since January, 2024 – means reconnecting herself with a community her family left its mark on. 
On the same farm where her mother, aunts and uncles grew up, her grandfather, Henry Sias, hosted Civil Rights icons Fannie Lou Hamer and Stokely Carmichael, Bowden said. Sias also headed the local “colored” school. Her family, she added, took part in the 1960s Freedom Rides, and even joined Hamer when she gave her famous speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. Bowden’s cousin, she said, had to drive Hamer around because she couldn’t drive herself. 
“That’s part of my family history as far as I’m concerned,” she said.   
While it wasn’t the case when her family bought the property, the land is now one of the few Black-owned farms in the heavily agricultural area, Bowden added. 
The journey to reopen the Onward Store hasn’t been cheap. Even with the help of a couple of loans, buying and renovating the shop, including tearing up rotted floors, have drained her entire savings.
“I would say that I’ve bet my future on this store,” said Bowden, now 62.

Unsure how soon she’ll have her full vision of the store ready, Bowden is hoping to at least have the deli open by the end of 2025. There, she plans to serve a variety of lunch staples, especially local classics: hoop cheese, crawfish salad, egg salad, bologna salad, hogshead cheese and pimento loaf. 
But she also wants to transform the Onward Store, which she said had become somewhat of a tourist trap over the years, into something new. Bowden wants to add books and photographs showcasing the local blues culture, for instance. After all, she said, Muddy Waters grew up just around the corner. 
And in addition to selling hunting supplies and retro toys – yes, including the Teddy Bear – Bowden wants the Onward Store to serve as a vehicle for local goods, like vegetables and crafts. In an area with few jobs, she hopes her investment in the space can encourage and support other local business owners. 
Since she started repairs on the store a few months ago, visitors have constantly walked in, hoping it was finally open. Not yet, Bowden would tell them, but she would take their phone number down to let them know when it’s time to return. 
“ The community really wants to see it happen, and I want to make it happen for them,” she said. “Ever since I first started looking at this place, it’s been like a mission, and I think of it as my sacred duty to have this place where people can gather and have good food and conversation and everything. That is important.”

While it’s taken some acclimating to the rural lifestyle, Bowden said she’s found her happiness in Mississippi that went away during the pandemic. 
“We (up North) have some pretty bad opinions about (Mississippi), some of them are real, but a lot of them are not,” she said. “Beyond the notorious things about here, there is absolute beauty. I have found peace since I’ve been down here living on the family farm. That has been awesome.
“I can go out on my porch and look up in the sky and see the Milky Way at night. I could never do that in Washington, D.C. There’s such beauty here and there’s peace and there’s some good people here.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/28040314/Onward-Store-1.jpg,,,2025-12-24 08:11:41.069591

Republicans have lost all of them.
Yes, Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei was reelected every time over those years. But this is a look at competitive federal races. The Nevada 2nd congressional district Amodei represents is so safely red the Democrats didn’t even bother to run a candidate against him last year.
Nevada’s 1st congressional district, home of the fabulous Las Vegas Strip, was the mirror opposite of CD2 in 2016, 2018, and 2020, when Nevada Democratic Rep. Dina Titus easily defeated what amounted to token opposition.
But in 2022 and 2024, after Democratic legislators redistricted CD1 to buck up Democratic strength in CD3 and CD4, Titus’ district became competitive as well.
Upshot: In the last five campaign cycles from 2016 through 2024, there have been 16 competitive federal races,  four for the U.S. Senate (in 2016, 2018, 2022, and 2024) and a dozen for U.S. House seats. Republicans lost all of them.

 
One of the most formidable of those losing Republican candidates was Joe Heck, a three-term member of the U.S. House who ran against a former Nevada attorney general, Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, to succeed U.S. Sen. Harry Reid in 2016.
Heck had endorsed, if only perfunctorily, his party’s nominee for president that year, Trump. After the Access Hollywood tape, Heck, like many Republicans, recoiled in disgust, and he unendorsed Trump. It then appeared that Trump’s base was rejecting Heck because Heck had rejected Trump. Late in the campaign Heck started going wobbly on his un-endorsement of Trump, and wouldn’t say who he was voting for. In the end, Heck and Trump both lost Nevada.
Perhaps the most dramatic of all the Trump-era Republican losses for federal office in Nevada came two years later in 2018. Early in Trump’s first term, when Trump was trying to repeal Obamacare, Nevada Republican U.S. Sen. Dean Heller balked, then dithered. That led to Trump publicly humiliating him. Heller began sucking up to Trump, and voted for a so-called “skinny repeal” of Obamacare after all. And that in turn led to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen running ads casting Heller as an inflatable tube man blowing whichever way the wind took him (one of the best political ads of 21st century Nevada, by the way). 
Over the years, the more Trump has consolidated his command and control of the Republican Party nationally and in Nevada, the weaker and less accomplished have been the Republican candidates for federal office in the state.
And in all the competitive races for federal office that Republicans have lost, Nevada Democrats have tied those Republicans to Trump early and often.
Because it works. Nevada Democrats have a pristine track record spanning the last five campaign cycles to prove it.
Past performance, future results, etc.
An NPR/Newshour/Marist poll released last week found Trump’s approval rating on the economy is 36%, the lowest that particular poll has ever found in either of his madcap occupations of the White House. 
And that’s actually better, for Trump, than an AP/NORC poll earlier this month that found only 31% of respondents approve of his handling of the economy, similarly an all-time low for that poll. 
Those two polls echo a slew of other polls lately that find majorities of voters having roughly the same opinion of Trump that South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed on the Senate floor in the wee hours of January 7, 2021: “Count me out. Enough is enough.”
Starting with  the 2016 campaign cycle, Trump’s first, Democratic candidates for federal office have benefited greatly not only by the offensiveness of Trump’s general Trumpyness. They’ve also successfully run against him, er, Nevada Republican candidates, by focusing on issues where Trump has polled poorly, usually health care.
In 2026, they’ll have health care again, as well as the infuriating cost of living. They’ll be counting on the electorate’s dissatisfaction with Trump to do much of their work for them, allowing them to navigate their way to victories running as the lesser of two evils. 
This year, Nevada Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate have responded to the threat posed by Trump’s assaults on democracy, the Constitution, and the rule of law mostly by hunkering down in mushy centrism and saying “bipartisan” a lot. That suggests the Democratic campaign playbook in 2026 will be much the same as it’s been for the last decade: try not to offend anyone (including of course donors), play it safe, and let their Republican opponents sink under the weight of the Trump’s endorsements.
In other words, Nevada Democrats, and their fellow Democrats running for Congress nationwide, might win an election about the economy in 2026 while saying nothing particularly significant about the economy except that Trump blew it. 
By letting the electorate’s dissatisfaction with Trump do their work for them, Democrats would yet again be absolving themselves of confronting a warped marketplace and K-shaped economy that, over decades and thanks in very large part to to all that aforementioned bipartisanship, has grown more unapologetically harsh and unforgivingly predatory.
In thrall to centrism, Democrats seem to believe a normalcy of some sort will eventually be restored, so their most prudent course is cautious incrementalism, despite its failure in 2024 to to energize portions of a hitherto reliable base and a Democratic Party approval rating “lower than the Dead Sea.”
And in that string of Nevada Democratic victories in federal races since Trump came down his escalator, some of those victories have been by only the slimmest of margins over patently weak Republican candidates.
What might be Democratic wishful thinking notwithstanding, the forces that coughed up Trump and Trumpism aren’t going away any time soon. The more Democrats stiff-arm ambitious reforms, the more risk that voters will embrace the wild-eyed right, or just stop voting, and the more fragile the republic’s defense against authoritarian lawlessness.
Trump may sink Republican congressional candidates in Nevada yet again in 2026. But in addition to pointing at something obvious for voters to be against, Democrats have an opportunity, even an obligation, to articulate meaningful systemic change that voters can be for.
If past performance is any indication of future results, they’ll take a pass.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/trump-in-minden-campaign-video.jpg,,,2025-12-24 08:11:41.069591

Wes Moore signed an executive order protecting gender-affirming care in Maryland on June 5, 2023. (Photo courtesy the Governor's Office)Maryland joined 18 states and the District of Columbia Tuesday in a lawsuit challenging a Health and Human Services declaration last week that health care facilities offering gender-affirming care to minors would be barred from Medicare and Medicaid.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Oregon, claims that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. exceeded his authority with the Dec. 18 declaration, which would “effectively ban, by fiat, an entire caregory of healthcare.” It also failed to follow proper procedures for promulgating new rules, would  interfere with states’ rights to run their Medicaid programs and regulate health care and deny care to youth that need it.
“Healthcare decisions should be made by doctors and patients – not by politicians in Washington threatening to destroy providers’ careers and spreading fear among transgender youth and their families,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement late Tuesday night.
“This isn’t just about following the law – though HHS is clearly violating it. This is about protecting vulnerable young people who deserve the same dignity, respect, and access to medical care as anyone else,” Brown’s statement said.
For many of the 20 Democrat-led jurisdictions on Tuesday’s lawsuit, like Maryland, it was the second day in a row they had gone to an Oregon federal court to challenge Trump administration policy: A total of 22 jurisdictions sued Monday in an attempt to block the administration’s attempt to defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Brown compiles ‘voluminous’ record of legal challenges to Trump administration policies

Many of the states are now veterans of lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his administration. For Brown, this week’s lawsuits were the 47th and 48th against the administration and its policies since January, when Trump returned to office.
The latest lawsuit is a response to Kennedy’s declaration on the “Safety, Effectiveness, and Professional Standards of Care for Sex-Rejecting Procedures on Children and Adolescents.” That document declared that health care facilities would be barred from participating in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs if they provided gender-affirming care — including puberty blockers, hormonal treatments or surgery — to anyone under age 18.
Part of the declaration states that the methods “for children and adolescents are neither safe nor effective as a treatment modality for gender dysphoria, gender incongruence, or other related disorders in minors.” The declaration also says it supersedes “statewide or national standards of care.”
In a news release with the announcement, Kennedy said it was made in line with Trump’s Jan. 28 executive order “protecting children from chemical and surgical mutilation.” The release also notes that the Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to 12 manufacturers and retailers it says are marketing breast binders to children for treatment of gender dysphoria, and that HHS’ Office for Civil Rights is working to reverse a Biden administration policy that categorized gender dysphoria as a disability.
Tuesday’s suit claims that Kennedy’s declaration would negatively impact transgender youth, affect thousands of hospitals that offer Medicare and Medicaid programs and harm medical profession that provide necessary health care.
“The Kennedy Declaration also purports to establish a standard of care and supersede other standards of care, despite the Medicare statute’s clear prohibition against any Federal interference,” according to the suit.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The 41-page suit also discusses policies and protections for transgender youth in each of the state suing. In Maryland, it noted, the Trans Health Equity Act became law in 2023, stating that the state’s Medicaid program “shall” cover gender-affirming care that grants lower-income residents access to those procedures. The law also ensures the state provides the care with or without federal funding.
The state Department of Health reports that in 2024, Maryland Medicaid spent $1.7 million to fund more than 1,600 unique office visits for gender-affirming care services. That figure currently includes about $900,000 in federal funding.
“We’re standing up against this cruel and unlawful action because every Marylander, regardless of who they are, deserves compassionate, evidence-based healthcare from providers who won’t be punished for doing what’s right,” Brown said in his statement.
Besides the District and Maryland, other states in Tuesday’s suit include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvanis, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/moore_genderaffirmingcare_execorder-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 07:57:46.854950

Scott’s silence fuels immigration chaos — and harms Vermonters.","This commentary is by Jill Martin Diaz, executive director of Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, director of Legal Services for Connecting Cultures/New England Survivors of Torture and Trauma and a lecturer in the University of Vermont’s social work department.



This Thanksgiving, President Trump had us primed to panic when news broke of a Winooski second grader’s violent detention by ICE.
Vermont Asylum Assistance Project (VAAP) advocates were already being inundated with new calls for legal help when tragedy struck, following Trump’s latest half-baked and blatantly illegal policy pronouncements suspending asylum, threatening extrajudicial residency revocations, and promising retraumatizing re-processing for already highly vetted refugees.

Governor Scott could have coordinated Vermont’s first response. Instead, state silence and community chaos ensued. Unsure of who to call, neighbors inundated VAAP and partners until corrective coordination precluded meaningful legal intervention. Media requests jammed channels to a halt. Attorneys scrambled. ICE benefited.
This is a pattern. Misleading United States Citizenship and Immigration Services notices pushed two students to announce their self-deportation before consulting counsel. Scott’s silence invited manufactured chaos and, again, civil society gridlock ensued.
This year brought baseless threats to birthright citizenship; status revocations threatening work permits overnight; skyrocketing filing fees pricing working people out of status renewals; and lightspeed procedural shifts obscuring process due. 
Trump knows many policies won’t survive judicial review. That’s not careless error — it’s strategy: sow chaos that states worsen into legal access gridlock and lasting fear.
In a rare written statement, Scott called it “reasonable and prudent” for Trump to investigate immigration “security concerns or vulnerabilities” after a lone Afghan national’s gun violence. In doing so, he validated Trump’s spurious premise that one person’s actions can implicate entire classes of people. Settled law rejects collective suspicion based on race, religion or nationality. Trump’s policymaking isn’t reasonable or prudent — it’s enforcement theater and unlawful discrimination that Scott just affirmed.
Scott further described gun violence as “inexplicable.” But it is also well-settled social science, recognized by Vermont law, that what drives violence is trauma. Hurt people hurt people. A federal trauma campaign does not ameliorate security concerns. It compounds community harm.
Scott’s acquiescence — and more often, his silence — worsened legal access for the roughly 850 noncitizens held in Department of Corrections (DOC) custody on ICE detainers this year.
The DOC has a documented pattern of repeatedly disrupting pro bono legal access: protracted, ultimately fruitless operations negotiations; withheld practice policies, contradictory guidance, and rule changes mid-clinic; inconsistent meeting space for confidential client interviews; excluded interpreter and paralegal volunteers; and barred language access devices.
Most recently, DOC filed a bad-faith professional responsibility complaint against an attorney who hired a paid interpreter related to their detained client, diverting her time and attention away from client-focused deportation defense.
Vermont rejected Trump by the widest margin but went on to exacerbate lawyer scarcity and hand ICE senseless victories in the vain hope of limiting fiscal fallout. But look at Vermont’s Congressional Delegation, many of our agency leaders, our history: no amount of SNAP data divulgence, “sanctuary” wordsmithing, or civil society obstruction will hide the bluest state from Trump’s violence.
Scott’s silence and acquiescence are also violence. For 2026, it’s time for a new, proactive strategy.
In the first eight weeks of our first Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund (VILDF) grant, VAAP screened 43 detained people over six legal visits to Northwest State and Chittenden Regional facilities. Timely legal interventions secured decisive judicial orders checking ICE overreach and securing client safety. We restored access to basic health and safety for medically vulnerable detainees. We secured virtual hearing access and prevented “failure to appear” removal orders when DOC could not or would not bring detainees to court. We helped people walk free to fight their removal cases from home.
VAAP was ready to ramp up detention defense back in May, buoyed by donations, state House success and the Vermont Lawyers’ March. But Scott’s DOC obstructed efforts, delayed implementation and perpetuated ICE transfer churn, needlessly increasing self-deportation pressure for hundreds of detained people.
Vermont is not acting in “the best interest of those detained” by undermining legal access, nor by selectively condemning policies targeting “vetted” Afghan “friends and neighbors” while staying silent as Haitian and Venezuelan Vermonters lose Temporary Protected Status, Somali Vermonters face racist attacks, and a Latine second grader disappears to Texas.
Vermont must stop treating human rights and due process as anything other than constitutional guarantees. Legal access to enforce those guarantees do more than mitigate irreparable harm to individuals; they hold the line on rule of law and secure decisive checks on Executive overreach.
The Mahdawi and Öztürk cases exposed how Trump’s ICE can circumvent courts and undermine state sovereignty. Public scrutiny cultivated VAAP-supported wins for Nacho and Heidi, Mohammed, Esther, Nafiou, Vilma, Alexi, Jose, Max, and others, detained people who asserted their rights in court and preserved the rule of law for all.
We celebrate these victories and mourn what we lost. Vermont could have done more, sooner, if Scott had delivered the Vermont Constitution’s Art. 7 promise of instituting state government for the “common benefit,” rather than for the “advantage of any single person” or “sets of persons.”
In 2026, Vermont needs systemic solutions for systemic problems.
Governor Scott can lead proactive myth-busting, coordinated legal referral pathways, operational DOC legal access agreements and protocols to ensure effective—not chaotic—first response. Lawmakers can advance VAAP’s legislative recommendations. Agencies can document barriers through the Act 29 Study—rather than relying on media coverage alone.
We, the people, can demand accountability from state leaders. There are no rights without remedies, and no remedies in gridlock.
We can and will take care of ourselves and each other, Vermont. Remember: there is no justice. There is just us.

(Photo by Daniella Heminghaus/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s steep decline in medical marijuana patients continued with another 20% drop since the beginning of 2025. 
Between January and December, roughly 14,000 people let their medical marijuana registration lapse, a trend that has continued since the recreational market launched in April 2022.  
As of mid-December, 51,776 people are registered medical marijuana patients, according to the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission. In June 2022, that figure was nearly 130,000.
Medical marijuana cardholders get some benefits. Dispensaries hold patient-only hours, give patients special parking, and let them skip ahead of recreational users in line. Patients also avoid paying cannabis taxes and can purchase up to 3 ounces of cannabis per day. Before the recreational market opened, patients were the only New Jerseyans who could legally buy marijuana. 
In recent years, officials have attempted to attract people back to the medical program by dropping the price of a registration card from $200 to $10 (there’s also a free digital option). People must also obtain a card from doctors who qualify to write medical cannabis prescriptions for treatment of conditions like epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, cancer, and more. 
The drop in enrollment has reflected the trends other states have seen when launching adult-use weed. But most other states allow people to grow their own marijuana at home, particularly medical marijuana users, while New Jersey still fully bans it.

Manger scenes displayed around Christmastime usually feature an ox and an ass beside the infant Jesus. According to the Gospel of Luke, Mary placed her child in a manger – an animal feeding bin – “because there was no room for them in the inn.”
No mere babysitters, the ox and ass harken back to the Book of Isaiah 1:3, a verse early Christians interpreted as a prophecy of the birth of Christ. In some early artwork, these beasts of burden kneel to show their reverence – recognizing this swaddled babe, who entered the world in humble circumstances, as lordly.
The canonical Gospels, the accounts of Jesus’ life included in the Bible’s New Testament, make no mention of those animals welcoming the newborn. Yet the motif was already seen in art from the fourth century. It was further popularized by the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, an apocryphal text – that is, one not included in the canon of Scripture. Pseudo-Matthew was composed by an anonymous monk, probably in the seventh century, and includes many tales about Jesus growing up.
After its account of Jesus’ birth, the Bible is almost entirely silent on his childhood. Yet legends about Jesus’ early years circulated widely in the Middle Ages – the focus of my 2017 book. While the detail of the ox and ass is quite familiar to many Christians today, few are aware of the other striking tales transmitted by the apocrypha.

The Bible does include one famous scene from Jesus’ youth: the incident when 12-year-old Jesus stayed behind at the Jewish temple in Jerusalem, unbeknownst to his parents. Searching for him with great anxiety, they find him conversing with religious teachers, both asking questions and astounding them with his answers. Fourteenth-century painter Simone Martini’s “Christ Discovered in the Temple” portrays him standing before his parents with crossed arms – a stubborn youth, apparently unapologetic about making them worry for days.
The apocryphal Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew – especially versions that incorporate material from an even earlier apocryphal gospel, the Infancy Gospel of Thomas – focuses on the years of Jesus’ childhood. Like the temple story, they show the boy Jesus as sometimes difficult and having preternatural wisdom that amazes and even offends his would-be teachers. More dramatically, the apocryphal legends depict Jesus exercising divine power from a very young age.

Like the adult Jesus of the New Testament, this apocryphal Christ child often works wonders to help others in need. According to the biblical Gospel of Matthew, Mary and Joseph take the infant Jesus to Egypt after an angel warns in a dream that Herod, King of Judea, would kill the child. In Pseudo-Matthew’s elaboration of this episode, we see Jesus, not yet 2 years old, bravely stand on his feet before dragons emanating from a cave, where his family has stopped to rest.
The terrifying dragons worship him and then depart, while Jesus boldly assures those around him that he is the “perfect man” and can “tame every kind of wild beast.” He later commands a palm tree to bend down so that a weary Mary can partake of its fruits, and he miraculously shortens their journey in the desert.
At times, the Jesus of these legends is largely to blame for the troubles around him. The 14th-century Tring Tiles, now in the British Museum, depict one of Jesus’ friends imprisoned by his father in a tower. Christ pulls him out of a tiny hole, like a gallant medieval knight rescuing a maiden in distress. The father had tried to insulate his son from Jesus’ influence – understandable, considering that many legends show Jesus causing the death of his playmates or other boys who somehow irked him.
In a story summarized by one scholar as “death for a bump,” a boy runs into Jesus. He curses the child, who instantly drops down dead – though Jesus brings him back to life after a brief reprimand from Joseph.

In another tale, included in an Anglo-Norman narrative that survives in an illustrated manuscript, Jesus takes off his coat, places it upon a sunbeam and sits upon it. When the other children see this, they “thought they would do the same …. But they were too eager, and they all fell down at once. One and another jumped up quickly onto the sunbeam, but it turned out badly for them, since each one broke his neck.” Jesus heals the boys at his parents’ prompting.
Joseph admits to his neighbors that Jesus “was indeed too wild” and sends him away. The 7-year-old Jesus becomes apprenticed to a dyer, who gives him very precise directions about dyeing three pieces of cloth in three different vats. Once his master has left, Jesus ignores his instructions, throwing all the cloth into one vat – yet still achieves the desired outcome. When the master returns, he at first thinks he has been “ruined by this little rascal,” but then realizes that a wonder has occurred.

 Bond with animals

These apocryphal legends also show the boy Jesus having power over the animal world. When he enters a dreaded lion’s cave, cubs “ran about around his feet, fawning and playing with him,” while “the older lions … stood at a distance and worshipped him, and wagged their tails before him.” Jesus tells bystanders that the beasts are better than they are, because the animals “recognize and glorify their Lord.”
Indeed, these tales characterize Jesus as a rather haughty boy, conscious of his divinity and not happy with those who treat him as a mere child. At the same time, they depict him as a real child who likes to play. The boy Jesus is childlike in the way he often acts on impulse, not paying much attention to the admonitions of his elders.

His affinity for animals, too, makes him seem childlike. Strikingly, beasts in the apocrypha, beginning with the ox and ass, often seem to realize that Jesus is no ordinary child before human characters do.
The legends’ insidious insinuation that many of the Jews around Jesus were not as perceptive as the animals is part of medieval Europe’s widespread antisemitism. In one fifth-century sermon, Quodvultdeus, the bishop of Carthage, asks why the animals’ recognition of Jesus in the manger was not a sufficient sign for the Jews.

In the Bible, Jesus works his first miracle as an adult, at a wedding feast in Cana. The apocryphal tales, however, toy with the idea of the God-man revealing his power early on. The legends suggest that the childishness of Christ distracted many of those around him, preventing them from concluding that he was the Messiah. This allows the apocrypha to avoid contradicting the Bible’s reference to Jesus as simply “the carpenter’s son,” the opposite of a wonder child.
Each Christmas, modern Christians in the Western world tend to celebrate Jesus’ birthday, then quickly drop the theme of the Christ child. Medieval Christians, in contrast, were fascinated by tales about the Son of God growing up. Despite acting as a dragon tamer, physician and magician, the young Jesus of the apocrypha largely flies under the radar, cloaking his divinity with “little rascal” boyishness.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)2025 was the year that Minnesota was on the national stage for all the wrong reasons: political assassinations, a school shooting, massive fraud in public programs, the political scapegoating of Somali immigrants.
I was on the ground at several standoffs between protesters and federal immigration agents, documenting arrests and the cops’ use of force against demonstrators. (A first for me in 2025: dealing with pepper spray on the job!)
One raid, at Bro-Tex in St. Paul, wasn’t far from my home. After the agents and protesters dispersed, Nicole Neri and I decided to return to my house to file our story and photos, pepper spray still lingering on our clothes. Nicole, who has much more experience with protest coverage than I do, walked me through the process of cleaning irritants off of clothes and skin. 
Take off your outer layer of clothing before entering the home to avoid triggering your wife’s asthma. Throw everything straight into the washing machine — yes, even your coat. Wash your face, then take a shower with cold water as soon as you can — this will probably cause you to cough and gag, but it’s important. Eat once your stomach settles.
I expect to get this process down to a science in 2026, because the pushback to the Trump administration’s immigration agenda is showing no signs of slowing down.
Immigration has been front and center for me recently, but it’s just one of many impacts of the Trump administration I’ve covered this year. Here are some of the other themes from my reporting this year. 
Hunger and the government shutdown
A record-breaking federal government shutdown delayed food assistance to thousands of Minnesotans who depend on it to feed themselves and their families. 
The state pitched in $4 million to food shelves to help them meet the need, but it was a drop in the bucket. When I was visiting a food shelf in St. Paul in early November, volunteers turned away people in need for the first time.
The shutdown highlighted the importance of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is facing cuts in coming years because of the Republican mega-law passed by Congress over the summer. 
The 2026 U.S. Senate race
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith announced early this year that she will not seek re-election when her term ends, setting off a Democratic primary that will be a national signal for Democrats seeking to map out the party’s future following the disaster at the top of the ticket in 2024. 
I profiled Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig, who offer two distinct paths for the party. Flanagan is presenting herself as a candidate with a strong ideological backbone who is willing to take on Republicans and corporations head-on. Craig to replicate her success in the 2nd District by being more of a bridge-builder and win back voters who are put off by polarization in Congress. 
A consequential legislative session
Michelle Griffith is our point person at the Capitol, but I followed a handful of important issues through the session. 
Bipartisan negotiations resulted in cuts to health care programs; the repeal of MinnesotaCare eligibility for undocumented people; and a budget that took steps towards resolving a future deficit. 
Next session is unlikely to be quite as dramatic, though the speaker of the House is running for governor.

WESTON — In the New England state that grows the most Christmas trees, the Vermont Country Store offers a seeming galaxy of ornaments and add-ons, from floor-hugging skirts to ceiling-grazing stars.
“Evergreen trees are a universal symbol of the season,” the third generation of Orton family storekeepers writes on its website.
So why has the $100 million-a-year business seen a 2-foot-tall boxed alternative become a surprise bestseller?
“When things in the world seem a little chaotic, it brings back great memories and puts a smile on your face,” merchandising manager Julie Noyes said of the Charlie Brown Christmas Tree, which debuted six decades ago and has drawn new interest from people starting up or downsizing in a chilly economy.
When Charles Schulz introduced “Peanuts” 75 years ago, the late cartoonist didn’t envision the comic strip would lead to global syndication and a series of television specials, beginning with 1965’s “A Charlie Brown Christmas.”
In that show, the title character searches for the perfect Christmas tree, only to come home with a straggly sapling.
“Gee, do they still make wooden Christmas trees?” his friend Linus asks. “Maybe it just needs a little love.”
And with the addition of a blanket around its base, the conifer is soon warming hearts.
Sixty years later, $21.95 official replicas can be found at Vermont Country Stores in Weston and Rockingham, in their mail-order catalog and on their website — and in customer homes from Connecticut to California.
“It’s precious, just precious,” Jill Charbonneau said in a call from the Rockport, Maine, home she and her husband, Paul, have shared for a half-century. “It’s so simple and says everything it’s supposed to say.”
She’s not alone in her appreciation. The tree has an average customer rating of 4.9 out of 5, according to its webpage, with nearly 100 rave reviews about its simple cost, scale and upkeep from people coast to coast.
Take the Illinois couple settling into their first home. The traveling nurse on the road. The Colorado widow living alone. The Florida shopper rebuilding after a hurricane. All agree with the comment from the North Carolina woman facing mobility issues: “This little tree is my solution.” 
“It’s neat to have an old memory right in front of ya,” a Texas man adds in his review. “Takes me back to a time when life seemed so easy.”
The Vermont Country Store, with 450 year-round workers, almost doubles its staff each December to maintain its retail shops, Manchester offices and Clarendon distribution center during the busy holiday season, Noyes says. But the merchandising manager won’t specify how many Charlie Brown Christmas Trees are sold.
“Lots,” she says. “Lots and lots.”
All embodying something small and simple.
“Less is more,” one California reviewer summed up the tree. “It is a little ray of hope.”

Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway has cast news that she is being sued by the Chinese government as a badge of honor, pointing to the lawsuit as proof that her aggressive push to collect on a roughly $25 billion court judgment tied to the COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact.
But experts in international law say the lawsuit, filed in China earlier this year and announced last week by Hanaway, is more likely to do the opposite — making an already remote chance that Missouri will ever collect that money even slimmer, while potentially exposing U.S. assets abroad to retaliation.
Hanaway said last week in a news release that China is demanding a public apology from the state in a complaint filed in the Intermediate People’s Court of Wuhan, along with damages equivalent to $50.5 billion, legal fees and the right to seek additional compensation.
“This lawsuit is a stalling tactic and tells me that we have been on the right side of this issue all along,” Hanaway said.
The suit was filed after Missouri secured a default judgment earlier this year in a federal case alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the early months of the pandemic. A judge ruled for Missouri after China declined to participate in the trial, awarding the state roughly $25 billion in damages.
Hanaway has since asked the U.S. State Department to notify China that Missouri intends to pursue assets with full or partial Chinese government ownership to satisfy the judgment. Her office is also assembling a list of Chinese properties that could be targeted, focusing on assets owned outright by the Chinese government or by companies in which it has a stake.
Legal scholars say those efforts face steep, and likely insurmountable, obstacles.
Chimène Keitner, director of the U.C. Davis Center for International Law & Policy, said government-owned property is generally protected by sovereign immunity — meaning Chinese government assets in the United States are shielded from seizure, just as U.S. government property is protected abroad.
China’s countersuit, she said, also appears unlikely to result in any recovery. But it carries legal and diplomatic implications that could further complicate Missouri’s case.
International law recognizes a doctrine known as “countermeasures,” Keitner said, which allows a country to take actions it otherwise could not as a way of pressuring another country to comply with international law.
If the U.S. government were to authorize Missouri’s efforts to seize Chinese assets, she said, it could expose American property in China to reciprocal action.
“So if Missouri violates China’s sovereign immunity,” Keitner said, “China could have a good argument for doing the same thing — not just against Missouri, but against the United States as a whole.”
Missouri wants to seize Chinese assets to recover $24 billion judgment in COVID case

William Dodge, a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in international law, said neither lawsuit “has a prayer of being enforced.”
Even if Missouri were allowed to pursue assets, Dodge said, the scope would be narrow. Only property owned by the defendants named in the lawsuit — including the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China, several national agencies, provincial and local governments around Wuhan and the Wuhan Institute of Virology — could potentially be targeted.
And the state would still have to show that those specific entities were involved in hoarding personal protective equipment, he said.
Dodge agreed that China’s lawsuit further reduces the already slim likelihood that Missouri will be able to collect because it raises the risk of retaliation.
“China’s law has a reciprocity provision,” he said. “It basically says that if a foreign country gives China less immunity than Chinese law provides, China can respond by giving that foreign country less immunity. In other words: whatever the U.S. does to us, we can do to them.”
U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh initially dismissed Missouri’s lawsuit in 2022, ruling that the state could not sue China. An appeals court later allowed one claim to proceed — the allegation that China hoarded items such as respirator masks, medical gowns and gloves.
After Chinese officials failed to respond, Limbaugh accepted Missouri’s estimate of past and future damages of more than $8 billion, tripled it as federal law allows, and added 3.91% interest until the judgment is paid.
In an emailed statement last month, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said China’s pandemic response involved “acts of national sovereignty” that are not subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.
China will not pay, Liu said, and “will retaliate if necessary.”
The lawsuit filed in China accuses Missouri of “fabricating enormous disinformation” and spreading “stigmatizing and discriminating slanders” that it says have damaged China’s reputation.
Hanaway scoffed at China’s criticism.
“We stand undeterred in our mission to collect on our $24 billion judgment that was lawfully handed down in federal court,” she said.
Neither side’s claims are likely to result in any tangible recovery, Keitner said, leaving the dispute largely symbolic.
“Unfortunately, this all seems to be a lot of unhelpful political theater,” she said, “with no clear off-ramp for either side to save face.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54921771475_e3916f919a_c.jpg,,,2025-12-24 06:57:54.242719

The Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations announced that the minimum wage is set to increase by $1.25 beginning in 2026. The minimum wage rate will be in effect for all non-exempt employers.
Missouri’s HB 567, signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe into law on July 10, repealed statewide earned paid sick time while simultaneously modifying the state’s minimum wage law.
It eliminated the automatic inflation adjustments that were set to begin in 2027 and kept the $15 per hour rate for public employers. However, it is also removing voter-approved worker protections for businesses as of Aug. 28.
Lily Roberts is the managing director of economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan economic policy institute. She said conversations about adjusting the minimum wage reflect rising prices that have increased in recent years.
“Everybody can tell you about inflation, and everybody can tell you about the cost of rent or groceries or childcare being really expensive, but the flip side of that is wages,” Roberts said. “There are many folks who are worse off and less able to keep up with those raising prices because a major pillar of how we make wage policy hasn’t been changed since 2009.”
The federal minimum wage is $7.25 and it hasn’t been adjusted since 2009, which Roberts said is the longest it’s gone unchanged since the introduction of minimum wage in 1938.
“$7.25 is so unbelievably low that many people don’t even believe that it’s still that low,” Roberts said.
In Missouri, employers who are involved in retail or service businesses and have an annual gross income less than $500,000 are exempt from having to pay the state minimum wage rate. Instead, those employers can pay their workers any wage at their discretion, according to the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.
Roberts said Missouri is unique in the fact that it raised its minimum wage to reflect inflation numbers, but when the state implements a $15 an hour minimum wage, it is no longer required to factor in inflation.
Between 2015 and 2019, Missouri’s minimum wage rose just under a dollar, from $7.65 to $8.60. Since 2019, the increase has been at least $0.75 annually every year except for 2023. The $1.25 jump will be the second straight year that the minimum wage has increased by more than a dollar.
Missouri is one of 34 U.S. states, territories and districts that has a higher minimum wage than the federal requirement.
Roberts said Missouri is in line with nearby states, such as South Dakota, Nebraska and Arkansas. All of those states, plus Missouri, have consistently been working on increasing their respective minimum wages.
“Some of them are doing it gradually over time to get to ($15 an hour) and others are passing individual laws,” Roberts said. “These longer-term predictable changes are really the trend right now, where you give businesses and employees a sense of how their wages will grow over time, and it means that it’s easier to predict and easier for employers to budget for.”
She said business owners are often fighting for higher wages, contrary to popular belief, because they need to be able to compete.
“The higher your wages that you pay, in general, the lower your turnover is,” Roberts said. “So businesses that pay really small dollars tend to have a lot of turnover. It actually gets really counterproductive and expensive very quickly because the business owner has to spend all of their time hiring, training and trying to retain folks.”

A judge ruled Tuesday that 37 untabulated ballots in Hamtramck’s disputed municipal election should not be counted, affirming Adam Alharbi’s controversial and narrow victory in the race for mayor.
However, the decision is likely only the starting gun for a legal race against the clock before the city’s new mayor is sworn in at the beginning of January.
In her written decision Tuesday, Judge Patricia Perez Fresard of the Third Judicial Circuit of Michigan said that the Wayne County Board of Canvassers “exercised its discretion” when declining to count the 37 ballots after the city clerk “failed to comply with mandatory requirements imposed to protect the integrity of ballots.”
Fresard had initially ordered the parties to meet to see if they could come to a resolution. That failed, attorneys said, leading to just over 20 minutes of courtroom debate Tuesday, primarily between lawyers for Alharbi and his opponent in the mayoral race, City Council member Muhith Mahmood, who finished 11 votes behind.
Mark Brewer, representing Mahmood as well as the 37 disenfranchised voters, said that to not count the votes would be to violate a number of election-related constitutional protections. Nabih Ayad, representing Alharbi, argued that there was “absolutely no viable path” to count the ballots, and that doing so would effectively disenfranchise other voters.
“The arguments of both counsel are that the court should protect voter rights,” Fresard said Tuesday morning at the end of the hearing. “In some circumstances, it’s very difficult to protect the rights of every single individual voter.”
The dispute has brought weeks of uncertainty to Hamtramck and its nearly 28,000 residents. It all started when, due to human error, 37 absentee ballots were left in their envelopes and went uncounted on election night. Election officials discovered them a few days later and immediately delivered them to Wayne County officials.
But at some point between the end of election night and when the ballots were discovered, a number of unauthorized city officials had walked into the office where the ballots had been, breaking the chain of custody. That led county officials to question whether they should be counted, and the Wayne County Board of Canvassers ultimately deadlocked on whether to include them in the final tally. That meant that the ballots would not be counted, and Alharbi was certified as the winner by just six votes; a recount later determined his actual winning margin was 11 votes.
Mahmood then sued to have the 37 mishandled ballots counted. Brewer argued Tuesday that, otherwise, the 37 unnamed voters’ constitutional right to vote was being invalidated.
“Plaintiffs have no other remedy, other than to have their votes counted, as is their right,” he told the court. Allowing those voters to cast a new ballot would also be sufficient, he said.
But Fresard disagreed. Michigan law “does not support … that the City had a clear legal duty to tabulate the 37 votes,” she wrote. State law requires absentee votes to be tabulated according to the law, she wrote, but the board has the discretion to not count ballots it has questions about.
Brewer, in an email before the decision came down Tuesday, said he would be appealing “immediately” to the Michigan Court of Appeals “and on to the Michigan Supreme Court if necessary.”
Tuesday evening, he confirmed they had already appealed.
Hamtramck has been embroiled in election-related scandals for much of 2025. City Clerk Rana Faraj was put on leave shortly after the election, which Amer Ghalib, the city’s outgoing mayor, said was partially because her office mishandled the 37 ballots. Earlier this month, Faraj sued the city and several of its officials, alleging she was being retaliated against for reporting election fraud.
Two City Council members were charged in August with forging signatures on absentee ballots during the 2023 council race. Four others, including two other council members and an incoming council member, were named in an April document from Attorney General Dana Nessel seeking a special prosecutor for the case. No one else has been charged.

Senate Bill 235 took effect this year to offer 50% matching funds for Grow Your Own Educator initiatives, which provide tuition or loan repayment assistance for school district employees pursuing an undergraduate teaching degree.
“These matching funds are really important because they’re going to allow the schools to market this to a wider audience, increase their pipeline, and the ultimate goal is to turn existing support staff and (paraprofessionals) and teachers’ aides into certified classroom teachers once they matriculate through this process,” the bill’s author, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said. “And so, there is an urgency to this for our schools.”

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

The Oklahoma State Department of Education opened a portal in late November for districts or their affiliated nonprofits to apply for the matching funds, Pugh said.

The Education Department was slow to launch the program in the months after the bill was signed into law in May, Pugh said, but progress started to accelerate once new state Superintendent Lindel Fields took over the agency in October.
The agency has had contact with 25 districts about the program and held meetings with the Oklahoma City Public Schools Foundation, representatives of Altus schools and Tulsa Public Schools’ Tulsa Teacher Corps program, department spokesperson Bailey Woolsey said. Seven other districts have applied, but none met the required criteria.
Once an application is approved, it should take about two to three weeks for a district to receive its funds, Woolsey said.
Pugh estimated 40 districts have some version of a Grow Your Own Educator program. 
The law matches closely with the Teacher Pipeline Program at the OKCPS Foundation. President and CEO Kendra Horn said the foundation has started the process of submitting documents to apply for state Grow Your Own funds.
State funding will match half of what districts or their foundations spend for school support staff to attend state-accredited teacher preparation programs at colleges and universities.
Horn estimated the OKCPS Foundation would qualify for $80,000 to $90,000 a year in state support. That’s half the amount the foundation pays to send district paraprofessionals to the University of Central Oklahoma.
The foundation also helps program participants complete initial credits at Oklahoma City Community College and Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City before they finish their degrees at UCO.
Now in its 10th year, the OKCPS Foundation program is the “largest and most proven” of its kind in Oklahoma, Horn said.

By this spring, the program will have helped 50 classroom paraprofessionals graduate with a teaching degree, she said. Each candidate has to work as a classroom aide while completing their college credits, and they must pledge to teach in the Oklahoma City district for three years after graduation.
The foundation covers the full cost of their college tuition, fees and books. Horn said the paraprofessionals effectively double their income once they start earning a teacher’s salary.
“It’s changing their future and their kids’ future,” she said. “That’s what it’s doing. I could be really practical and talk to you about the numbers, but ultimately this is changing lives and they’re going on to change the lives of hundreds and maybe eventually thousands of kids.”
Extra funding from the state could enable the program to expand in the future, and it frees up money for the foundation to better support the current candidates, like providing them transportation to their classes, Horn said.
Along with combatting Oklahoma’s decade-long teacher shortage, the pipeline program initially was designed to bring more bilingual and racially diverse teachers into OKCPS, a district where the vast majority of students are non-white and where 46% are learning English as their non-native language. Now, it’s open to district paraprofessionals of any background, Horn said.
“I think this is the most established and successful Grow Your Own program in the state of Oklahoma right now,” she said. “I hope that more come along and that we continue to get support because education is the one thing that can determine whether or not we attract more people to this state, whether there are quality jobs and whether we all have a chance to succeed.”

From the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and rowdy town halls to legal battles over election laws and abortion restrictions, here’s a recap of the year in politics. 
The post Year in review: Wyoming’s top political stories for 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","It may not have been an election year in Wyoming, but 2025 still had plenty of standout political moments and events. 
From rowdy town halls to a new group of Republicans rising to power in the statehouse to legal battles over election laws and abortion restrictions, here’s a look back at some of those stories. 
Wyoming Freedom Caucus takes the wheel
In January, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus pitched a new legislative era of “bold policies” guided by “godly principles.”
The group of hard-line Republicans won control of the House in 2024 and this year’s general session marked their first time at the statehouse helm.

The caucus wielded that power in Cheyenne by prioritizing certain bills, pushing back on gubernatorial budget vetoes from the year prior, accusing the governor and other lawmakers of breaking the law and using the House speaker’s “drawer” to unilaterally squash 95 bills.
Meantime, other lawmakers pushed back against the caucus, perhaps most notably when the Senate announced it would not pass a supplemental budget — an unprecedented action in Wyoming. 
In the legislative off-season, known as the interim, the Freedom Caucus announced its plans to take inspiration from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal jobs and spending by “DOGE-ing” the state budget. 
From there, the caucus used the Management Audit Committee to subpoena several local officials and formed a subcommittee to scrutinize the Department of Health, which regularly has the largest budget of any state agency. 
More recently, the caucus has pledged to cut spending, citing “pre-pandemic spending levels” as a general target. 
Election laws and litigation 
Lawmakers filed a whopping 45 bills to remake Wyoming’s elections, accounting for about 8% of all legislation in both the House and the Senate this year. 
Just eight of those bills survived to Gov. Mark Gordon’s desk, including one to require residents to provide proof of citizenship and residency when registering to vote. That particular bill, which became law with Gordon’s signature, spurred a federal lawsuit that drew in high-profile attorneys, the Republican National Committee, a coalition of 25 states and Guam and the Trump administration. 
A federal court dismissed the case in July, siding with Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who was named as a defendant in his official capacity alongside the state’s 23 county clerks.

In August, Gray and the Freedom Caucus backed the Trump administration’s plans to stop states from using voting machines and mail-in ballots. The exact details of Trump’s plans remain to be seen since no executive order has been issued yet. 
In the meantime, lawmakers charged ahead — again — with election reform. Between two committees, legislators voted to sponsor 14 bills tied to elections. Some of those bills were inspired by the upheaval surrounding the Weston County clerk and an initial miscount and subsequent audit in the 2024 general election. 
Abortion
Early in the year, lawmakers passed new abortion laws, including one to require a transvaginal ultrasound before taking abortion medication, another to restrict the state’s sole facility that provides in-clinic abortions. 
Gordon vetoed the ultrasound bill before lawmakers doubled down and voted to override his veto. However, a state judge halted enforcement of the two new laws in April. Two months later, another judge blocked a third new law that dealt with off-label medications. 
At the crux of each of those legal challenges is a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution, which protects people’s rights to make their own health care decisions. 
Whether that amendment makes banning abortion unconstitutional is the central question in litigation related to the state’s two abortion bans, which the Wyoming Supreme Court considered in April. Justices grilled attorneys, but a decision in the case has yet to be published.

Chief Justice Lynne Boomgaarden told WyoFile in October that a ruling would not be expected until the year’s end. 
Property taxes
It was another big year for lawmakers seeking to cut residential property taxes. But the House and the Senate didn’t always see eye to eye. 
While firefighters, sheriffs, community colleges and special districts appeared at the Capitol in protest of blanket property tax cuts during the legislative session, the two chambers squared off. 
First, the Senate rejected House amendments to a proposal to create a two-year tax break for homeowners, partly on account of confusion over what exactly the lower chamber’s changes did to the bill. And after a deal was allegedly struck, it fell apart with Senate leadership accusing their House counterparts of backing out of an agreement. 
Lawmakers ultimately settled on a deal to cut residential property taxes by 25%, resulting in reduced local services in certain parts of the state. Separately, it will be up to voters in next year’s election to decide whether to approve an additional 50% cut. 
In June, Sen. Bob Ide, R-Casper, asked legislators to consider an even more sweeping proposal — to amend the Wyoming Constitution to abolish property taxes altogether. 
That prompted about two dozen Casper homeowners to attend a legislative committee meeting in August urging lawmakers against further cuts.

In November, the Joint Revenue Committee voted to sponsor one bill to eliminate residential property taxes, another to raise sales taxes to replace the resulting revenue loss. 
The measures will be up for consideration by the entire Legislature next year. 
In memoriam
In September, the assassination of Charlie Kirk shocked the state, including those in Wyoming who helped the commentator get his start and those who credit him with inspiring their political lives. Kirk’s death also sparked disputes about free speech. 
Wyoming also mourned the passing of many who served in elected office, including former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson, former Secretary of State Kathy Karpan, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, state Rep. John Eklund and former Superintendent of Public Instruction Judy Catchpole.

The heavily redacted tranche of documents violates the public's right to know, writes columnist Rod Miller. 
The post Opaque transparency, the Epstein files and you appeared first on WyoFile .","Bad stuff always happens when our government cloaks itself in secrecy and doesn’t tell us what it is doing in our name. We get into wars and people die. Our money is stolen from us and assholes get rich. Our elected leaders break our laws with impunity, violate our trust and we are left with an impotent system. Bad stuff.

Opinion

A democratic society such as ours can only thrive in the bright sunlight of transparency. It only works as intended when the citizens know what their government is doing on their behalf.
When government keeps secrets from the people, that system cannot be called free. It is by definition something else entirely.
Take the Epstein files, for instance. The seedy nexus between a convicted sex offender and powerful politicians and celebrities has been fertile ground for conjecture for years. Our Department of Justice has investigated that nexus thoroughly and compiled hundreds of thousands of documents and photographs as evidence. But the DOJ has long kept those files embargoed from the public, leaving us to assume that powerful politicians are being protected by government secrecy.
Conspiracy theories have sprouted like mushrooms in all that darkness.
The burning question is not which rich, powerful men were canoodling with teenage girls on Epstein’s private seraglio island, but rather why our government, particularly the DOJ, refuses to release the information. This issue is best viewed not through a lens of titillating scandal among elites or partisan one-upsmanship, but rather through the clear lens of the public’s right to know.
To quell the supposition over the files and quench the conspiracy theories, Congress passed a bespoke law to force the DOJ to release the information by a certain date. House Resolution 4405, “The Epstein Files Transparency Act,” was passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on Nov. 19. It mandated that ALL Epstein files be released within 30 days.
The law also strictly limited what information could be redacted from the files. It specified that no information contained in the files could be withheld or redacted to protect politicians or other powerful people from embarrassment. Here is the pertinent section of the law: “No record shall be withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.”
The only redactions allowed by law are to protect the privacy of victims or for purposes of national security. I think we can all agree that Epstein and his cronies were not on the island to discuss our military order of battle in the Mideast, the names of our spies on foreign soil or our plans to annex Greenland. National security was not the reason they were cavorting with middle school cheerleaders.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

Yet, despite the specificity of the law, the DOJ barely beat the deadline and released only a fraction of the Epstein files to the public. And the tranche that was released was heavily redacted.
That means the U.S. Department of Justice, the nation’s highest law enforcement organization, defied both the president and Congress and broke the law. And they did so to keep hidden from the American people information that the executive and legislative branches of government ordered to be revealed.
Think, for a moment, about the lawlessness of that behavior by the DOJ. About the cynicism and hubris. If the top law enforcement agency in our government breaks the law to protect powerful elites, how can we call ourselves a nation under law?
It doesn’t matter one rat’s ass whose names are in the Epstein files, or to what party they belong. The law states that those names must be revealed to the public as a matter of transparency.
For DOJ bureaucrats to defy the law and keep secrets from us should piss us all off!
Trump can provide that transparency, if he wants to, with a phone call or the stroke of his pen. He can order Attorney General Pam Bondi to comply with the law. If she refuses, he can fire her and replace her with someone who will follow orders. Nixon proved, with his Saturday Night Massacre, that a president has that power.
The ball is in Trump’s court.
Among all the gripes we have about government — taxes, immigration, woke policies, ICE, National Guardsmen in our streets, blowing up Venezuelan “drug” boats, DEI and so many other legitimate complaints — government not trusting citizens enough to tell us the truth should outweigh them all.
Telling citizens the truth is, in my estimation, the most important job of government. Without that, we cannot be a free people. As Jesus said, in John 8:32, “Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”

Contractors recently completed a 29-acre fuels reduction project in Virgil Phillips Farm Park, near Moscow, that should make the park more resilient to wildfires.
The project is a partnership between the Latah Soil and Water Conservation District and Latah County. The farm and park, donated to the City of Moscow many years ago, is managed by Latah County. It’s located about five miles north of town on the northwest shoulder of Moscow Mountain, west of U.S. Highway 95.


For more information, go to https://www.latahswcd.org/.


“The conservation district got us moving on the project,” said Tom Lamar, a Latah County commissioner. “It seems like it turned out really well.”
The 160-acre park is popular with locals. It features a number of hiking trails that lead through a variety habitats including forested lands, open fields and wetlands. The park includes several intermittent streams and two ponds. It is home to a variety of wildlife species such as moose, elk, deer, black bear, birds and amphibians. Visitors can enjoy historic and newly planted orchards in the park as well.
Latah County recently completed an updated Community Wildfire Protection Plan in 2023, which identified high fire risk areas in the county and strategies to improve resilience. Forested areas in the Urban-Rural Interface were identified as being especially vulnerable to wildfires. With recent population growth, more people are interested in finding rural homes in the Moscow Mountain area. 
“Recent relatively large fire events clearly illustrate the mounting urban-interface issue facing Latah County,” the Community Wildfire Protection Plan said. “Population growth rates have been greatest in the western part of the County around Moscow, Viola, and Potlatch. Agricultural land is being subdivided and people are moving to the more rural parts of the County.
“The growing appreciation for seclusion has led to significant development in many of the lower elevation forests. Frequently, this development is in the dry ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir, forest types where grass, needles, and brush surface litter create forest fuel conditions that are at a high propensity for fire occurrence,” the Community Wildfire Protection Plan report said.

That type of forest eco-type is exactly the kind of environment found at the Virgil Phillips Farm Park.
“Wildfires are always a concern,” said Ryan Lawrence, district manager of the Latah Soil and Water Conservation District. “The Clearwater Complex fires were really a wake-up call. Our summers are getting hotter and drier. You always wonder, where will the next fire be?” 
The Clearwater complex fires in 2015 were lightning-caused events that destroyed 48 homes and 70 outbuildings and consumed 68,127 acres of private, state and federal land. A number of other fires have occurred between 2015 and 2021 in the county, according to the Community Wildfire Protection Plan report.
There were two fires that occurred in Latah County in 2025 – the 80-acre Lamb Fire near Troy and the White Pine Fire near the Giant White Pine campground in September. 
Out of the recent fires that have occurred, most were caused by either humans or lightning, the report said. The historical frequency of fires in the local area ranges from once every 35 years to 200 years, depending on elevation. 
By completing the Community Wildfire Protection Plan report, Latah County became eligible for grant funding for fuel-reduction projects, said Mauri Knott, senior planner for the county. “It’s been years since we got funding for fire prevention projects,” she said. “The Phillips Farm project created an opportunity to do some fuel-reduction work, education outreach and create some momentum for future projects.”
The Latah SWCD applied for $70,000 in funding from Avista Corporation and Title 3 federal funds to cover the project costs. With the money in hand, Latah County hired Northwest Management to create a detailed forest management plan for the park. The fuels-reduction work was completed in Fall 2025. 
In a fact sheet about the project, the Latah District said, “The Virgil Phillips Farm has been designated as a priority area for fuels-reduction treatment due to the timbered borders along the wildlife-urban interface, where small acreage developments and public access significantly elevate the threat of wildfires. 
“Phillips Farm and adjacent private lands will be treated through vegetation removal to slow the spread of a fire, create fire breaks to improve access for firefighters to respond, improve forest health and protect homes.”
The following practices were implemented: 

Forest thinning by removing trees of poor quality, those infested with insects or disease, and small-diameter conifer trees to maintain an open forest structure and avoid crown fires. 
Removing ladder fuels through limbing lower branches to reduce the spread of ground fire into the canopy.
Masticate understory growth and slash resulting from tree and limb removal. 

Officials with Northwest Management said they thought the project went well. 
“I think we hit the objectives,” said Tucker Flaten, a forester for Northwest Management, based in Moscow. “Our main concern was the fuel conditions. We wanted to create opportunities for fire crews to break up fuel continuity.”
They also looked at the spacing between trees to ensure that if there were a fire in the area and a tanker plane was flying overhead to drop retardant on the blaze, the retardant could reach the ground,” he said. 
The treatments mainly took out trees less than 10” in diameter and a lot of brush, he said.

Latah Commissioner Lamar was worried that too much brush and ground vegetation would be removed, potentially harming smaller critters that depend on that habitat for survival. But after touring the property, he thought things looked A-OK. 
“My biggest question was about the impact to the ecosystem that relies on the understory for survival – the habitat on the forest floor,” he said. “But in touring the property, I realized that they weren’t doing 100 percent of the brushing treatment and mastication across the landscape. They were leaving some of that low-lying habitat for edge effect for wildlife.
“They did a good job. Tucker was great – he understood how to do the fuels-reduction treatments so they would reduce the fire hazard keep doing more projects,” Lawrence said. 
He sees the Virgil Phillips Farm Park project as a “demonstration” project that will help educate the local community about the need for fuels-reduction projects. Two public tours of the farm project have given local residents a chance to see the results. Information signage will be placed in the park to inform visitors about the benefits of fuels reduction work and forest health.

Ahmed Jallow: “I’m selecting the piece on mental health support in Black churches and barbershops as my story of the year. It’s a favorite of mine because it’s truly solutions-oriented, showcasing how these community-run spaces are creating their own networks of support where they’re needed most.”
On a Tuesday afternoon in July, inside The Bar Ber Shop in Raleigh, Reggie Winston, 41, talks about a subject many of his young clients rarely discuss anywhere else: mental health. 
Winston, who is trained in mental health first aid and suicide prevention, remembers battling depression in high school without realizing it. “I had no clue what I was experiencing was depression,” he said. It wasn’t until he heard someone else’s story that he recognized his own, a realization that led him to therapy and, eventually, a mission.  
After the COVID-19 pandemic, Winston expanded the community work he’d started years earlier with free blood pressure screenings in his shop. This time, he turned to mental health, founding Grooming Resources and Opportunities, a nonprofit that trains barbers to spot signs of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. 
His method begins with seemingly casual questions when someone climbs into his barber chair. Instead “How are you?” he’ll ask, “What time did you wake up? What are your plans today?” As he snips and shapes, his clients reveal pieces of their lives they rarely share anywhere else.
Slowly, in the safety of his barber chair, these simple inquiries allow clients to reveal what’s really happening in their lives, Winston said.  
“Once they get comfortable and start trusting you with their haircut,” Winston said, “they start trusting you with their mind and their heart.” 
From 2013 to 2022, 377 Black North Carolinians ages 10 to 24 died by suicide, according to data. Nearly 17% of Black high school students said they had seriously considered suicide. Among middle schoolers, more than a third reported the same. The numbers peak at age 24 — and are especially stark for Black girls questioning their sexual orientation, who now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide. 
“The myth that Black people don’t die by suicide has been dangerous,” said Bettie Murchison, a longtime advocate who runs the Village of C.A.R.E. in Wake County. “We’ve had to fight against that in our families, in our churches, and in our schools.”

Winston’s effort is a key part of North Carolina’s response to rising suicide rates among Black youth. This year, the state health department launched the Black Youth Suicide Prevention Action Plan, a five-year initiative that leans on trusted community spaces, including barbershops and churches, to expand support and prevent suicide among Black youth and young adults. Unlike the state’s broader suicide-prevention strategy, this plan focuses on the unique needs of Black youth.  
Dr. Sonyia Richardson, a UNC Chapel Hill researcher and one of the plan’s architects, said it was built on listening sessions with young people and their communities. “This is not a top-down plan,” she said. “It’s community-led, community-driven, community-implemented.” 
One of its guiding principles: young people in crisis often turn not to doctors, but to trusted adults in familiar places — coaches, pastors, aunties, barbers. 
“We’re meeting the needs of communities where youth are more likely to seek support. From local YMCAs, churches, and community centers rather than traditional mental health providers,” Richardson said. 
Barbershops and churches 
That’s where Winston and his longtime friend, counselor Rodney Harris, come in. This year alone, he and Harris have trained more than a dozen barbers in mental health first aid training. These programs teach them to spot warning signs of mental distress and suicide, as well as how to safely talk with clients about limiting access to firearms and other deadly means. They’ve trained barbers across Raleigh, Wake Forest and Durham. Soon they’ll be in Rocky Mount. 
“Barbers often know more about their clients’ lives than anyone else,” Harris said. “When a clinician approaches, youth might be skeptical. But when a barber speaks, they listen.” 
Barbershops have become hubs for this work well beyond North Carolina. The Confess Project, for example, has trained barbers across the country in mental health advocacy. 
What’s different with GRO is that they train barbers to become community leaders themselves, Harris said. “What we saw as a gap in the research is to make the barbers trainers and then have them go into the community, offer additional trainings, and then they can also offer recruitment,” Harris said. That work, he added, includes expanding mental health first aid and counseling on access to lethal means, known as CALM.
The same approach is playing out in churches. Through Murchison’s Village of C.A.R.E. program, she trains pastors and faith leaders to act as first responders. “If we can get them to understand this is as much a part of their ministry as teaching the Bible,” she said, “we can reach a generation of youth who don’t see a therapist as their first line of defense.”

 Building trust beyond the shop

State officials have identified 17 counties in North Carolina that are in urgent need of suicide prevention efforts. These counties, which range from major metropolitan areas like Durham, Wake, and Mecklenburg to smaller, rural communities such as Edgecombe, Halifax and Hoke, have the highest rates of Black youth suicides and the highest volume of 988 crisis calls. In each of these communities, Black residents make up at least 25% of the population. 
Still, many young people don’t trust the 988 Lifeline. Black youth are underrepresented among callers, even though they show up disproportionately in emergency room visits for self-injury. Officials say building confidence in the hotline is essential to reaching young people before a crisis escalates.  
Kelly Crosbie, director of the state’s Division of Mental Health, said fear and mistrust keep many from using the hotline. “There’s just personal shame, not knowing who’s on the other end, and what’s going to happen,” she said. Some families worry that calling could trigger involuntary hospitalization or even police involvement. “Some of these young folks, their families have already experienced trauma when they’ve tried to engage with treatment systems or government systems,” she added. 










Once they get comfortable and start trusting you with their haircut,” Winston said, “they start trusting you with their mind and their heart.


– Reggie Winston


Mistrust can run even deeper for LGBTQ youth. In North Carolina, Black girls who are questioning their sexual orientation now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide. At the same time, the federal government eliminated funding for the 988 “Press 3” option, which connected LGBTQ and transgender callers to specialized counselors. Advocates warn the loss strips away a culturally competent lifeline that has reached more than a million young people nationwide. 
State officials say they have begun training local crisis counselors to handle calls from that population and are working with communities to ensure that 988 operators are equipped with inclusive, culturally aware training. “We’re losing that specialized national line,” Crosbie told NC Health News last month, “but we are making sure our 988 here is well-trained and ready.” 
The state has also launched a youth-led awareness campaign, called “Stronger Together” initiative. Messaging, visuals, and formats are being created by Black youth themselves to make the hotline feel credible and relatable. “We need to get the messaging straight from young people,” Crosbie said. The effort includes training peers and trusted community figures—like pastors, coaches, and barbers—to recognize warning signs and encourage youth to seek help. 
Current data shows texting and chat are the most utilized 988 services among North Carolina youth. Crosbie said that makes it even more important to meet young people where they are—whether that’s on their phones, in churches, or in barbershops. “We need to make sure the help is in places and spaces that people trust,” she said. 
In addition to breaking cultural stigmas surrounding mental health discussions, other strategies include reducing access to lethal means and providing gun locks, and hosting community trainings. 
The first Black youth suicide prevention conference is scheduled for September in Rocky Mount, which is one of the high need areas. Richardson hopes the plan will serve as a national model for suicide prevention among diverse populations. “We are focusing on those populations most impacted in our state… and I think this also provides a blueprint for how to create [prevention strategies] across the state.”
Back at The Bar Ber Shop, Winston says he sees that trust forming every day. Kids sit in his chair for a haircut and end up sharing the things they don’t tell teachers or parents. 
“Barbers are the bridge for people to get the help they need,” Winston said. “We are the trusted few.”

After Karlene Ferrante broke her femur, she underwent major surgery and was transferred to a skilled nursing facility to recover. She spent a little over two months at the county-owned Portage County Health Care Center in Stevens Point, Wisconsin.
“​​I lucked out and got sent to the Portage County Healthcare Center. They took wonderful care of me for that whole summer and until I was able to go home,” Ferrante said. “Because of that great care that I got, I am able to walk. I have my leg. I didn’t get an infection and I didn’t fall. They were adequately staffed and they provided really good care.”
There are only two skilled nursing facilities in Stevens Point. The publicly-owned Portage County Health Care Center, which has served the community for nearly a century and has a five-star rating from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the privately-owned Stevens Points Health Services, which has a one-star rating from CMS. Ferrante was relieved to get into the county-owned facility, but the relief faded when she returned home and learned that the county was considering selling Portage County Health Care Center to a private company.
“When I found out that they were trying to privatize it, I decided then that I’m going to work on this,” Ferrante said. “I’m not going to let that happen, because other people should be able to get the same kind of care that I got.”
Across Wisconsin, County Boards have been voting to sell their skilled nursing facilities as local communities fight the sales, especially in rural counties. In Portage County, retired professor Ferrante, a two-time patient at the Portage County Health Care Center, has joined the Save the Portage County Health Care Center group, which opposes the privatization of the county facility.
“We are the only five-star skilled nursing facility in Portage County,” said Nancy Roppe, a lifelong resident of Portage County and one of the group’s organizers. “The quality of care is stellar… people clamor to get their care here, because they know when they press the call button, somebody will respond.”
In 2018, Portage County residents approved a four-year, $5.6 million referendum to support the facility’s operations. Then, in 2022, they passed another measure authorizing tax increases to fund the construction of a new facility.
Roppe said the referendums signaled public strong support for Portage County Health Care Center, but Portage County is trying to sell the health care center to The Ensign Group, a private company which has purchased other nursing facilities in the state.

In Lincoln County, Wisconsin, the County Board voted over the summer to sell the county-owned Pine Crest Nursing Home, which had been serving the county for over 70 years, to Ensign. Just a few months after the transition from county to corporate ownership, members of the Lincoln County community have seen noticeable changes in the quality of care.
“We are already seeing the changes,” said Pastor Mike Southcombe, the senior pastor at St. Stephen’s United Church of Christ in Merrill, the county seat of Lincoln County. “The staffing is less than it was when the county ran it.”
Research consistently shows that publicly-owned facilities not only maintain higher staffing and care standards but also serve as essential safety nets for vulnerable populations, ensuring access to long-term care for residents who might otherwise be turned away by for-profit operators.
A 2022 report by the Center for Medicare Advocacy warned that privatizing county-owned nursing homes often led to lower staffing levels and diminished quality of care, as for-profit operators prioritized revenue over residents’ needs. The report found that promised cost savings rarely materialized, while accountability and public oversight were significantly reduced.
An academic study also found that privatizing county-owned nursing homes increased regulatory violations and reduced residents’ quality of care and quality of life, while failing to improve access for Medicaid recipients.
Working Class Storytelling reported that during a February town hall in Lincoln County, data presented by LeadingAge Wisconsin indicated that publicly-owned nursing homes in the state provide higher-quality care than private or nonprofit facilities.
While some Lincoln County officials said that the county did not have adequate funding to continue the operation of Pine Crest, Eileen Guthrie, a retired accountant who lives in Lincoln County and regularly volunteered at Pine Crest, crunched the numbers and found that Pine Crest was bringing in a profit.
“I started looking at all of the public records, whether they were from the finance committee or the county board, or online… I kept digging and digging,” said Guthrie, who was an active member with People for Pine Crest. When she looked through all the 2023 and 2024 financial statements, she found that Pine Crest had a positive balance upwards of $400,000 in 2023 and a positive balance above $550,000 in 2024. Guthrie said part of this positive balance was due to the state’s Medicaid reimbursement policies.

Lincoln County officials said the sale of Pine Crest would help relieve the county’s deficit, though they did not clarify what expenses were driving that deficit.
“I know not everybody’s happy about it. I understand that all of us, most of us, have people in Pine Crest, and I understand that, but I’m comfortable with Ensign, that they’ll be here and they’re going to serve the community properly,” said County Supervisor Greg Hartwig at a July County Board meeting, according to WXPR.
As the county pushed forward with the sale, many residents felt their voices were ignored. Among them was Scott Doerr, a Lincoln County resident who had worked in local factories for more than 30 years before retiring. Frustrated by the way local officials handled the Pine Crest sale, he filed paperwork to run for County Board Supervisor.
“I just felt that the county board wasn’t listening to the citizens,” Doerr said. “I’m probably going to be campaigning on giving the voice back to the people.”
The sale has raised deeper concerns about the future of the facility.
“Being county-owned was a comfort and now we have to wonder, year to year, if they’re going to sell it for profit and make things worse instead of better.” Doerr said.
That concern about the future of nursing care is shared by others who see the facility as more than just a business, but as a vital community resource.
“People have been paying taxes on [Pine Crest], volunteering at it, supporting it, all those years, with the expectation that it would be around for them when they needed it, or be around for family members when they needed it,” Southcombe said. “The population up here, as it is everywhere, is aging. The elementary schools are shrinking. The need for nursing homes in home care and just general health services is just going to increase. And we’re also going to need people to work at those places.”

For Guthrie, the sale of Pine Crest is not necessarily the end of the fight for better community services.
“The loss was significant, but there is a win in there,” Guthrie said. “All of these people worked together for the good of the community, for the good of the employees and the residents. And maybe that’ll be enough to say, okay, yeah, we lost, but there are other things that we can do, so I’m hoping that there will be more to come.”
As the Save the Portage County Health Care Center group has watched other sales, like those in Lincoln County, happen, they are working to get creative about spreading the word across the county ahead of deciding votes. They have started sharing information in newspaper ads, billboards, and online videos.
“We’ve had to go and reinvent the wheel. We’ve come up with new ways to reach the public. And how does the public react when they know? They are angry,” Ferrante said. “They’re surprised. After voting twice to support the referendums and paying the taxes to have the nursing home continue and be rebuilt, people have been shocked to learn that the current administration in the county is just selling it.”
With the county’s vote looming this week, local community advocates said the stakes feel like a matter of life and death, and they aren’t slowing down.
“Where do we find the energy to fight [for Portage County Health Care Center]? For me, I feel like I owe them,” Ferrante said. “They kind of saved my life.”

(Getty Images)People without health insurance are human, and they still get sick. When they get very sick, they go to emergency rooms, like everyone else. Without Medicaid expansion, the cost of their care falls on the hospitals. 
Doctors make lots of money, so that’s fine, right? Wrong. Most hospitals are nonprofits, and rural hospitals are running on a shoestring budget. It’s no secret that Idaho is experiencing significant health care worker shortages. When funding for health care gets cut, Idaho loses medical professionals. 
 The Medicaid expansion issue

The Idaho Legislature may consider ending Medicaid expansion in 2026, which covers roughly 90,000 people in Idaho. This is despite legislation that was passed as a compromise to ending the program — legislation that hasn’t even taken effect yet. 
When Medicaid expansion started, the Legislature did away with the old way of funding indigent medical care through the county and state programs. If cut, there are no options for Idahoans who lose their coverage. 
If Medicaid expansion ends, it would recreate a coverage gap. Meaning Idahoans that make up to 100% of the federal poverty line ($15,650 for an individual) would not qualify for Medicaid or a tax credit on the state-based exchange that makes health insurance affordable for low-income families. 
Who pays their medical bills when they get sick? The rural hospitals that cannot legally nor morally deny an ill person care. Until that rural hospital is so overwhelmed that it’s forced to close its doors. Ultimately resulting in longer drives to get an emergency room in Idaho’s massive state, that covers 44 counties and stretches across more than 83,000 square miles. 
How far do you want to drive to get to an ER doctor?
 The return on investment

Why else should we keep Medicaid expansion? The return on investment is indisputable. For every $1 of state investment, Idaho receives $9 in federal investment. By keeping Medicaid expansion in place, Idaho sees approximately $1 billion invested into the health care economy. 
In state fiscal year 2025, Medicaid expansion only accounted for 1.6% of general fund expenditures.
Medicaid is also the largest payer for behavioral health services in Idaho with one in three on Medicaid expansion having a mental illness. 
Because of Medicaid expansion, we can receive a 90/10 match from the federal government to cover new moms who qualify for Medicaid during the 12 months postpartum, saving state dollars. Idaho currently covers approximately 30% of births through Medicaid.
 Economic benefits

Let’s talk money. Medicaid expansion has created a massive benefit to our economy.

For every federal dollar invested in Medicaid, Idaho sees an increase in $1.82 in gross economic activity. For fiscal year 2025, that equates to approximately $1.587 billion dollars invested in our economy.
Medicaid expansion produces an additional 9,362 jobs throughout the state.
Over $35 million in general fund revenue and $12 million in property taxes generated annually as a result of expansion.

It’s time we acknowledged the role that Medicaid plays in our health care infrastructure and economy. In no other industry would we consider taking away $1 billion out of our infrastructure that provides this level of economic benefit. 
Report: Federal funds for Idaho Medicaid expansion spurs $1.5 billion in economic output

Repealing Medicaid expansion is a step backward that leaves Idahoans in a worse place than they were in 2018, when Idaho voters initially passed the initiative by a ballot measure with 61% of the vote. 
At least then there were indigent funds available, that while imperfect, helped prevent shifting the cost burden to hospitals and taxpayers’ private insurance company premiums. 
Medicaid expansion is simply something Idaho cannot afford to lose.

BRUCETON MILLS, W.Va. — A fierce gust of wind whips through the trees in Bruceton Mills on a chilly fall morning. Three energetic dogs run through the gravel and fading blades of grass despite the cold weather. The front door to a miniature cabin swings open and out steps James Prutilapac, the owner of more than 40 acres of relatively untouched Preston County natural beauty.
The West Virginian observes his property on the frosty mountain morning of Nov. 5, 2025, and there are no power lines to be seen in the skies. Instead, the occasional bird or falling leaf. That view will change if the proposed route of NextEra’s MARL transmission lines comes to fruition, which may impact Prutilapac’s view, as well as land in four other counties.

“No one I have talked to has been in favor of the project,” Prutilapac said. “There are different levels of antagonism toward [MARL], but I haven’t spoken to any locals who are in support of it.”
NextEra Energy Transmission proposed the MidAtlantic Resiliency Link (MARL) transmission line, a 500-kilovolt entity that would run more than 107 miles from Pennsylvania to Virginia. The primary purpose of the line, according to NextEra’s website, is to “strengthen the power grid, and help power what matters most — our homes, our businesses and our way of life.”
NextEra’s MARL transmission line project has not yet been approved by the state’s public service commission, as of Nov. 17, 2025. A decision on the final route is expected by spring 2027, according to NextEra.


Prutilapac is one of more than a thousand members of the Facebook group “WATI — West Virginians Against Transmission Line Injustice,” a grassroots organization fighting against the addition of transmission lines such as MARL. The organization is based in Fort Ashby, a town roughly an hour east of Bruceton Mills.
The sentiment remains relatively the same among the group despite the miles and mountains between its members: The proposed lines would benefit surrounding states, but not the state most impacted by their presence.
“It’s a project going from a power station in Pennsylvania to feed data centers in Northern Virginia,” Prutilapac said of the proposed MARL project. “It’s not as though it’s a project that they’re adding the lines because there are underserved communities 10 minutes down the road.”
WATI Secretary Sara Evans shared a similar sentiment.
“Electricity is nice, but I don’t want [transmission lines] destroying the view and the memories just to give electricity through to someplace else,” Evans said.
The addition of transmission lines is partly due to the rapidly growing need for more power in the age of artificial intelligence and increased data use.
“We have a lot of demand growth in the region and across the country,” said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies. “Power demand was flat for 25 years, and now, suddenly, it’s like 3% per year, which is a lot in terms of the gigawatts of power that we need to add.”
Internet use among adults steadily increased between 2000 and 2024, rising from 52% to 96% during that period, according to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center. That statistic combined with the rise of AI shows how much power is needed to fuel the country’s demand.
Prutilapac is more focused on conserving the wildlife and nature on his land as well as the quiet life it provides him and less on the frenetic pace of power growth.
“Environmentally, the [proposed transmission line] is going to be taking out a lot of trees, which I don’t want to see that happen,” Prutilapac said. “There’s a lot of wildlife up here. We regularly have black bear, red and grey fox, fisher, coyote, and then obviously deer, raccoon, opossum, things that are everywhere in West Virginia.”
The transmission company has land agents in contact with potentially impacted residents to sign easements as the process moves forward. These transmission routes are not set in stone and according to Rob Gramlich, they often deal with rerouted plans.
“Reroutes are a normal part of a transmission line’s life and there are a lot of factors,” said Gramlich, the president of Grid Strategies. “Looking at land issues and river and creek crossings, and how many people are going to actually see [lines] and what the communities actually think, so it is a normal part of the [routing] process.”
WVU engineering professor and energy expert Professor Anurag Srivastava said routes that directly impact people are only approved when there is a great need.
“If [the transmission route] is going through a part of the town, or especially if it will impact the people that are living there, well I guess in most cases, then it does not happen,” Srivastava said. “Unless the benefit is a lot, then they have to compensate people to move from that land to other land, and so it will cost the transmission line builder more money.”
The proposed MARL plan, if successful, would require compensation to residents like Prutilapac due to the invasive nature of the route. Agents have already made offers, according to the Bruceton Mills landowner.

“We’ve had a guy from NextEra that has contacted us, and he’s kind of been in regular contact; he’s obviously trying to get us to sign contracts and whatnot, but no one has contacted us from any state agency or anything,” Prutilapac said.
Those opposed to the transmission line say the fight will continue despite potential monetary compensation.

(Photo: Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent.) A new state audit has identified flaws in the way the Department of Human Services investigates complaints against child care centers in Tennessee, potentially placing children at risk.
The department investigates approximately 6,000 allegations of child abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation made each year against legally and illegally operating childcare providers across the state.
The Tennessee Comptroller found some of these investigations lacked required documentation, including proof inspectors had visited the childcare center, incomplete “action plans” holding child care operators responsible for improvements and misclassified forms.
Some investigations into allegations of misconduct inside childcare centers weren’t initiated or concluded in the legally required timeframe, the audit found. 
One complaint against an illegal child care operator lacked a temporary restraining order to shut it down that was “essential when conditions present an immediate threat to children’s health or safety,” the audit found.

“Without stronger oversight and accountability measures, the department cannot fully assure the public that it consistently protects children in Tennessee’s childcare system,” the audit said.
Commissioner Clarence Carter acknowledged the ongoing problems with child care center investigations to lawmakers last week. 
Carter pledged to “strengthen our processes to ensure our investigation process is timely and properly documented at DHS.” 
“We are committed to promoting early childhood environments that are safe, healthy and developmentally rich and appropriate,” he told lawmakers sitting on a legislative subcommittee reviewing the audit on Dec. 16. 
The department has also provided more training to staff and updated its child care licensing technology systems, he said. 
The audit did not note any child had been directly harmed as a result of the investigation lapses it identified.
The Department of Human Services oversees approximately 2,000 licensed agencies that serve 200,000 children statewide. It also oversees 354 childcare centers that aren’t required to get a license because they serve fewer than five unrelated children. 
The audit reviewed the department’s operations between  2021 and 2025. Failures to properly investigate child care center complaints were also identified in a prior audit.

(Photo provided, Santos Port Authority)From the docks of the Port of Santos, a 58-terminal complex covering an area the size of 1,500 American football fields, ships loaded with soybeans prepare to set sail for China. 
Less than 45 miles from São Paulo, the port services nearly a quarter of Brazil’s soybean exports. For decades, U.S. agribusiness giants like Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill have operated facilities at the port. 
Today, they share space with COFCO International, China’s state-owned food conglomerate, which has invested around $285 million in recent years. The expansion will make it the port’s largest dry bulk terminal.

And Santos isn’t alone. In the west, the Port of Chancay is rising on Peru’s central coast.
COSCO Shipping, a state-owned Chinese company, is investing at least $3.5 billion to construct 15 berths, logistics facilities, and a 1.1-mile tunnel, enabling cargo to be channelled directly from the port to nearby highways.
Once fully operational, Chancay will function as a regional redistribution hub for exports from Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and Colombia: from copper and lithium to soybeans and other agricultural products. Upon completion around 2035, it is expected to become the region’s third-largest port.
These and other recent investments across the region have positioned China to source more agricultural products from Latin America as it pivots away from U.S. farmers in response to President Trump’s higher tariffs. 
China first began that pivot in 2018, when Trump’s first-term tariff hikes ignited a global trade war. But since returning to office, the president has renewed that strategy, and China’s investments signal a generational shift that may not reverse if and when the trade war subsides. 
“What are the signs that China’s here to stay [in Latin America]? Really, the infrastructure,” said Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a U.S. nonprofit policy research organization that reports 23 ports across Latin America have some degree of Chinese investment.  
“Ports, railways, roads, bridges, metro lines, energy, power plants are probably the best signs that China has a long-term commitment … These are long-term projects.”
Daniel Munch, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation, said that when a country gains control over ports that make trade faster, cheaper and more reliable, such as the Port of Chancay, trade flows tend to “lock in.” Reversing that trend, he warned, would require the United States to narrow its efficiency gap, noting that none of its container ports rank among the world’s top 50.
“It could entrench patterns,” Munch said.
This is bad news for American farmers, particularly soybean growers. 
Soybeans are a cornerstone of American agriculture, particularly in the Midwest. Nationwide, more than 270,000 farms grow the crop, according to the latest Census of Agriculture. In Illinois, nearly half of all farms depend on soybean production, and in Iowa and Minnesota, about four in 10 do.

In 2024, more than 40% of U.S. soybean production was exported, with about half going to China.
But tensions between the United States and China have risen this year – Trump has increased tariffs and recently threatened a 157% tax on all Chinese imports, while China responded by reducing U.S. soybean imports to near zero for six months. 
A trade deal announced in November ends the suspension and includes commitments for China to buy 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the final two months of 2025 and at least 25 million metric tons annually through 2028, according to Purdue University and farmdoc Daily. 
Brazil has stepped in as China’s biggest supplier of soybeans, which are used to feed livestock to support protein demand. 
China has become one of the two main export markets for at least 10 nations, most of them in South America, according to the International Trade Outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean 2023 report by the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).
From 2010 to 2022, the region accounted for nearly one-third of China’s food imports. Brazil alone supplied about 21% of those imports over the same period.

“In recent years, there has been significant growth in telecommunications projects and across all areas of transportation – including airports, ports, roads, railways, and subways – as well as in sanitation and urban mobility. These sectors account for nearly 60% of the total number of projects,” said José Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs, executive secretary of ECLAC, who highlighted the scale of China’s involvement during the 2024 International Seminar on Contemporary China Studies in Costa Rica.
China has viewed Brazil as a strategic partner for several years, primarily because of its soybean supply, and has responded with infrastructure investments, according to Fernando Bastiani, a researcher with ESALQ-LOG, the Group of Research and Extension in Agroindustrial Logistics at the University of São Paulo.
“Today, COFCO has direct access to farmers, purchases soybeans, and oversees the entire commercialization chain, including storage and transport to China,” Bastiani said. “In recent years, [COFCO] has also realized it needs to control logistics systems and infrastructure, because that’s a key part.”
In Brazil, Bastiani explained, logistics costs account for 20% to 25% of the final soybean price, mainly due to the long distances between farms and ports and the high cost of trucking. “China understood that by investing in infrastructure, it could help make Brazil more competitive,” he said.
In May, the two countries signed new agreements to deepen their agricultural trade ties, granting Brazil authorization to export meat and ethanol byproducts. 
“Amid the changing and turbulent international landscape, China and Brazil should remain committed to the original aspiration of contributing to human progress and global development,” said President Xi Jinping during the meeting.
China’s pullback squeezes U.S. port volumes  
While Latin America has seen growth, many U.S. ports have experienced a significant decline in business.
At the New Orleans District — a dominant grain corridor — soybean exports grew by less than 3% between September 2024 and September 2025, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Shipments through the Los Angeles District fell almost 15%, while the steepest drop came in the Seattle District, where exports plunged 81%.
Nearly half of all U.S. corn, soybean and wheat exports move through the Mississippi River system, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s Market Intel report.

This major inland trade artery connects the Midwest’s farming regions to the Gulf of Mexico, carrying an average of 65 million metric tons annually of bulk agricultural products by barge over the past five years to export terminals near New Orleans, where shipments depart for international markets.
“The facilities that purchase soybeans from farmers extend to our freight railroads, where they don’t have as much volume that they’ve been moving, at least for soybeans,” said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition. 
Steenhoek noted that corn exports have remained strong, which has helped sustain some port activity — but it hasn’t solved the underlying problem: “China imports more U.S. soybeans than all of our other international customers combined,” he said.
At the Port of Los Angeles, the largest container port in the Western Hemisphere, agricultural exports have also weakened as trade with China cools.
“Exports in general have been very soft and we attributed it to the retaliatory tariffs that have been put in place by China,” said Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. “Our single biggest export sector is agriculture … of that, soybeans are the number one export commodity.”
Before the first tariffs were introduced in 2018, China accounted for about 60% of the port’s business. Today, it’s closer to 40% and falling, as trade flows and sourcing shift toward countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand. 
“We’ve been very aggressive in finding cargo out of other countries,” Seroka said. “But there is no doubt in my mind that we are concerned every day that these policies could impact the amount of cargo that comes to Los Angeles.”
The decrease in exports is not just a hit to farmers, but also to port workers; each four containers handled at the port generates one job, according to Seroka.
“In Southern California, one in nine people has a job related to this port,” said Seroka, referring to dockworkers, truck drivers, brokers and warehouse employees. “It truly is a conversation of national significance.”
U.S. port traffic isn’t poised for a quick rebound despite a recent trade agreement that ends China’s suspension of U.S. soybean imports. After six months of near-zero shipments due to retaliatory trade measures, Beijing in November agreed to purchase 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the final two months of 2025 and to commit to annual purchases of at least 25 million tons through 2028.

A recent analysis from Purdue University’s Center for Commercial Agriculture and farmdoc Daily said the announcement offered some relief to U.S. farmers at the tail end of harvest, but overall exports to China this year are still on track to be the weakest since 2018, when trade tensions during the first Trump administration slashed volumes to 8 million tons.
“It is very difficult to take a market [China] of over a billion people and replace that,” said John Bartman, a soybean farmer from Marengo, Illinois.
By October, Brazil had exported a record 79 million metric tons of soybeans to China, nearly 80% of its total soybean shipments during the period, according to a farmdoc Daily analysis of data from Brazil’s Foreign Trade Secretariat. Brazil’s total soybean exports reached about 100 million tons between January and October, already surpassing the country’s full-year total for 2024, which was just under 99 million tons.
“U.S. soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice,” Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association, wrote in a statement. 
US trade strategy remains unsettled as China moves ahead
While China builds long-term infrastructure to secure its supply chains, Washington is still struggling to define its trade strategy and to contain the political fallout of renewed tariffs.
In mid-September, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives moved to block Congress from influencing Trump’s tariff policy, even as Senate Democrats prepared to force votes challenging his trade war, The New York Times reported. The maneuver effectively stripped lawmakers of the ability to advance measures to lift tariffs until March 31, 2026, extending a prohibition first imposed in the spring to spare members from taking a politically difficult vote.
“Tariffs not only cause farmers to pay more for their inputs, but they have also seen tariffs reduce markets for U.S. farm products,” said U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, during an October session.

If the November soybean agreement between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping holds, Beijing’s purchases would still fall short of recent norms. Even if China buys at least 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually over the next three years, that volume would remain about 14% below the five-year average shipped to China from 2020 to 2024, according to an analysis from Purdue University’s Center for Commercial Agriculture and farmdoc daily.
Some purchases have started rolling in. But April Hemmes, an Iowa soybean farmer who has promoted increased trade with China, said the agreement would be difficult to fulfill, noting that delivering 12 million metric tons of soybeans by early next year is “not very realistic.”  
As China establishes new trade routes across Latin America, every new port or shipping lane makes a future recovery for U.S. farmers more challenging.
Despite the tensions, Hemmes still views China as an essential market. 
“I don’t think our relationship with China has been damaged,” the Iowa soybean farmer said. “China is a low-cost buyer and will need soybeans from the U.S. for a long time. But we will never be their number one source.”
For her, the changing politics and policies have made the United States an “unreliable trading partner.”
“The only way that we become their top choice would be if our soybeans were far cheaper than South America’s.”

Tennessee House Republican leaders will push forward a plan in 2026 to install a Memphis-Shelby County schools oversight panel that would seize significant decision-making authority from the locally elected school board.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton and education committee Chairman Mark White confirmed this month they are committed to working with the Senate to pass a form of takeover legislation in the 2026 legislative session.
Republicans in the two chambers failed to find a compromise after passing differing versions of the bill earlier this year amid ongoing frustrations with school board governance and academic performance issues. If lawmakers can agree this year, change could come quickly to Memphis-Shelby County schools, which is already primed for major upheaval in 2026.
White’s plan would essentially install a governing oversight board with the authority to veto part or all of the local school board’s budget, the largest single decision the school board is responsible for.
White argued the oversight board must have the “teeth” to make significant district decisions, compared to the 2025 Senate version of the plan that would operate as an advisory board.










I don’t believe an elected school board can fix decades of bureaucracy.


– Rep. Mark White, R-Memphis


The oversight board under White’s plan would also have approval authority for any contracts or expenses larger than $50,000 and essentially control final charter decisions in the district. White’s proposal would institute the board for three years, with the potential for another three-year extension.
“Putting a board in place that has no authority to do anything is a waste of time,” Sexton said. “It does nothing. If you’re going to put it in, then you’ve got to trust them to make the decisions.”
Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican carrying the Senate version of the bill, did not respond to a request for comment.
The Senate and House passed differing versions of the legislation in 2025, with the two chambers at odds over details of oversight board authority.
If Senate and House leaders can come to a compromise on the legislation when the General Assembly reconvenes in mid-January, it could quickly be passed into law. Because the bills are still live, the chambers could hash out any changes in conference without reverting back to a lengthy legislative committee process.
Potential oversight changes would be one of several significant changes on the horizon for Memphis schools.
The early 2025 firing of former Superintendent Marie Feagins ignited long-simmering dissatisfaction with the school board and triggered both local and state backlash. Now, all nine seats on the board are up for election in 2026, meaning Memphis voters may go to the primary ballot box this spring to vote for a board whose governing power could soon be greatly diminished under the legislative plan.
The board must also make a decision on the interim superintendent’s contract sometime in 2026.
White said he will move “full speed ahead” to enact “drastic” changes.
“I don’t believe an elected school board can fix decades of bureaucracy. I’m not putting blame on any past or present school board,” White said.
Legislative Democrats and Memphis-Shelby County school leaders have sharply criticized the takeover effort as political overreach, pointing to previous state takeover failures in the Achievement School District and incremental progress the district has made recently.
“State intervention in Memphis schools has historically failed to improve outcomes,” Memphis-Shelby County schools interim Superintendent Roderick Richmond said during a fall community meeting.
Launched a decade ago, the Achievement School District took control of low-performing schools and often turned them over to the charter operators. But the state intervention model led to no meaningful long-term improvements for students, research showed, and often sparked community backlash for takeovers in low-income neighborhoods.
Memphis schools have had some growth in recent years. This year, MSCS students outpaced the state average for academic growth in reading and math. More Memphis schools also earned top marks in Tennessee’s report card system for the 2024-2025 school year.
Tennessee lawmakers file Memphis Shelby Schools “hostile takeover” at last minute

Yet the district continues to lag significantly in academic achievement, with less than 25% of MSCS students meeting grade level benchmarks in reading and math on state tests.
Sexton suggested any improvement is too little, too late after decades of underperformance in the state’s largest school district.
Republicans are also eyeing an ongoing state financial audit of the district, though both Sexton and White said the takeover legislation would move ahead regardless of those findings.
White has denied that the legislation amounts to a state takeover, given that members of the governing board must be residents of Shelby County. White says he, along with other Memphis natives, believe “we have to have local intervention.”
But under White’s 2025 bill, the appointing power for the oversight board would sit in state government and, by extension, give the Republican Party governing authority of local schools in a majority Democratic county.
Under the House bill, the Tennessee governor would appoint five members, and the House and Senate speakers would receive two appointments each.
Critics of the legislation have also warned the measure could have ripple effects beyond Memphis and encroach on local control in other areas of the state, though the legislation currently only applies to Shelby County. White’s 2025 legislation could trigger an oversight board in a local district if:

50% or more of enrolled students did not meet state testing grade level expectations.
30% or more of schools in a district receive a D or F state letter grade.
25% or more of students enrolled were chronically absent in the most recent school year.
One or more schools have been identified as a priority school by the state education department.
And the local legislative body of the county approves a resolution of no confidence in the local school board.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin are pushing for the release of Jaciel Cirrus Rojas, who has been held in immigration detention since June. Rojas, a Mexican-born man who has lived in the U.S. since 2018, has no criminal record, Urban Milwaukee reported, and was arrested by immigration officers despite not being the target of their operation. 
An immigration judge ordered  Cirrus Rojas  released on  bond in July. But the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appealed his release and Cirrus Rojas remains in the Dodge County Jail. 
The judge’s order was vacated by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), followed by the denial of a federal court petition challenging the legality of Cirrus Rojas’ detention. Cirrus Rojas has had no contact with his wife and infant daughter for the 200 days during  which he has been detained. 
ACLU attorneys working for his release, say  Cirrus Rojas has a pending asylum claim and is  at risk of being tortured if deported to his home country. The hearing for Cirrus Rojas’ asylum claim has been rescheduled. Earlier this month, ACLU attorney Jennifer Bizzotto filed an emergency motion in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals pushing to overturn previous denials to release Rojas. 
“We have seen hundreds of cases nationwide in which federal judges have ruled that [immigration enforcement] cannot hold people in Cirrus Rojas’ position without bond hearings, and that has not deterred [immigration enforcement] from continuing to lock up people while flagrantly violating the law,” ACLU staff attorney Hannah Schwarz said in a statement.

An ever larger portion of ICE arrests involve people like Cirrus Rojas  who have no   criminal record

( Getty Images)Bestowing fanciful, pointed presents to Kentucky public figures at Christmastime, through the lens of current events, is a 45-year-old tradition for this column — inaugurated by the late Ed Ryan, continued by his successors at the Courier-Journal’s Frankfort Bureau, and by your humble servant for most of that span. This year, with some help from anonymous elves, we start in Frankfort and move on to Washington.
Gov. Andy Beshear: Two weeks in California, to better understand Gov. Gavin Newsom, perhaps his leading rival for Democrats’ 2028 presidential nomination. I always thought a smart-ass such as Newsom couldn’t be elected president, but Donald Trump has lowered the bar for presidential behavior.
Secretary of State Michael Adams: In rejecting Justice Department demands for private data on Kentucky voters, the Republican qualified for a JFK Profile in Courage Award, but he got that one for real last year, so he gets a knock-off of the Heisman Trophy for giving Trumpers a stiff arm.
Former attorney general Daniel Cameron, U.S. Senate candidate: A copy of “Fundraising for Dummies.” Cameron’s no dummy, and has led in polls, but has had trouble raising money.
Businessman Nate Morris: A Trump Casino Hotel bag, to signify baggage that he (or any winner of the Republican Senate primary) may carry if the president keeps spiraling downward in so many ways.
U.S. Rep. Andy Barr of the 6th District, the primary’s betting favorite: A bottle of Canadian whiskey, which seems to have overtaken bourbon as Canadians’ drink of choice due to Trump’s tariffs, which Barr supported “100%” in April.
Fifth District Rep. Hal Rogers, who is running for a 24th term, will turn 88 Dec. 31, and votes pretty much the way his Trumpy district wants though he’s long been in the Chowder and Marching Club of Republican traditionalists: A framed photo of the late Sen. John Sherman Cooper, his fellow Somerset townsman, to remind him of his roots.
Fourth District Rep. Thomas Massie: A good-luck charm in his primary race with Trump-endorsed Ed Gallrein of Shelbyville. Massie gives voters of all stripes plenty to disagree with, but is perhaps the greatest example of independence from the executive branch that we need in Congress to maintain our democratic republic. His libertarian soulmate, Sen. Rand Paul, has done much of that, too.
Third District Rep. Morgan McGarvey: A holiday gift basket to pass along to his former colleagues in the state legislature, who seem to have resisted pressure from the Trump White House to carve up the Louisville district of the only Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation, like Tennessee gerrymandered Nashville.
Second District Rep. Brett Guthrie: A model of a Ford F-150 Lightning, which the company will stop making as it cuts its losses on electric vehicles and its huge new battery plant in Guthrie’s district. Beshear, looking to shift blame for a bad bet, pointed at Guthrie and Trump, citing Guthrie’s vote for the Trump bill that passed the House by one vote and cut EV subsidies. Guthrie replied, “Mandating everybody buy an electric car is not what the American people want.” That was a mandate in Europe, not the U.S.; Joe Biden did allow such a mandate in California, which has great market influence.
First District Rep. James Comer: An Autopen signature machine, like the one he accused the Biden White House of misusing, so he can get more familiar with the device as he aims toward his 2027 goal of becoming governor — an office in which the Autopen is frequently used.
Sen. Mitch McConnell: As he and wife Elaine Chao contemplate retirement, a cannabis sativa plant to practice the horticulture needed to keep it under 0.3 percent THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. That’s the limit set for hemp products by his 2018 legislation, which opened a loophole for producers of concentrated cannabinoid products — which McConnell and others closed recently, while delaying the change for a year to allow the issue to be fully lobbied and negotiated.
All members of Kentucky’s delegation: A district-by-district, county-by-county list of the numbers of Kentuckians (more than 100,000 overall) who have used extra Biden-era premium subsidies to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and the impact of their expiration. Comer, whose district would be hit hardest, has said the subsidies should be extended a year or two, but Guthrie, chairman of the House committee that handles health care, has been quiet.

(Photo by Gary Cifers/Getty Images)It’s late afternoon, the last workday before Christmas break at the headquarters of Virginia’s Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Its chairman and head honcho, Tim Hugo, is tidying up his office and about to grab his coat and head home when the intercom on his desk phone buzzes.
“Mr. Hugo, a Mr. Schneiderman from Dewey, Screwum & Howe on line two for you,” says a woman’s voice with a sweet Southside lilt.
Not the start to the holiday season the chairman hoped for. There were parties to attend. Celebrations to be had. The boss was ready to start a jolly, relaxing winter respite. This call from a notorious litigation firm could not bring good tidings of great joy. It would be a total buzzkill after a buoyant month for Virginia’s state-run distilled spirits monopoly.
A couple of days after Thanksgiving, a masked bandit had broken into the ABC’s Ashland store one night and ransacked it, treating himself to a legendary bender before passing out next to the store’s commode from the booze he had plundered. Because the burglar was a cuddly, furry raccoon, pictures and videos of the crime and its adorable perpetrator went viral online and generated global press coverage, giving the ABC an unprecedented marketing bonanza that money couldn’t buy.
Or could it?
“Can this wait?” Hugo asked the receptionist.
“He says it’s a pressing matter concerning the misappropriation of someone’s likeness, Tim.”
Hugo sighs and rolls his eyes. Lawyers, am I right? He lifted the receiver and pressed the blinking button for line two.
“Season’s greetings, Mr. Hugo, and here’s wishing us all a prosperous new year,” Schneiderman said.
“Us?” Hugo said.
“Sure. You. Me. The ABC. The state treasury. And, as of a couple of hours ago, my client — Mr. Rupert D. Raccoon, whose name, image and likeness you and/or your designees, among others, have gratuitously exploited for crass commercial gain without Mr. Raccoon’s knowledge or consent,” Schneiderman sneered. “And then, he’s given this defamatory nickname: ‘Trashed Panda!’ Do you know how offensive it is to raccoons to be called pandas?”
Hugo muttered something unprintable under his breath. How, he wondered, had something so perfect turned so rancid so fast? There would be no merry neighborhood wassailing this frosty night.
In a hollow tree in a wooded buffer abutting an affluent residential subdivision in the Richmond suburb of Hanover County, Rupert D. Raccoon was regaling a gaze of his closest masked, ring-tailed friends and kin with tales of his late Ashland adventure.
“Y’all brag about your legendary college parties, but answer me this: How many of you broke into a liquor store — Mission Impossible-style! — drank half its inventory and passed out on the concrete floor inches from the commode?” Rupert said.
It was no rhetorical question. Rupert was serious. Newly enrolled in a 12-step program, yes, but darn serious! They looked at him, spellbound and wide-eyed.
“So, you dropped in from the ceiling, then what? — just started chugging bottles of Patron tequila? Glenlivet scotch? Blanton’s bourbon?” asked Oscar, Rupert’s first cousin.
“Nah. That’s top-shelf stuff. Not that I didn’t try. In my advanced inebriation, the only bottles I could knock over, break and slurp off the floor were lower-shelf brands — rail liquor at a bar,” Rupert said. “Couldn’t beat the price, though.”
That evoked a round of snickers and titters.
“How’d you like the drunk tank, rookie?” scoffed Karla, a tattooed, hard-partying sow who called herself “the Godzilla of Tequila Shots.” All the boars knew better than to challenge her.
“I woke up behind bars starving, my head’s pounding, and everybody in there was howling or barking super loud,” Rupert said. “One of my captors sees me looking like death warmed over, snatches me up and stuffs me in a county truck. I’m begging him for a chalupa and Diet Coke from the Taco Bell drive-thru, but no! A few miles later, he pulls over, turns me loose on the side of the road and warns me to stay out of Ashland.”
Felix, one of the more youthful and inquisitive of Rupert’s crew, had scaled a five-foot wooden privacy fence and nestled himself on one of the support posts to see what was playing on the 75-inch flat screen that covered most of one wall in some suburban family’s Florida room. It was tuned to “Inside Edition,” and what Felix saw stunned him.
“Rupe!” Felix yelled over his shoulder. “You’re gonna wanna see this.”
Rupert joined Felix on the fence line in time to glimpse a photo of himself passed out belly-down on a restroom floor between a toilet and a waste can, his four legs splayed helplessly in varied directions. Grainy, monochrome security camera footage showed Rupert reeling and lurching, hither and yon, after hours in the ABC store amid $250 or more worth of spilled hootch from shattered bottles. 
Then the image shifted to a winsome AI rendering of Rupert’s face hawking various ABC liquor deals and cocktail recipes. They were selling T-shirts and other swag bearing his caricature. The chyron in the screen’s bottom third read “‘Trashed Panda’ Nets $180K for Va. Animal Shelter.”
“What the (censored)?” Rupert said. “Where’s my cut?”

Harvey Schneiderman had been browbeating and trying to intimidate Hugo for nearly 30 minutes. He told Hugo that his client, Rupert, had rights! He would not be involuntarily used as some monopoly agency’s unpaid marketing pitchcritter!
“He’s a freakin’ raccoon, Harvey! A small, carnivorous, largely nocturnal creature of the wild!” Chairman Hugo said, his patience wearing thin.
“Yeah and just a few years ago, colleges and the NCAA told ballplayers they had no right to share in the hundreds of millions of bucks EA Sports and Nintendo raked in from depicting those players in video games, right down to their jersey numbers and tattoos, until a unanimous Supreme Court saw it differently,” Schneiderman countered.
“You can’t plausibly compare a wild animal to Heisman Trophy candidates,” Hugo protested, his face reddening.
“Let’s see what a jury says,” Schneiderman shot back. “Mr. Raccoon may be a small woodland dweller who feeds largely on frogs, freshwater crustaceans, the occasional discarded chalupa or whatever he can scavenge from trash cans, but look at that sweet little face splashed all over your merch and advertising. It’s a face a jury would love, Mr. Hugo. Maybe a face worth six or even seven figures if we go to court.”
“OK, Harvey,” an exasperated Chairman Hugo said. “Fax me your settlement offer. We’ll be in touch early next year.”
“No, you’ll be in touch now or we file tomorrow because I know that after January 17th, the Republican governor who appointed you leaves office, a Democrat takes over, and … well, I don’t have to tell you about political spoils,” Schneiderman said.
Hugo tried to speak calmly through his clenched teeth. “OK, your client gets a handle of Ancient Age whiskey a month and free chalupas for life — our best and final.”
“Toss in a subscription to Animal Planet and we’ve got a deal,” the wily litigator said.
Hugo grunted his grudging assent and hung up. Lawyers! Bah! Humbug!

(Photo courtesy of Carrie Wright)As the year ends, we’re taking an opportunity to highlight our favorite stories of 2025. 
Whitney Downard came to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star from our sister outlet in Indiana, starting the day before the November election. 
I thought with only two months of Whitney’s work to choose from, picking a favorite would be simple. That’s not the case, but I settled on this great article about an Allegheny County couple, Jaime and Carrie Wright, who are already juggling copays and debt to pay for Jaime’s cancer treatment regimen.
Juggling will turn into struggling next year when the Wrights’ health insurance premium increases by 265% as a result of Congress not renewing Affordable Care Act tax credits that reduce the cost of health insurance purchased through the state exchange, Pennie.
The Wrights’ story is one that shows how political and policy decisions at the highest levels of government affect people that we as journalists strive to tell. In this case, the Washington, D.C., lawmakers’ decision not to extend the tax credits will upend the personal finances of 500,000 people across the commonwealth who rely on Pennie to afford health insurance.

Congressional health insurance tug-o-war puts Pennsylvanians in a lurch


Emily Previti also joined the Capital-Star this year, bringing years of experience as a journalist for print and public media organizations.
In this article, Emily examines the state of the decades-long effort by Pennsylvania advocates and lawmakers to establish a system to compensate people who have been released from prison after being wrongfully convicted of a crime. 
While many states have a mechanism to provide monetary compensation for lost years behind bars, Pennsylvania does not. But the proposal introduced this year contains a phrase that could present an insurmountable legal barrier for those entitled to compensation.
While a conviction can be reversed on the basis of new evidence that creates reasonable doubt about a person’s culpability for a crime, the compensation bill now under consideration requires proof of actual innocence, which would put redress beyond the reach of many exonerees.
This is an issue that I’ve covered in the past and Emily’s story shows that more work needs to be done by lawmakers’ to reach a workable solution.

Ian Karbal wrote about a $5 million Easter egg in the state budget for William Penn School District in Delaware County, which is represented in the state House by Democratic Speaker Joanna McClinton.
By asking questions, Ian revealed that the extra money was a result of direct advocacy by members of the school board. 
William Penn was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the state that led to the historic court ruling that Pennsylvania’s reliance on real estate tax to fund schools unconstitutionally deprives students in the least wealthy districts of educational opportunities.
The district was among those forced to borrow money to sustain operations as a result of this year’s five-month budget impasse. 
It was also reeling from the discovery of a $9.2 million bookkeeping error that forced district officials to consider cutting staff, including administrators and academic interventionists who work one-on-one with struggling students.
The story shows how the budget process sometimes comes down to asking the right person for money and that the state’s least funded school districts are still fighting to stabilize their finances two years after winning a judgment against the commonwealth.

Our editor Tim Lambert doesn’t have bylines every week, but this two-part story from June is an epic account of the role Pennsylvania soldiers played in liberating a small French town in the Battle of Normandy and the bond they share with people of Gathemo to this day.
“The men and women of Gathemo have never forgotten the men who wore the red keystone patch – dubbed the “bloody bucket” by the Germans – on their shoulders,” Tim wrote. 
The first installment, published to mark the unveiling of a monument to the men from Pennsylvania’s 28th Infantry Division who died there, tells the story of people on both sides of the Atlantic who worked to uncover the stories of the nine men, connect with their relatives and make the memorial reality.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)The conservation group Wild Virginia has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, alleging the agency failed to protect Virginia’s rivers and streams from PFAS, commonly known as “forever chemicals.”
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are harmful chemicals linked to manufacturing runoff, fire fighting materials, and everyday consumer products such as water resistant clothing and nonstick cookware. Exposure to PFAS has been associated with serious health risks, including cancer and reduced fertility in women.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Eastern District Court of Virginia, challenges the EPA’s approval of the state’s 2024 water quality report. Wild Virginia argues that the federal agency should have intervened after concluding that Virginia did not do enough to address contaminated waterways. State data shows that several rivers and streams are polluted with PFAS, including the Middle Chickahominy River, which has been under PFAS investigation since 2021. 
The EPA has kept National Primary Drinking Water Regulations in place for several PFAS chemicals, establishing limits for what is considered safe in drinking water. However, there are thousands of different PFAS compounds, and regulations often lag behind emerging contamination, leaving many chemicals unregulated. 
The complaint points to six years of PFAS data collected by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality that identified multiple streams with elevated levels of the chemicals. Despite those findings, the lawsuit alleges, some waterways were not classified as “impaired” in the state’s water quality report. 
In one case, PFAS levels were so high in the Chichahominy River and White Oak Swamp that DEQ issued a fish tissue consumption advisory in May 2025. The lawsuit claims that despite those warnings, the waters were not listed as impaired in the final report submitted to the EPA.
“There are many other waters around the state where they have data showing PFAS contamination in the surface waters themselves,” said David Sligh, the water quality program director for Wild Virginia. “They mentioned PFAs in their report, they really didn’t do any analysis as to what that means or how those are related to their own water quality standards.”
The EPA finalized its rule on PFAS exposure in drinking water in April 2024.
In its report, the Virginia DEQ wrote: “In December 2024, EPA published draft recommended water quality criteria protective of human health for PFOA, PFOS, and PFBS. These criteria are designed specifically to protect public water supplies and fish consumption and reflect a lifetime exposure duration of 70 years. These criteria will not be considered for adoption in Virginia’s water quality standards regulation until they are finalized by EPA. Once effective they would be used to assess waters in subsequent integrated reports.”
Sligh said that the EPA was “required to acknowledge, assess and designate waters that are impaired if their narrative water quality criteria are violated, those criteria say if there are pollutants that are causing toxic or harmful conditions for humans or wildlife, then they’re supposed to count those as standards violations. And so that hasn’t changed, and they didn’t need to wait on anything from the EPA.” 
The EPA approved Virginia’s water quality report in July 2025. According to Wild Virginia, the agency acknowledged the state’s PFAS contamination but declined to take enforcement action. 
The group argues in its lawsuit that the decision will delay required pollution controls while residents of the commonwealth will continue to be exposed to the chemicals. 
The complaint further alleges that the EPA’s inaction violates the federal Clean Water Act. The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the agency to identify the PFAS-impaired waters so that pollution reduction plans can be developed and implemented.
In 2024, the Virginia General Assembly passed a law intended to create a statewide plan to  address elevated PFAS levels in waterways and identify pollution sources through self reporting requirements.

For years, a team of experts has traveled from tiny town to tiny town in New Hampshire, helping the communities plan and execute clean energy strategies. Now the idea has secured federal funding to expand nationwide — a notable win as the Trump administration claws back billions of dollars for decarbonization policy.






The $3 million in funding was included in the fiscal 2026 agriculture spending package that President Donald Trump signed into law last month as part of the bill that reopened the government after the shutdown this fall. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from the Granite State, led the push for the pilots, which could help municipalities not only cut greenhouse gas emissions but save money as energy costs rise nationwide.


“It’s very exciting to us that Sen. Shaheen saw what we were doing and saw the potential,” said Sarah Brock, director of the New Hampshire program, dubbed Energy Circuit Rider. ​“It would be amazing to have versions of this program scattered across the country to help communities understand and find solutions to whatever their energy challenges are.”


Shaheen’s office hopes to get the program — which will be administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service — up and running within the next year. Because it is a pilot, it does not have to go through the same extensive regulatory processes as other programs, which should allow a relatively timely implementation, a Senate aide said.


Shaheen originally proposed a national version of the program with an annual budget of $25 million in standalone legislation in 2023, and again in June 2025, before pushing to include the smaller pilot in November’s spending bill.


“The commonsense energy circuit riders pilot is an important and effective way for communities to get the tools they need to take on clean energy and energy efficiency projects that lower costs,” Shaheen said in a statement to Canary Media.


The seeds of New Hampshire’s program were planted roughly a decade ago, as towns and cities across the state formed energy committees tasked with lowering power bills and emissions, Brock said. Clean energy advocates began talking about how to support these groups, which were made up of volunteers with widely varying levels of expertise, and which often served small towns without the resources to hire staff focused on energy issues.


The conversation turned to the idea of hiring a ​“circuit rider,” a position modeled on the traveling preachers, judges, and doctors of centuries past, who provided their services to communities along their route. In 2018, the Neil and Louise Tillotson Fund, a foundation that supports causes in New Hampshire’s rural north, funded a position for a full-time clean energy expert who would provide knowledge and support to any town in the region at no cost. Nonprofit Clean Energy New Hampshire agreed to host the new hire.







The first energy circuit rider, Melissa Elander, had a mission statement but no real guidance on how to do her new job. She spent her first year introducing herself to towns throughout the region, offering her services as a researcher, consultant, and grant writer, and she slowly began to rack up some wins, Brock said. The first initiative she supported was an energy-efficient lighting project for the town of Whitefield, population 2,500.














“As word of those successes spread, more and more communities were interested,” Brock said. ​“It was clear to us there was something here.”


Today, the program has six energy circuit riders on staff, including Elander. It has expanded to cover all of the state’s 234 municipalities — 138 of which the program has provided support for — as well as small businesses. The team has helped towns navigate a wide range of projects, including weatherization of public buildings, solar installations, and planning for fleet electrification. Clean Energy New Hampshire does not have complete data, but estimates that just 41% of completed projects have yielded $4.26 million in total savings for municipalities.


The program was vital to the successful completion of an all-electric, solar-powered library in the community of Barrington, said Cynthia Hoisington, chair of the town’s energy committee. The municipality worked with an energy circuit rider to manage the process of accepting bids and choosing a vendor for the solar installation.


“You need a trusted expert in these special-knowledge situations when you want to make sure you’re doing what’s right for your town,” Hoisington said. ​“The bottom line is a lot of this never would’ve gotten done without their help.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)GOP reversals in this year’s elections, especially in some urban and immigrant communities, are setting off alarm bells for Republicans using redistricting to try to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterms.
Redistricting plans demanded by President Donald Trump in states such as Texas and Missouri — meant to capitalize on his stronger showing among certain urban voters in the 2024 election — could backfire, as cities in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia returned to Democratic voting patterns in off-year elections this past November.
Experts see the shift as a sign of possible souring on the administration’s immigration enforcement agenda, combined with disappointment in economic conditions.
An ever-larger share of ICE’s arrested immigrants have no criminal record

Paul Brace, an emeritus political science professor of legal studies at Rice University in Houston, said Texas Republicans are likely to gain less than they imagine from new maps designed to pick up five additional seats for the party. He said minority voters’ interest in Trump was “temporary” and that he had underperformed on the economy.
“Trump’s redistricting efforts are facing headwinds and, even in Texas, may not yield all he had hoped,” Brace said.
Redistricting efforts in Texas spawned a retaliatory plan in California aimed at getting five more Democratic seats. Other states have leapt into the fray, with Republicans claiming an overall edge of three potential seats in proposed maps.
Cuban-born Jose Arango, chair of the Hudson County Republican Party in New Jersey, said immigration enforcement has gone too far and caused a backlash at the polls.
“There are people in the administration who frankly don’t know what the hell is going on,” Arango said. “If you arrest criminals, God bless you. We don’t want criminals in our streets. But then you deport people who have been here 30 years, 20 years, and have contributed to society, have been good people for the United States. You go into any business in agriculture, the hospitality business, even the guy who cuts the grass — they’re all undocumented. Who’s going to pick our tomatoes?”
As immigration arrests increase this year, a growing share of those detained have no criminal convictions.
New Jersey’s 9th Congressional District, which includes urban Paterson, went from a surprising Trump win last year to a lopsided victory this year for Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill. Trump won the district last year by 3 percentage points and Sherrill won by 16 points. The district is majority-minority and 39% immigrant.
There was a similar turnaround in Miami, a majority-immigrant city that elected a Democratic mayor for the first time in almost 30 years. Parts of immigrant-rich Northern Virginia also shifted in the governor’s race there.











There is an element of Trump-curious minority voters staying home this year.


– J. Miles Coleman, an associate editor at the University of Virginia Center for Politics



In the New Jersey district, Billy Prempeh, a Republican whose parents emigrated from Ghana, lost a surprisingly close 2024 race for U.S. House to Democrat Nellie Pou, of Puerto Rican descent, who became the first Latina from New Jersey to serve in Congress.
Prempeh this year launched another campaign for the seat, but withdrew after Sherrill won the governor’s race, telling Stateline that any Republican who runs for that seat “is going to get slaughtered.”
Prempeh doesn’t blame Trump or more aggressive immigration enforcement for the shift. He said his parents and their family waited years to get here legally, and he objects to people being allowed to stay for court dates after they crossed the border with Mexico.
“We aren’t deporting enough people. Not everybody agrees with me on that,” Prempeh said.
Parts of Virginia saw similar voting pattern changes. Prince William County, south of Washington, D.C., saw support for Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger jump to 67% compared with 57% for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris last year. The county is about 26% immigrant and 27% Hispanic.
Asian American and Hispanic voters shifted more Democratic this year in both New Jersey and Virginia, said J. Miles Coleman, an associate editor at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, expanding on a November post on the subject.
However, some of those Virginia voters might have sat out the governor’s race, Coleman said.
“I do think there is an element of Trump-curious minority voters staying home this year,” Coleman said. “There were many heavily Asian and Hispanic precincts in Northern Virginia that saw this huge percentage swing from Harris to Spanberger, but also saw relatively weak turnout.”
The pattern is “hard to extrapolate” to Texas or other states with new maps, Coleman said, “but Democrats are probably liking what they saw in this year’s elections.”
He said one of the redrawn districts in Texas is now likely to go to Democrats: the majority-Hispanic 28th Congressional District, which includes parts of San Antonio and South Texas. And the nearby 34th Congressional District is now a tossup instead of leaning Republican, according to new Center for Politics projections.
More industries want Trump’s help hiring immigrant labor after farms get a break

The pattern in New Jersey’s 9th Congressional District this year was consistent in Hispanic areas statewide, according to an analysis provided to Stateline by Michael Foley, elections coordinator of State Navigate, a Virginia-based nonprofit that analyzes state election data.
New Jersey Hispanic precincts “swung heavily” toward Sherrill compared with their 2024 vote for Harris, Foley said in an email. He noted that New Jersey and Florida Hispanic populations are largely from the Caribbean and may not reflect patterns elsewhere, such as Texas where the Hispanic population is heavily Mexican American.
Pou, who won the New Jersey seat, said economics played a part in this year’s electoral shift.
“The President made a promise to my constituents that he’d lower costs and instead he’s made the problem worse with his tariffs that raised costs across the board,” Pou said in a statement to Stateline.
Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said immigration and pocketbook issues both played a role in places like the 9th District, as did an influx of Democratic campaign money.
“The biggest reason is a sense of letdown in President Trump,” Rasmussen said. “There were many urban voters who decided they liked what Trump was saying, they liked the Hispanic outreach, they bought into his economic message. And just one year later, they’re equally disillusioned.”

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderState officials have introduced a $1.4 billion plan to improve rural health outcomes over the next five years under the federal Rural Health Transformation Program created as part of this summer’s budget reconciliation bill.
In a 96-page application, officials from the state’s Department of Community Health requested funds to improve access to primary and specialty care in rural areas, strengthen telehealth infrastructure and recruit more health care providers across the state’s dozens of rural counties.
“Our broader vision is that rural populations are healthier, live longer, have an improved quality of life, and can both live and work in the communities they love,” said Stuart Portman, Georgia’s Medicaid director, during the Board of Community Health meeting this month.
Georgia’s rural counties face higher rates of poverty, heart disease and cancer than their urban counterparts, according to the state’s application for the program. Rural counties are also less likely to have pediatricians or OB/GYNs, and have lower rates of employee-sponsored health insurance.
There are limits to how Georgia can use the money, however. Funding must be allocated according to the program’s guidelines and will be subject to strict oversight by the federal government, Portman explained to the committee. The portion of money that goes to payments for health care providers, for instance, cannot exceed 15% of the total funds.
“We could not do things that created ongoing obligations for the state or the federal government,” Portman said. “Importantly, there’s a strong desire to not include things that create a [financial] cliff.”
There were also a few rules that echo larger priorities of President Donald Trump and his administration. Funds cannot be used toward gender-affirming care for children or adults and largely cannot be used to cover abortion care. Hospitals may also be required to collect information on patients’ immigration status to be eligible for reimbursement under the program.
All 50 states submitted applications for the program, which were due in early November. Half of the annual $10 billion in federal funding will be divided evenly among states with approved plans across a five-year period, and the rest will be awarded based on need, program design and federal scoring criteria. 
Officials at the Georgia Department of Community Health said the funds for the first year could be delivered by the end of the year.
How would Georgia’s rural health funding be allocated?
Georgia’s program, which state officials have named Georgia Rural Enhancement And Transformation of Health, or GREAT Health, would invest funds from the Rural Health Transformation Program across 29 separate projects, which fall into five major categories.


If approved, the largest bucket of funding, encompassing over $428 million, will be used to help up to 86 eligible hospitals transition to a program known as Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design, or the AHEAD Model. The program, which was created by the federal CMS Innovation Center, is designed to limit the growth of health care spending, in part by emphasizing primary and preventative care.
The program would also allocate $175 million toward improving hospital infrastructure in rural areas. The proposal would help fund electrical grid improvements, water and air quality assessments and other upgrades to ensure that facilities can weather severe storms and natural disasters without endangering patients or disrupting their care.
A proposed $148 million would go toward recruiting and retaining health care providers in rural areas by establishing 75 new residency slots each year in fields like family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics, as well as establishing a new rural recruitment incentive grant program for certain providers who agree to practice in rural areas for at least five years.
A few private organizations, including the Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals and the Georgia Hospital Association, also submitted letters as part of the state’s application for the program, alongside letters from state officials like Gov. Brian Kemp and Department of Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey.
HomeTown Health CEO Jimmy Lewis, who also signed onto the state’s application for the program, said he was glad to see such a comprehensive interest in rural health at the state and federal levels.
The funds, he added, “could help us offset some of the years-ago losses” that some of the rural hospitals in his network are facing.
H.R. 1 fallout
For proponents of the Rural Health Transformation Program, the estimated $1.4 billion in rural health funding comes as a much-needed reprieve for struggling providers.
But critics say the program won’t make up for drastic Medicaid funding cuts enshrined in the “one big, beautiful bill” that Trump signed into law over the summer. According to a new report from the Georgia Health Initiative, the state will lose an estimated $5.4 billion in Medicaid funding over the next 10 years as a result of the legislation, and 460,000 people will become uninsured.
Leah Chan, director of health justice at Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said that higher rates of uninsured Georgians could spell disaster for rural hospitals, many of which receive the vast majority of their funding from Medicaid payments. If that Medicaid funding is diminished, hospitals may be required to provide emergency care without any compensation.
“We know that many of those rural safety net hospitals are already under substantial pressure due in part to high uncompensated care costs,” Chan said. “The loss of the supplementary federal funds basically adds fuel to what is already a smoldering fire for us in terms of our health care system.”
Though some congressional Republicans billed the Rural Health Transformation Program as a solution to Medicaid funding cuts, Chan argued that the funds will not address the biggest issue facing rural hospitals.
“What we can see from the application is, in fact, these rural health transformation funds do not address the loss of these federal provider payments,” she said. “So essentially, our state is left to pick up the tab.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hospital-sign.jpg,,,2025-12-24 05:12:06.188775

Lubow Wolynetz has served as a curator with the Ukrainian Museum and Library in Stamford for over four decades. Many of the items in the collection were passed down, over generations and across continents, and they hold deep meaning, she said.
They are bits of the national identity Ukrainians are fighting to keep alive.
“We have duplicates and triplicates, but we save them so that when Ukraine — when they’re finally free — [we can] send it there,” she said.
Wolynetz said she believes the current war, and the hardships that have come with it, has elevated the art’s significance.

Among the variety of folk art showcased in the museum is row after row of colorful vyshyvankas — embroidered shirts made by artisans across Ukraine, from the Carpathian Mountains in the west to the rivers in the east, each with distinct patterns and styles.
“The Ukrainians were always a nation that was overpowered by a stronger nation. So most of the populace had to learn how to survive within the oppression of the powers,” Wolynetz said. “The way they did it is that they would stick to their traditions. And one of these traditions would be their outfits and the way they dress, the way they created things around them.”

Oleksandra Storchai, a senior research associate at the Ivan Honchar Museum in Kyiv, said Ukrainian history “has many tragic pages,” when it was taken over by outside interests. “Traditional folk culture was the only thing that helped to keep the identity,” she said.
Vyshyvankas have held a particular strength in that regard. According to the tradition, the embroidered patterns and designs serve as amulets meant to protect the wearer. 
“It has an inner meaning,” Storchai said. 
“It’s a much wider picture than just stitching,” Wolynetz said. “It’s one of the basic identities that we have.”

Threading old and new worlds
In West Hartford, retiree and artist Yelena Kirshon is working on curating her 12th Ukrainian art exhibition, set to take place in April. Kirshon, who grew up in Ukraine, also teaches folk art classes — focused on the Eastern painting style of Petrykivka — and sells handmade jewelry. 
Proceeds from those endeavors have been supporting the Fastiv School of Folk Crafts, in Fastiv, Ukraine — a town about 40 miles southwest of Kyiv, where Kirshon’s niece, Oksana Zuienko, is the director.

The school seeks to revive Ukrainian folk craft traditions, ranging from woodwork to embroidery, Zuienko said. Over 500 children attend its afterschool classes, and several former students have been recognized nationally for their work. (Kirshon is one of those former students — the school is where she learned Petrykivka painting.)
“Children delve into the roots of our past,” Zuienko said. “They know our customs and rituals. They know our symbolism.”
Of the school’s 18 teachers, most have a partner or relative on the frontline. The war’s impact on the school, however, doesn’t end there.

In early December, Fastiv suffered three consecutive nights of drone strikes. Explosions ripped through the approximately 45,000-person town, decimating the train station and train depot. At the Fastiv School of Folk Crafts, just half a mile from the impact, the blasts knocked canvases down from the walls. 
But the sleepless nights and the threat of more attacks failed to deter the school’s staff or students. On the day following the three-day strike, students dutifully filed into their classes after school. 
In one room, 7-year-old Nadiia honed her beading technique. In another, two young boys worked with clay, surrounded by the ceramic creations of their predecessors.
The money that Kirshon has raised in Connecticut made it possible for the school to add a toilet, which allowed younger children to enroll.

In the school’s main room, which doubles as a museum, sisters Alisa and Diana watched in a corner as their teachers assembled wheat in a typical holiday sheaf known as didukh. Around them, nearly every surface was adorned with embroidery, traditional easter eggs and paintings in the Petrykivka style.
Around 5 p.m., Fastiv went dark. Power cuts have become a daily occurrence in Ukraine, as Russia has targeted the nation’s energy infrastructure during cold months. Unable to continue teaching in the darkness, teachers sent the students home early. 
The neighborhood was submerged in darkness. Car headlights lit the streets, which were suffused with the hum of generators and the faint smell of gas.

Stitching together a community
Driving through the east side of Stamford, the grandeur of the stone manor at 161 Glenbrook Road stands out amidst rows of multi-family homes. The ornately decorated Stamford estate, which now serves as home to the Ukrainian Museum and Library, was purchased by Bishop Constantine Bohachevsky in 1933 with the intention of establishing a cultural institution. 
The collection sits beyond iron gates, down a winding driveway and through a heavy wooden door. Dozens of models and cases dispersed through wood-paneled rooms display colorful stitching from across Ukraine.
For Wolynetz, the vyshyvankas, in particular, hold deep personal significance. 
She first encountered embroidery as a displaced person living in Germany in the 1940s after fleeing her hometown in Western Ukraine during the Dnieper-Carpathian offensive. Growing up in a camp for displaced people, she observed as her mother and other women would gather to stitch clothing with distinct patterns from their hometowns. 
She recalled that her embroidery teacher in Germany would “pull up an old suitcase” to show the class examples of the craft. “And when I saw that, I just said, ‘When I grow up, I’m going to have the same kind of [suitcase.]”
Now in her 80s, Wolynetz teaches workshops in Ukrainian embroidery techniques in Connecticut and New York. And she proudly carries her own suitcase to class.
One series of those workshops recently took place this autumn at the Ukrainian Museum in New York, on the lower level of a building where traditional Ukrainian easter eggs, paintings and other art adorn the halls. Every week, over a dozen students gather to learn embroidery from Wolynetz. 

Patterns and colored threads spilled onto the table as she unzipped her suitcase at the start of the session. She was met with a mix of friendly chatter and technical questions from the students. Mostly women, with backgrounds ranging from Puerto Rican to Italian-American to Ukrainian, the students shared bits of their personal lives with each other amidst their triumphs and struggles with the craft.
“It’s one of those social groups that you wish was around more,” Wolynetz said.
One student, Jo Ann Radioli, said she found the class after joining an initiative to embroider amulets for soldiers fighting on the Ukrainian frontline. 
The samples that were mailed to her to replicate seemed daunting. “It was like jumping off the end of a diving board,” Radioli said. “Because I found Lubow, I felt I could do it.”
In the past, soldiers would go to war, return, and stop wearing embroidery. This practice was especially common after the first and second World Wars, where Ukrainians were forbidden from wearing vyshyvanka, and embroidered items were seized or destroyed. 
Storchai, of Kyiv’s Ivan Honchar Museum, said today’s war is different. Some Ukrainian soldiers are wearing embroidery under their military uniforms and even off the battlefield, she said. “It’s like spiritual armor.”

(Paramount)Along with millions of others, I’ll soon be taking 2 hours and 10 minutes out of my busy holiday schedule to sit down and watch a movie I’ve seen countless times before: Frank Capra’s “It’s a Wonderful Life,” which tells the story of a man’s existential crisis one Christmas Eve in the fictional town of Bedford Falls.

There are lots of reasons why this eight-decade-old film still resonates, from its nostalgic pleasures to its cultural critiques.
But when I watch it this year, the sequence where Bedford Falls transforms into the dark and dystopian “Pottersville” will resonate the most.
In the film, protagonist George Bailey, who’s played by Jimmy Stewart, is on the brink of suicide. He seems to have achieved the hallmarks of the American dream: He’s taken over his father’s loan business, married the love of his life and fathered four excessively adorable children. But George feels stifled and beaten down. His Uncle Billy has misplaced US$8,000 of the company’s money, and the town’s resident tyrant, Mr. Potter, is using the mishap to try to ruin George, who’s his last remaining business competitor.
An angel named Clarence is tasked with pulling George back from the brink. To stop him from attempting suicide, Clarence decides to show George what life would have been like if he’d never been born. In this alternate reality, Bedford Falls is called Pottersville, a place Mr. Potter runs as a ruthless banker and slumlord.
Pottersville, the dark, dystopian version of Bedford Falls, is a place characterized by vice and moral decay. (Paramount)
Having previously written about “It’s a Wonderful Life” in my book on literary and film censorship, I can’t help but see parallels between Pottersville and the U.S. today.
Think about it:
In Pottersville, one man hoards all the financial profits and political power.
In Pottersville, greed, corruption, and cynicism reign supreme.
In Pottersville, hard-working immigrants like Giuseppe Martini who were able to build a life and run a business in Bedford Falls have vanished.
In Pottersville, homeless addicts like Mr. Gower and nonconformist “pixies” like Clarence are scorned and ostracized, then booted out of the local watering hole.
In Pottersville, cops arrest people like Violet Bick while they’re at work and haul them away, kicking and screaming.
Violet Bick gets dragged away by the Pottersville police as George looks on. (Paramount)
But what horrifies George the most about Pottersville is how desensitized the people living in it seem to be to its harshness and cruelty – how they treat him like he’s the crazy, deranged one for wanting and expecting things to be different and better.
This is what the current political moment feels like to me. There are days when the latest headlines feel so jarringly unprecedented that I find myself thinking, “Can this be happening? Can this be real?”
If you think these comparisons are a bit of a stretch, consider when “It’s a Wonderful Life” was made, and the frame of mind Capra was in when he made it.
Frank Capra, anti-fascist
In 1946, Capra was just returning to Hollywood filmmaking after serving for four years in the U.S. Army, where the Office of War Information had tasked him with producing a series of documentary films about World War II and the lead-up to it. Even though Capra hadn’t been on the front lines, he’d been immersed in the sounds and images of war for years on end, and he had become acutely familiar with Germany, Italy and Japan’s respective rises to fascism.

When deciding on his first postwar film, Capra recalled in his autobiography that he specifically “knew one thing – it would not be about war.” Instead, he chose to adapt a short story by Philip Van Doren Stern, “The Greatest Gift,” that Stern had originally sent to friends and family as a Christmas card in 1943.
Stern’s story is certainly not about war. But it’s not exactly about Christmas, either.
As Stern writes in his opening lines:
“The little town straggling up the hill was bright with colored Christmas lights. But George Pratt did not see them. He was leaning over the railing of the iron bridge, staring down moodily at the black water.”
The protagonist contemplates suicide because he’s “sick of everything” in the small-town “mudhole” he’s stuck in – until, that is, a “strange little man” gives him the chance to see what life would be like if he’d never been born.
It was Capra and his team of screenwriters who added the sinister Henry F. Potter to Stern’s short, simple tale. The Potter subplot encapsulates the film’s most trenchant, still-resonant themes: the unfairness of socioeconomic injustices; the pervasiveness of corporate and political corruption; the threat of monopolized power; the need for affordable housing.
These themes had, of course, run through many of Capra’s prewar films as well: “Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,” “You Can’t Take It with You,” “Meet John Doe” and “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” the last of which also starred Jimmy Stewart.
But they take on a different kind of weight in “It’s a Wonderful Life” – a weight that’s especially visible on the weathered face of Stewart, who himself had just returned from a harrowing four-year tour of duty as a bomber pilot in Europe.
The idealistic vigor with which Stewart had fought crooked politicians and oligarchs as Mr. Smith is replaced by the bitterness, exhaustion, frustration and desperation with which he battles against Mr. Potter as George Bailey.
George Bailey feels helpless in the face of corruption and cruelty. (Paramount)
Life after Pottersville
By the time George has begged and pleaded his way out of Pottersville, the lost $8,000 is no longer top of mind. He’s mainly just relieved to find Bedford Falls as he had left it, warts and all.
And yet, the Bedford Falls that George returns to isn’t quite the same as the one he left behind.
In this Bedford Falls, the community rallies together to figure out a way to recoup George’s missing money. Their pre-digital version of a GoFundMe page saves George from what he’d feared most: bankruptcy, scandal and prison.
And even though his wife, Mary, tries to attribute this sudden wave of collectivist, activist energy to some sort of divine intervention – “George, it’s a miracle; it’s a miracle!” – Uncle Billy points out that it really came about through more earthly organizing means: “Mary did it, George; Mary did it! She told some people you were in trouble, and they scattered all over town collecting money!”
The residents of Bedford Falls come together to save George from financial ruin. (Paramount)
But the question of whether George actually wins his battle against Potter is a murky one.
While the typical Capra protagonist triumphs by defeating vice and exposing subterfuge, George never even realizes that Potter is the one who got hold of his money and tried to ruin his life. Potter is never held accountable for his crimes.
On the other hand, George is able to learn, from his time in Pottersville, what a crucial role he plays in his community. George’s victory over Potter, then, lies not in some grand final act of retribution, but in the incremental ways he has stood up to Potter throughout his life: not capitulating to Potter’s bullying or intimidation tactics; speaking truth to power; and running a community-centered business rather than one guided by greed and exploitation.
In recent months, there have been similar acts of protest, large and small, in the form of rallies, boycotts, immigrant aid efforts, subscription cancellations, food bank donations and more.
That doesn’t mean the U.S. has made it out of Pottersville, however.
Each day, more head-spinning headlines appear, whether they’re about masked agents terrorizing immigrant communities, the dismantling of anti-corruption oversights, the consolidation of executive power or the naked display of political grift.
Zuzu’s petals are still missing. Clarence still hasn’t gotten his wings.
But this holiday season, I’m hoping it will feel helpfully cathartic to go with George Bailey, for the umpteenth time, through the dark abyss of his dystopian nightmare – and come out with him, stronger and wiser, on the other side.

One drawback of working in the word business is that reading becomes just another part of the job. If you spend eight hours a day reading other people‘s writing, editing other people’s writing, or creating and editing your own writing, you might find it difficult to rouse yourself for other types of literature. Maybe you just want to watch “The Golden Girls.”
In essence, I read news and commentary pieces seven days a week, 365 days a year. Some of that writing amuses and diverts me. Some of it enrages me. A relatively small amount carries lasting aesthetic qualities.
I want to read other things. Yet even a nonfiction book can look like a daunting obstacle when the onrush of daily content piles up outside your door, a snowdrift of content that you then have to dig out with your eyes.
The struggle continues.
When I lived in New Hampshire, I was part of a book club that read an array of interesting modern fiction and nonfiction. We worked through “The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle” by Haruki Murakami, “Pale Fire” by Vladimir Nabokov, “Special Topics in Calamity Physics” by Marisha Pessl, “Dune” by Frank Herbert and many others.
More recently, my work on a volume for the University Press of Kansas about historic opinion writers has required leafing through dozens of old volumes. However, most of the time I use indexes and skimming to find useful nuggets.
After I finished writing the book, more or less, in September, I turned once again to reading fiction. I’ve stocked up on books I want to read but haven’t managed yet — “Catch-22” by Joseph Heller, “Beloved” by Toni Morrison, “The Sound and the Fury” by William Faulkner, “The Talented Mr. Ripley” by Patricia Highsmith.
Sure, I own the books now. But am I reading them?
Partially! My challenge can be illustrated by an even earlier weekend when I began with the best of intentions to read Faulkner — but ended up tearing through Ramin Setoodeh’s gossipy “Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of “The View.”
I mean, you can read the work of a Nobel Prize winner in literature, or you can read about how Barbara Walters battled Rosie O’Donnell.
That’s the joy and terror of reading, when separated from work. So many books tower on all sides of us, important, silly, smart, ludicrous and just plain incomprehensible. Picking one means ignoring all those others, at least for the time being. We only enjoy so much time, and only so much of that time can be spent tracing our eyes through the letters and sentences and paragraphs that adorn a page.
We can never read all the books, despite our hopes to the contrary. So we pick up one volume after another, reading into the future.
Or we consume another think piece about Bari Weiss and “60 Minutes.”

Officials warn: ""Get out of the way."" Evacuations are underway.","In summary
Atmospheric river threatens to unleash deadly debris flows through LA’s wildfire scars. Officials warn: “Get out of the way.” Evacuations are underway.


This story originally published Nov. 14 has been updated after Governor Gavin Newsom announced the state would mobilize resources in advance of winter storms. A dangerous atmospheric river is poised to deliver “excessive rainfall” across Southern California, raising fears that the rain could unleash a threat that has been lingering in the burn scars of wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles communities in recent years.
Called debris flows, these fast-moving slurries of floodwater and sediment can hurtle down slopes carrying cars, trees and even boulders with them.
They’re like “a flood on steroids,” said Jason Kean, a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey’s landslide hazards program. “It’s really hard to stop these things. The best thing to do is get out of the way.” 
Northern California is already reeling from the atmospheric river that unleashed catastrophic flash flooding in Redding over the weekend, killing a 74-year-old man who became trapped in his pickup truck on a flooded roadway. 
Now, another storm is expected to reach coastal Northern California this evening, with strong winds and especially heavy rainfall expected to push into southern California by Wednesday. 
Forecasters warn that the rain “will cause life-threatening flash flooding, along with landslides, rockfalls, and/or mudslides,” particularly for areas along Southern California’s Transverse Ranges, including the San Bernardino, San Gabriel, and Sierra Madre mountains. “Urban flooding in the greater Los Angeles metro area is likely.” 
Burn scars — slicked by fire and stripped of plants — are especially dangerous during heavy rains. A storm after the Thomas Fire in 2018 spurred debris flows in Montecito that killed 23 people. And in February, a debris flow in the Palisades Fire burn zone swept a Los Angeles Fire Department member and his SUV into the Pacific Ocean. 
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works warns that there’s a risk of moderate debris and mudflows capable of blocking roadways and endangering some structures in the burn scars of more than a dozen fires — including January’s Eaton, Hurst and Palisades fires. 
The county has issued evacuation warnings in and around recent burn scars, and urged those who may take longer to evacuate to consider leaving now. Officials also announced some targeted evacuation orders for specific properties “at higher risk for mud and debris flows impacts.”
“Recent burn areas, including those impacted by the January wildfires, remain highly susceptible to mud and debris flows,” county officials warned Monday. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that more than 225 personnel and resources including 45 fire engines, 10 swiftwater rescue teams, helicopters and more have been pre-deployed to a dozen northern and southern California counties. 
Meteorologists are discussing it as a “one in every five years type of storm,” said Lisa Phillips with the National Weather Service. “There’s going to be problems everywhere. We have a lot of canyon roads and mountain roads, and things will fall down.” 
Phillips said she expects to see mudslides, landslides, sinkholes – even after the rains have ended, and urged people to stay off the roads if they can. 
“There’s going to be issues outside of the burn scars too, and flooding,” Phillips said. “We want everyone to stay at home, stay safe and don’t get yourself into any trouble unnecessarily.” 
We spoke with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kean, an expert on debris flows after wildfires, last month about what to expect when storms strike burn scars. This conversation has been edited and condensed.
As this storm really takes hold in LA and Southern California, I’m hearing a lot of concern about it hitting areas that burned this past year, including in the Eaton and Palisades fires. Why is this such a big concern? What could happen?
Last January those fires removed much of the vegetation on really steep slopes, and that made those slopes really vulnerable to erosion during intense rainfall. That protective blanket of vegetation is gone, and heavy rain can rapidly make a flash flood. And that flood, in some cases, can pick up material and turn into what we call a debris flow — which is like a flood on steroids.

These burn areas are still vulnerable, even though it’s now many months after the fire and there have been flows already. There’s still plenty of material that could be mobilized. So the threat’s still there. And so we know they’re bad actors, and we’re concerned they could be bad actors again. 
I’m hearing a lot of different terms: mudslide, debris flows, landslide. What are the differences, and which ones are the burn scars at risk for? 
Landslide is an umbrella term that captures all kinds of mass movements, from rock falls to debris flows — these floods on steroids — to big, slow movers. The type of flow that we’re most concerned about in a recent burn area is a debris flow. It’s also called a mudslide. But geologists don’t like to use the word mudslide as much because it sounds like there’s some mud on your driveway — not a big issue, not something that could kill you. And these things, if you’re in the wrong spot at the wrong time, they can cause serious damage.
You called it a flood on steroids. What happens in a debris flow? 
Flash floods are bad, and they can cause lots of problems, too. They can get even worse if they pick up enough sediment to turn into the consistency of wet concrete. But it’s worse than just concrete, because it can contain boulders the size of cars. And, very close to the mountain front, it can move very quickly — faster than you can run. And when it gets all bulked up with debris, the rocks, the gravel, the mud, trees, the flow can be a lot bigger. It just turns into a different animal. 
Now, debris flows pack a bigger punch than floods, but thankfully, they don’t have as long of reach. So usually, the debris flows are confined really close to the mountain fronts. That’s where they put those debris basins to catch them. But if there isn’t one protection like that, then they can travel downslope and impact neighborhoods, and then flooding can extend even further down. 
Is there something about Southern California that makes it higher risk?
Southern California’s kind of the world capital for these kinds of events. It’s got this combination of very steep topography, like the San Gabriel Mountains that just shoot right up, Santa Monica mountains, Santa Ynez — very steep topography. It burns fairly frequently. And then there are a lot of people living very close to the mountain front, so that’s what puts the risk up. 
The thing about a burn area is it takes much less rainfall to cause a problem than it would in unburned conditions. So we’ve now made the slopes really vulnerable. They’re extra steep. There’s a lot of people there. That’s why the risk is so high. 
We’ve seen debris flows in Northern California burn areas as well. It’s not just a Southern California problem, and it’s not just a California problem. 
Is there anything that could have been done to reduce this risk? Anything that should be done now? 
Not long after the fires, in particular the Palisades Fire, (there were) a number of fairly widespread debris flows that disrupted the roads. There were also, in the Eaton fire, floods and debris flows there. Thankfully there’s a dense network of LA County debris basins, which are designed to catch the material before it enters neighborhoods, and those largely saved the day. 
Planners have planned ahead and put in these debris basins — these big, giant holes in the ground — designed to catch the material. That’s the best defense against these. They’re not everywhere, but there is a good network of protection. Other than that, it’s really hard to stop these things. 
What should people who live near the recent burn scars know? What should they do now, as the rain starts? 
The best thing you could do is, if you’re really close to a drainage in one of these burn areas, is to get out of the way. You’re going to get a heads up from the National Weather Service, who’s closely monitoring the rainstorms. They know how much rain it’s going to take to cause a problem, and they’ll get out warnings, and local authorities will reach out to get people out of the way. So there’s a lot of eyes on the situation. And so at this point, the best thing to do is listen to the weather service, listen to local authorities. 
If they ask you to get out of the way, take their advice. These things can happen really fast if there is an intense burst of rain, a flash flood, where debris flow can start within minutes. 
So there is no escaping a debris flow once it starts? 
It’s pretty difficult. If you have a two-story home and you happen to be there at the wrong time, get up to that second floor for sure. Fight like heck if you get trapped in one. But best to be out of the way.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021425-EatonFireMudslides-JAJ-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 02:56:39.944165

San Marcos residents celebrated the holiday tradition of posadas together while navigating fear and tension caused by increased ICE enforcement.


On Friday night, organizers of a community holiday festival in San Marcos were busy planning a neighborhood procession and readying trays of tamales for guests.
At the same time, they were preparing security to watch for ICE activity in the largely low-income, Latino area of North County San Diego.
“We rely on the community,” said San Marcos Councilmember Maria Nuñez, who represents San Marcos’ District 1, where 55% of the voting age population is Hispanic. “People are on high alert. If they see anything, hear anything, if ICE is in the area, they’ll let us know.”
Universidad Popular, a civic organization in North County San Diego, sponsored the event, called the Posada Comunitaria, with a local church, Restoration Abbey. It’s the third time they’ve held the event in San Marcos, but this year the festivities took place against a backdrop of apprehension as immigration enforcement has ramped up under the Trump administration.
The procession, or posada, traditionally reenacts the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem before the birth of Christ. In San Marcos, residents and organizers filed through the neighborhood, where affordable housing complexes are home to many immigrant families.
The event places the advent story in a modern context, said Alex Aguas, a priest with Restoration Abbey, which assists asylum seekers.
“The practice of the Posada really invites people to think about ‘what does it mean to be rejected?’” he said. “Or ‘what does it mean to be on the margins and looking for sanctuary and shelter at this time?’ We also just get to have the opportunity to celebrate.”
As guests arrived and sipped cups of coffee and apple cider, security volunteers in hot pink vests huddled to discuss how to manage traffic control and watch for immigration agents.

“All of our teams, all of our pink vests here, have been trained in immigration response,” said Arcela Nuñez, co-director of Universidad Popular, and Maria Nuñez’ sister.  “We have people watching all points in this neighborhood.”
San Marcos, a city of 94,000 in North County San Diego, appears to account for just a few of the immigration arrests in the San Diego area. But government data suggests the numbers have ticked up this year, and organizers said they have seen more immigration activity recently.
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has arrested at least 38 people in San Marcos since September 2023, with 20 of those arrests between June and October of this year, according to federal data provided by ICE in response to a FOIA request, processed by the Deportation Data Project, and analyzed by CalMatters. CalMatters contacted ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to confirm the numbers, and has not heard back. 
The escalating enforcement, and a change in policy that permits immigration enforcement at areas such as churches and schools that were previously off limits, has created a chilling effect on some community activities. Arcela Nuñez said her organization debated whether to hold the event this year in light of those concerns. They decided to go ahead, but to proceed with caution.

Organizers were particularly attuned to possible reports of ICE activity at the San Marcos Home Depot, less than a mile away, where other immigration raids have taken place this year. Home Depot stores where immigrant day laborers gather to seek work, have been a target for enforcement in Pomona, Los Angeles and Sacramento this year. 
In October U.S. Customs and Border Patrol arrested 22 people with criminal records at Home Depot locations in San Marcos and Encinitas, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Jason Givens said.
“If anything happens, look for experienced security,” Flower Alvarez-Lopez, co-director of Universidad Popular, told about two dozen volunteers gathered in a circle. “We will be able to help you.”
Volunteers distributed candles to participants, who lined up to march through the courtyard of a neighboring apartment building.  Musicians strummed guitars as several hundred singers serenaded residents with songs such as “Noche de Paz” and “Letania para pedir posada,” which translates to a litany requesting lodging.
Their next stop was El Palenque Taco Shop around the corner on San Marcos Boulevard. Organizers waved flashlights to direct the marchers, and steered cars around the crowd in the parking lot, before leading the group a few doors down to La Michoacana Ice Cream.
Carolers made one more stop at an apartment complex before returning to the church, where families lined up for plates heaped with rice and beans, tamales, pizza slices and conchas, a Mexican sweet bread.
The San Marcos event  proceeded without incident, but illustrates the tension that community leaders face trying to plan cultural celebrations while maintaining vigilance about potential immigration operations.
Ines Delgado, an immigration advocate with the North County LGBTQ Resource Center in neighboring Oceanside, volunteered at the posada, after hosting a celebration for International Migrants Day a day earlier, on Thursday evening. On Friday morning she said some clients showed up for a food distribution at the center, but confided that they had been too nervous to attend festivities the night before. 
“Many said they were afraid to come out,” she said. “It might be the focus on immigration, but also being out at night.”

At the Universidad Popular offices in San Marcos, a sign on the door states “Notice: private property and establishment,” warning immigration agents or other law enforcement officers that a judicial warrant is required to enter non-public areas.
Inside, pink signs embellished with flowers remind clients of their rights to remain silent in the case of arrest, and to ask officers if they are being detained.
“A lot of our community partners are doing signage like this,” Arcela Nuñez said. “So if ICE were to show up, we don’t want them to come in and we want people to feel safe.”
Behind their office, the group wrapped up the night with a pair of industrial-strength, star-shaped pinatas. Dozens of children labored to smack them open and then scrambled to collect the candy after they burst. 
Although the organization and church host the posada and other community festivals annually, this year’s neighborhood pilgrimage particularly highlighted the plight of “strangers seeking welcome,” Aguas said. 
“Based on the changing political climate, that work takes on different meaning and resonance.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s largest public employees union filed a series of unfair labor practice complaints Tuesday, claiming state administrators have violated rules on employee surveillance at work and unilaterally changed agreed-upon policies on telework eligibility and shift differentials.
The complaints by members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Council 3 came as part of a broader appeal to Gov. Wes Moore (D) and state lawmakers for better pay and working conditions at a time when the state, and state agencies, are under stress.
“We’re at a critical time in Maryland when we have an administration in Washington that has made it their mission to go after the public services millions rely on,” said Council 3 President Patrick Moran. backed by more than two dozen state workers at a Baltimore news conference.
“We need a state government and state leadership that are standing up to those threats and charting a different course. Standing with public employees means not committing unfair labor practices,” he said.
A spokesperson for the governor said Tuesday afternoon that the Moore administration has continued to support public servants while also managing a “historic budget crisis as Maryland continues to face unprecedented attacks from the federal administration.”
“From day one, Gov. Moore has consistently stood up for Maryland’s workers, making clear that supporting labor and protecting our workforce are central to this administration’s work,” said Rhyan Lake, the spokesperson.

“Each year, he has reaffirmed that commitment to public servants and organized labor, despite ongoing budget constraints, the state and the union have reached agreements to continue annual increases. The governor will continue to work with our labor partners to ensure our workers are protected,” Lake said.
But in separate filings with the state’s Public Employee Labor Relations Board filed Tuesday, the union said the administration has fallen short in several areas.
The first complaint claims the Department of Budget and Management violated shift differential language in the the union’s current collective bargaining agreement, which runs through Dec. 31, 2026. The union said that agreement requires the state to pay an additional $1 an hour to any union member who works an overnight shift, but that the department last week that it had developed a list of job classifications that would qualify for the differential.
“The announcement reveals DBM’s intention to – contrary to the agreement – selectively award shift differential pay to only certain classifications and employees in its discretion,” read the complaint.
The second complaint, also filed against DBM, claims the department is refusing to provide a list of union members wh0 are eligible for telework — as it has in the past — or track those who are taking it, making it impossible for the union to continue to negotiate the issue. The agency also said telework “agreements are a management right,” according to the complaint and the existing telework agreement”only requires OPSB [the Office of Personnel Services and Benefits] meet and discuss telework designations” with the union.
Finally, the union complained that the collective bargaining agreement makes clear that video surveillance in the workplace may be used “solely for security purposes,” but that the Maryland Department of Health is using it to track “employees in the moment-to-moment performance of their duties.”
The complaint cites cases where nurses and other workers at the Thomas B. Finan Center in Cumberland were monitored as they prepared and delivered medications, to see how long they washed their hands or if they were using personal protective equipment. In one case, a supervisor texted workers to shift their positions in a room so the camera could better see their performance.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Such monitoring also “pervades” at Springfield Hospital Center in Eldersburg, Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center in Jessup, Eastern Shore Hospital Center in Cambridge, the RICA-Baltimore in the city and Spring Grove Hospital Center in Catonsville, the complaint said.
All three complaints were filed with the state’s Public Employees Relations Board. Union members said these types of filings are “very rare.”
The charges come at a time when “state services are in crisis,” according to union members, who pointed to a lack of beds at local hospitals, assaults on staff at correctional facilities and staffing shortages that affect the overall quality of work.
Moran said average turnover in state government reached 409 employees per month in August. And the state’s “voluntary separation program” announced this summer exacerbated staffing and public service challenges.
Union members have expressed concerns about working conditions at least since last year, after Legionella bacteria were discovered in the water at State Center. Earlier this year, AFSCME and other labor unions, along with family and friends of slain Parole Officer Davis Martinez pushed for stronger worker protections, which were enacted in May in the Davis Martinez Public Employee Safety and Health Act.
On Tuesday, union members called on state officials to work with the union to assess cost-saving measures that will not only hire and retain workers, but also keep them and the public safe.
“We are ready, and we have been ready, to partner with the state on how to cut costs in a real, sustainable way that doesn’t harm state employees, state services and Maryland’s working families,” said Cherrish Vick, a family services case worker for 17 years and AFSCME Maryland’s secretary treasurer. “We cannot do our work if our government does not have our back, and that looks like acting as a partner, working with us on cost savings and paying state workers what we deserve.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Patrick-Moran-with-AFSCME-Council-3-12-23-2025-1024x665.jpg,,,2025-12-24 00:11:56.984869

Yet federal research funding bears almost no relationship to that burden.,"A disease that may cost the United States as much as $362 billion a year in medical expenses and lost productivity receives about $13 million in annual research funding from the National Institutes of Health. I am one of the millions of Americans living in that gap.
Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, is a complex disease that attacks multiple systems in the body. Because of the overlap with Long Covid —studies estimate that about half of Long COVID patients meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS— researchers now believe as many as 9 million Americans may now be living with it. Roughly a quarter are housebound or bedbound.

Elizabeth Ansell

For patients, daily life is ruled by a cruel equation: spend too much energy, pay later. A shower, a phone call, or walking to the mailbox can trigger what’s known as a “crash” —a delayed collapse of symptoms that can last for days, weeks, or months. In those stretches, people can become unable to sit upright, tolerate light or sound, or even speak more than a few words at a time. There is no diagnostic test, no FDA-approved treatment, and far too few clinicians who know how to recognize or manage the disease.
The economic consequences are enormous. Many people with ME/CFS can no longer work at all; others can work only a few hours a week. Researchers estimate that lost productivity alone costs the U.S. tens of billions of dollars each year, on top of billions more in medical spending. For individuals, the average combined hit from lost income and out-of-pocket costs has been estimated at $20,000 to $23,000 per year. Families often lose a second income when a spouse or parent becomes a full-time caregiver.
Yet federal research funding bears almost no relationship to that burden. NIH spends roughly $13 million a year on ME/CFS —far less than it devotes to other serious chronic illnesses with comparable or lower estimated costs, such as HIV/AIDS and breast cancer. Experts have suggested that ME/CFS funding would need to rise roughly fortyfold to match the disease’s impact.
In 2024, NIH approved the first-ever ME/CFS Research Roadmap, a plan developed with scientists, clinicians, and people living with the disease. It lays out a clear sequence: first, give doctors reliable tools to diagnose ME/CFS early and consistently, especially its hallmark delayed crash after exertion. Second, build the core infrastructure modern research depends on —a national patient registry, shared biobanks, and a data hub so researchers can compare results and identify subgroups. Third, create a trial network built around the realities of this disease, with home-based or low-burden participation and the ability to test promising therapies in small, careful studies and then quickly scale up what works.
This isn’t an open-ended wish list. It’s a practical blueprint for unlocking treatments in a disease that has been ignored for decades, and for building tools that can also serve Long COVID and other infection-related conditions. But a roadmap without fuel goes nowhere. The plan does not yet have dedicated funding, specific timelines, or clear benchmarks for success.
Congress has started to stir. A recent Senate spending report recognized the urgency of ME/CFS, praised NIH for approving the roadmap, and asked the agency to explain how it will carry it out. That is better than silence. But patients have learned that report language and memos do not, by themselves, build registries, run trials, or bring new therapies into clinics.
I know the cost of delay in my own life. Ten years ago, I was an active professional, building a career and a future. ME/CFS stripped away my job, my independence, and many of the small rituals that make a life feel like it’s mine. At my worst, I would lay in a dark room unable to speak or move, saving up what little energy I had for four days just so I could whisper “help.”
Even now, talking too long on the phone, brushing my hair, or transferring to a wheelchair can trigger a crash that sets me back for days or weeks. My family has become my care team. My friends have become advocates. Their dedication keeps me afloat, but it cannot substitute for a functioning research system.
Congress can change this. Lawmakers should direct NIH to dedicate a multi-year funding stream to the ME/CFS Roadmap, require clear milestones and annual progress reports, and ensure that the new research infrastructure also serves Long Covid and related conditions.
This is not only a moral question. It is a fiscal one. Every year that ME/CFS remains under- researched, more people fall out of the workforce, more families burn through savings, and more costs quietly accrue to disability programs and health systems. For a fraction of what the disease already costs the country, we could build the scientific foundation needed to prevent some of that loss.
Millions of Americans are waiting. I am one of them. We do not need another decade of hearings or essays documenting neglect. We need Congress to give NIH a funded, accountable mandate to follow the map it has already drawn—and to judge success by whether fewer people are forced out of work and out of their lives.
NIH has the roadmap. It’s up to Congress to decide whether it leads anywhere.

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Specia to the SC Daily Gazette)Three Republican candidates sailed to victory in special elections two days before Christmas, winning two seats in the South Carolina state House and one in the Senate.
In the only contested race, Midlands pastor John Lastinger won 62% of the vote; he will now represent the House district formerly held by the former leader of the ultra-right Freedom Caucus, RJ May. 
May resigned in August after a federal grand jury indicted him on child sexual material charges. He has since pleaded guilty to five counts for distributing videos of children being sexually abused.
A judge is scheduled to sentence May on Jan. 14, 2026. He faces up to 20 years in prison.
Lastinger’s opponent for the state House seat spanning the area between Cayce, Red Bank and Gaston, Democrat and retired Army colonel J. Chuck Hightower, took just 38% of the 2,683 total votes cast in the low-turnout election Tuesday, according to unofficial results from the South Carolina Election Commission. 
Lastinger could not be reached for comment.
In the last general election for that seat, May, the only candidate on the ballot, won 92% of 14,124 votes cast. Republicans have held the ruby-red district since former state Rep. Lenoir Sturkie took office in February 1984. 
Ahead of the Tuesday elections, state Democratic Party Chair Christale Spain in an email blast called the contests a chance for Democrats to “show real power,” but the callout to voters made little difference.
The other two elections had only one candidate on the ballot. 
Firebrand Republican Lee Bright will return to a Senate district that spans parts of Greenville and Spartanburg counties. He held the seat for two previous terms before losing a primary runoff in 2016. He handily beat a write-in candidate supported by state Democratic Party leaders, earning 67% percent of 5,249 votes.
Dianne Mitchell, a former teacher with the backing of the state’s House Freedom Caucus, easily won her district in Greenville county with 70% percent of 2,124 votes against a write-in candidate. 
Lastinger and Mitchell will take office in time for the start of the Legislative Session in January and serve until the seats are up for re-election in November. 
Bright will finish out the second half of his predecessors’ term in the Senate. The seat will be on the ballot again in 2028. 
One more special election, for a state House district representing Dorchester County, will pit two Air Force veterans against each other: Republican Greg Ford and Democrat Sonja Ogletree-Satani. 
A week after that race, the 2026 session is set to open with all 170 Statehouse seats filled.

(Getty Images)The new $900 billion military spending law signed by President Donald Trump last week includes special benefits for soldiers and Coast Guardsmen in Alaska, hundreds of millions in new construction within the state, and a continued push to reactivate the U.S. Navy base at Adak.
“It’s safe to say that this is the biggest bill that Congress does every year,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, in an interview this week.
The National Defense Authorization Act, as it is formally known, is normally a must-pass piece of legislation for members of Congress, and despite deadlocks on other key issues, it sailed through the U.S. House on a 312-112 bipartisan vote and through the Senate on a 77-20 vote.
Before final passage, the bill picked up plenty of additions, including the annual Coast Guard funding measure. 
“It’s a train leaving the station, and a lot of people want to jump on,” Sullivan said.
The bill raises military base pay by 3.8% nationwide, but soldiers and active-duty members of the Coast Guard in Alaska will receive a special bonus: A round-trip flight home each year.
“That’s not going to change the world. That’s not going to change the balance of power between the Russians and Chinese and America. But these are the kind of things that you can get in this bill that matter if you care and take it seriously,” Sullivan said.
Murkowski said the flight program was inspired by surveys conducted after a wave of deaths by suicide at Alaska military bases.
“We asked some of the enlisted: ‘What would make a difference to you?’ And we heard really simple things like, ‘I would love to be able to fly back home as a single enlisted just once a year, to go see my mom, be there for Christmas, be there for my nephew’s birthday,’” she said.
In a written statement, Begich said the pay increase provisions, “as well as the Commander-in-Chief’s announced year-end military pay bonus” demonstrate “sustained investment and support for our men and women in uniform.”
Sitting in her office in Anchorage and looking out at the snow-covered mountains, Murkowski noted that the bill contains millions for additional cold-weather gear and vehicles for soldiers deployed in Alaska. 
For years, Sullivan has pushed the Department of Defense to reactivate the U.S. Navy’s base at Adak, which formally closed in 1997. The land has since been transferred to the Aleut Corporation.
In July, Sullivan briefly blocked a confirmation vote for the U.S. Navy’s top officer. That got him a meeting with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who committed to creating a task force that would look at reopening Adak, Sullivan said.
“This task force was set up. They were actually supposed to have their recommendations to the Secretary of War mid-December. That deadline slipped, and trust me, I am conducting — I would call it vigorous oversight of this issue,” Sullivan said, using the title proposed by the Trump administration that would replace “secretary of defense,” which has not yet been approved by Congress.
Earlier this year, the Republican-backed Big Beautiful Bill Act included $115 million for “exploration and development of existing Arctic infrastructure.”
The new military spending law requires reports every 90 days on how that money is being spent and “an assessment of the feasibility of any viable infrastructure options in the Arctic region.”
That’s targeted language for Adak, Sullivan said.
“I hope we are getting Adak reopened,” he said. “That is going to be hugely strategic.”
Murkowski has a different vision.
“I think Sen. Sullivan has made it very, very clear from the hearings where he’s brought military leadership in, that Adak is what he’s focusing on. But you also have other other infrastructure in what is defined as the Alaska Arctic. You’ve got Eareckson out there in Shemya. You’ve got Nome, where we’re trying to build out a port. So it’s a little bit nuanced,” she said.
The law also instructs the military’s industrial office to boost Alaska mining and energy projects to the extent possible. Its text says the office should prioritize “the clearance of mining and energy project applications … likely to experience significant temporal impact due to seasonal Arctic climate conditions.”
That office has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on mines and factories in the United States and Canada.
Statistics provided by Sullivan’s office show $284 million in construction at Fort Wainwright, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson and Eielson Air Force Base combined. There’s also millions for new missile defense construction at Fort Greely and elsewhere, and the bill includes instructions to develop a Coast Guard base on St. Paul Island to cover the Bering Sea.
The Coast Guard will also have to analyze the risks of increased shipping traffic through the Bering Strait and come up with a plan to address those risks.
Between the Big Beautiful Bill Act, the law to reopen the government after the extended shutdown and now the military spending law, “Alaska is getting well north of $1 billion in military and Coast Guard infrastructure,” Sullivan said. “I’m not sure we’ve ever done that.”
That matters because military construction means work for Alaskans in the construction industry and Alaskans who sell things to support construction.
“North of a billion — that’s really good for national security for America, but that’s also going to be really good for jobs,” Sullivan said. “That is a big stimulus to our economy.”

Bob Ferguson made a splash Tuesday with his full-throated endorsement of taxing the earnings of millionaires.
The surprise declaration from the first-term Democratic governor nearly drowned out his newly released plan to erase a multibillion-dollar shortfall in the current state budget.
He made “super clear” that if Washington taxes millionaires, the money won’t start flowing into state coffers until 2029 at the earliest. In the meantime, he said, the state must deal with the immediate problem of the $2.3 billion budget hole.
Ferguson proposes to patch it by trimming $800 million in spending, withdrawing $1 billion from the state’s rainy day fund, and making an unprecedented use of nearly $600 million in revenues from the state’s auctions of air pollution allowances.
The proposal also contains $1.2 billion of increased spending to cover costs of inflation in existing programs, greater demand for public services and complying with new federal requirements under Republicans’ so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.”
The budget plan is balanced through June 30, 2027 and does not raise taxes, keeping a pledge Ferguson made earlier this month. The plan does eliminate tax breaks related to data centers and prescription drug wholesalers.
“We are facing falling revenue, rising costs, and budget cuts and chaos coming from the Trump administration,” he said. “I’m providing a road map for the Legislature. This is, of course, the first step in a conversation about how best to balance our budget.”
Nitty gritty
The spending plan released Tuesday makes adjustments to the two-year budget Ferguson signed in May and that took effect July 1.
It is the third and final piece of the budget package Ferguson will send to lawmakers for their consideration in the 60-day session that begins Jan. 12.
Last week, he proposed pumping an additional $244 million into housing development programs through the capital budget, and $3 billion into preserving highways and bridges and building three new ferries through the transportation budget. Those sums would largely come from borrowing money through the bond market.
The current operating budget called for $77.8 billion in spending over two years across government. It relied on about $4 billion from new taxes and transfers from other accounts into the general fund, the central pot of money used to pay for most state spending. It projected the state would end the fiscal cycle with $225 million in cash reserves and $2 billion in its emergency, or rainy day, fund.

What Ferguson proposed Tuesday lifts total spending to nearly $79 billion while leaving the state with $140 million in cash reserves and $1 billion in emergency savings at the end of the budget cycle in mid-2027.
While Ferguson’s embrace of a millionaire’s tax will please progressives, his avoidance of new revenue streams to close the current gap will not, as some are pressing ahead with legislation to impose new and higher taxes on large corporations.
Overall, Ferguson’s plan does boost state spending. Of the total, $165 million is to deal with the effects of H.R. 1, the major federal legislation, which imposes new and stricter eligibility rules for food assistance and Medicaid programs.
For example, nearly $50 million will be spent to provide an estimated 30,000 refugees, asylees, and other immigrants with state-funded food assistance after they were cut from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
The single largest new sum in Ferguson’s plan confronts the state’s growing lawsuit payouts. The premiums state agencies pay into a liability account haven’t kept pace with these legal expenses. 
Without a permanent fix, the state Department of Enterprise Services, which oversees the self-insurance fund, has warned the gap could grow to more than $1.3 billion by mid-2027, and increase further from there.
Ferguson commits $955 million to resolving the problem, with a portion penciled in for use in the next budget. 
In other areas, the budget would invest $55 million to maintain subsidies for health care premiums for the Cascade Care program. It would also restore $2.9 million in funding for Capitol Campus Security and $8.5 million pared from the Abortion Access Project.
And Ferguson funds new contracts for 5,300 general government and higher education workers represented by the Washington Public Employees Association. These workers did not ratify a contract in time to be included in the budget approved this year. 
State government employees would get a 3% pay hike retroactive to July 1, 2025 and a 2% increase on July 1, 2026. Under their deal, community college employees working on July 1, 2026 would receive both increases.
Erasing the shortfall
One of the biggest — and controversial — maneuvers is Ferguson’s redirecting of $569 million of proceeds from carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act into the Working Families Tax Credit program, an idea first pushed by Senate Republicans last session.
The program provides credits ranging from $325 to $1,290 to low- to moderate-income families.  It has historically been funded out of the general fund. Ferguson said this one-time move would free up general fund dollars for other uses. 
This move is explicitly allowed under the 2021 law.
House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, an architect of the Climate Commitment Act, said the state needs to spend the money to make the state more resilient to climate damage.
“He had difficult choices in drafting this budget,” he said. “We have difficult choices ahead of us to pass a budget.”
Meanwhile, the governor’s budget slices spending throughout the state government.
For example, he calls for across-the-board cuts of 3% to the University of Washington and Washington State University, and 1.5% to the other regional universities and community and technical colleges.
He also halts a planned increase in per-pupil funding for school districts that struggle to raise money from local levies due to lower property values. And he proposes capping signups for the Working Connections child care program and removing 1,816 slots for the Transition to Kindergarten program starting in the 2026-27 school year.
The hits to education drew fire from Larry Delaney, president of the Washington Education Association, which is the state’s largest union for public school employees, and Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal.
“Schools and colleges are currently underfunded; our students have extensive unmet needs and additional cuts to the Local Assistance Program, Transition to Kindergarten, and more exacerbate the situation,” Delaney said.
Republican alternative
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, the lead Republican budget writer in the House, said he thought Ferguson’s proposal was a “prank.”
“Instead of fixing the problem, this budget relies on accounting tricks, raids dedicated accounts, shifts school construction money to paper over holes, and keeps using one-time cash to pay for permanent programs. Meanwhile, it cuts back child care help, delays care for seniors, shortchanges schools, caps support for working families, and ends tax breaks,” he said
Last week, Couture put out his own plan that he says will trim state spending by $3.7 billion over the next three years while protecting core services and avoiding cuts to public schools.
He said his “Affordability First” plan would restore funding for programs cut or underfunded in the current budget, including Medicaid services, hospitals, food assistance, wildfire prevention, medical care for drug-exposed newborns, and law enforcement hiring.
It would also reimpose voter-backed spending limits tied to inflation and population growth and require what’s known as zero-based budgeting for agencies. To save money, it would end free health care for immigrants in the country without legal status, trim management payrolls in community colleges and universities and require public employees to pay a greater share of their benefits.
The budget problem is a result of the state spending more than it collects, Couture said. Democrats’ passage of $12 billion of new and higher taxes last session between the operating and transportation budgets “didn’t solve it, so we’re right back where we were,” he said.

William Lindstedt will move to the state Senate to take the seat formerly occupied by Colorado state Sen. Faith Winter, who died in a car crash in November. 
Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat, won a vote during a vacancy committee election Tuesday. The committee comprised Democratic voters from Senate District 25. Lindstedt beat one other candidate, Tom Klenow. Senate District 25 covers north Westminster, part of Broomfield, and Northglenn. 
“These are not the circumstances I anticipated pursuing a seat in the state Senate, and I know this loss has been devastating for our community, and for many of us very personally,” Lindstedt said about Winter’s death. “At the same time, with the legislative session rapidly approaching, the work of serving our community in the state Senate has to continue.”

Lindstedt filed paperwork with the secretary of state’s office in June declaring his intent to run for the Senate District 25 seat in 2026. Klenow also filed paperwork declaring his intent to run for the seat in 2026. 
In the House this year, Lindstedt chaired the House Finance Committee and the Legislative Audit Committee. He said he has worked on “some of the toughest fiscal and oversight decisions facing our state” on those committees. He served as a member of Broomfield City Council before he was elected to the Legislature. 
Lindstedt said he would work to prioritize protecting public benefits like Medicaid and Colorado’s paid family leave, clean air and water, and funding for K-12 education.
U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, a Lafayette Democrat, nominated Lindstedt in the vacancy committee meeting. 
“No one can fill Faith’s incredibly large shoes, but I am convinced that William Lindstedt will be an incredible, incredible public servant for the people of Colorado Senate District 25,” Neguse said. 
Lindstedt is subject to a state ethics complaint alleging he and other moderate Democrats in the Colorado Legislature accepted payment for luxury resort expenses at an October gathering with lobbyists in Vail. 
Winter, a Broomfield Democrat, died during a multi-vehicle car crash on Interstate 25 south of Denver on Nov. 26. Winter was the only one in her car, and her blood alcohol level was above the legal limit when she died. 
Another vacancy committee will need to convene to select a replacement for Lindstedt in House District 33, which is centered in Broomfield. 
The Legislature will convene for its 2026 session on Jan. 14.

(Photo courtesy Lanny Hartmann)Maryland is delaying a new inspection fee for electric vehicle chargers that was set to take effect next week, amid concerns that the payments could slow chargers’ rollout in the state.
The Maryland Department of Agriculture, which is planning to inspect public chargers for functionality and accuracy, announced Tuesday that it won’t require charger owners to pay the fee of $150 per port until July 1 — as opposed to Jan. 1 was originally planned.
Electric vehicle advocates have argued that the fee could compel Maryland businesses to install fewer chargers — or even rip out existing chargers to avoid incurring the fees. They worry in particular about chargers installed at housing complexes around the state, which are mainly intended for residents’ use and often do not generate anywhere near the same profit as a fast charger installed along a busy highway corridor.
The Agriculture Department has argued that because the chargers are public, and charge consumers a fee, they ought to be regulated just like any others. And the state says the fee is set at $150 per port because testing EV chargers comes at a fairly high cost: Inspectors plan to use an expensive piece of equipment called a “standard,” and they have to pay for the power they consume during testing.
Maryland’s EV charger inspection program rolls on, despite consumer, industry pushback

But the department issued a number of clarifications in its news release Tuesday, adding that multi-unit dwellings can receive exemptions if they meet a number of conditions. Equipment, for example, must be exclusively designated for residents of the complex, and cannot be accessible to members of the public. It must have signage stating as such, and it cannot be advertised on public websites as an available charging location.
Chargers located at workplaces can also be exempt if they are designated only for employees and located in areas restricted to employees. Chargers at private residences and free chargers are automatically exempt.
“The decision to extend the registration deadline to July 1, 2026, will allow the department to facilitate more extensive and meaningful dialogue with the electric vehicle charging industry, local governments, and the community at large,” Maryland Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks said in a news release.
“This extended timeline will allow us to incorporate critical feedback and make the necessary formal amendments to the program’s structure and regulations, ensuring the program is effective, fair, and supportive of the state’s electric vehicle adoption goals while meeting the practical needs of all stakeholders,” his statement said.
Some in the EV charging industry, though, remain concerned that the new fee will be prohibitive, and stymie the state’s effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through greater use of electric vehicles.
Robert Borkowski, owner of Plug IO, an EV-charging company focused on installations at housing and condo complexes, said he recently received an exemption for chargers he is installing in Frederick. But he’s concerned that many multi-unit dwellings won’t be able to meet the requirements to become exempt. It may be difficult for the complexes to prevent members of the public from using their chargers, for example.
“The requirements are extremely restrictive,” Borkowski said in an email.
Borkowski also argued that complexes should be allowed to list chargers on their websites.
“How else would potential residents learn about the property’s EV charging infrastructure?” Borkowski said. “Why penalize MUDs [multi-unit dwellings] for promoting their forward-thinking properties and supporting Maryland’s goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?”

The imperiled bird has been “screwed over” in the last decade, critics say, but Wyoming’s grouse leader says conservation remains intact despite feds' changes.
The post Greater sage grouse advocates blast new federal plan endorsed by Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Conservationists blasted a federal rewrite of a sage grouse protection plan endorsed by Wyoming, saying it strips safeguards from Wyoming’s fabled Golden Triangle, site of the world’s largest breeding ground for the imperiled bird.
The Bureau of Land Management on Monday released its rewrite of plans governing the use and development of about 50 million acres of public land in eight Western states, including 26.6 million acres in Wyoming. The framework for Equality State management spans 66 pages, not counting maps and appendices, and applies to an area larger than Kentucky.
Conservationists criticized the rewrite as “reckless” and “a holiday gift to private industry,” while promising to sue the Trump administration.
“We’re not letting these dancing birds go without a fight, so we’ll see Trump in court.” Randi Spivak
“Every president starting with Obama has screwed over these iconic Western birds,” Randi Spivak, public lands policy director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “We’ll keep fighting until these beautiful dancing birds and the places they live get the protection they deserve.”
The new plan for Wyoming reflects updated scientific information, changing land uses and local habitat, Wyoming’s acting BLM director Kristina Kirby wrote in the document’s introduction. The regulations meet the BLM’s multiple-use mandate, conserve grouse, avoid endangered-species listing and minimize regulatory burdens, she wrote.
Bob Budd, chairman of Wyoming’s Sage Grouse Implementation Team, said he feels good about the federal plan and Wyoming’s own gubernatorial sage grouse core-area order. “Protections are still there,” Budd said. “The commitment to manage [for conservation] is as strong as it’s ever been.”
In revising the plans, the BLM deferred to states, including Wyoming, which started addressing grouse conservation decades ago. “The BLM accepted the State of Wyoming’s recommendation to use their existing adaptive management approach,” she wrote.
The state with the most
Wyoming possesses the highest concentrations of greater sage grouse in the world. It is home to almost 40% of the bird’s population. Because of long-term declines — down nearly 80% between 1968 and 2023, according to the Center for Biological Diversity — the grouse were eligible for federal protection under the Endangered Species Act in the early 2010s.
To save the species, the government employed BLM management plans instead of a more sweeping ESA listing. But, “many protective measures from the 2015 plans were never implemented and the plans were again revised and further weakened in 2018 and in 2024,” the Center for Biological Diversity said in a statement.

Conservation groups say safeguards are now further undermined. “Endangered Species Act protection for the bird will probably be necessary,” Eric Molvar, executive director of Western Watersheds Project, said in a statement.
The groups say reductions in required “hiding cover” — standards that require seven inches of grass in nesting areas — is one shortcoming.
“Science-based grass-height standards for grazing management have been eliminated, potentially allowing livestock to remove the tall grasses and shrubs that provide essential concealment during nesting season,” WildEarth Guardians’ Endangered Species Advocate Joanna Zhang said in a statement.
Under the new plan, the Golden Triangle would no longer be designated as an “area of critical environmental concern.” That swath of sagebrush sea northeast of Farson that’s about 40 miles on each side is home to the largest sage grouse breeding ground or lek in the world.
BLM protections in the previous management plan covering the Golden Triangle were one factor that led the agency last week to reject a nomination to develop a 2,194-acre parcel there. An oil and gas prospector sought rights to lease the plot that’s within two miles of the Divide Lek.
The plan also removes a development prohibition called “no surface occupancy” from key sage grouse habitat, critics say. That opens the landscape to potential “surface disturbance” — the bulldozing of sagebrush for roads, pipelines and drilling rigs.
“This will result in emptying public lands of sage grouse and other sensitive wildlife,” Molvar said.
“We’re not letting these dancing birds go without a fight,” Spivak added. “So we’ll see Trump in court.”
Core-area strategy remains
Gov. Mark Gordon said the plan acknowledges six decades of Wyoming conservation — leadership spanning three gubernatorial terms. “We will continue to invest in sage-grouse conservation alongside responsible development,” he said in a statement.
Budd further defined Wyoming’s protections and how they will conserve greater sage grouse. Regarding the 7-inch hiding cover, he said that’s not something that can be attained everywhere every year.
The 7-inch standard creates “a false narrative that can’t be met,” Budd said.
Instead, “what you manage for is healthy ecosystems,” he said. “That’s now what we have in the new version.”
The Golden Triangle remains protected as part of Wyoming’s core-area strategy, Budd said. Removing “no-surface occupancy” restrictions doesn’t mean drilling rigs will move in, he said. The new plan “still allows an NSO, if that’s the best way to protect grouse.”
He couldn’t say whether the new plan would prohibit leasing the recently rejected Golden Triangle parcel. Wyoming’s executive order and core area strategy would not allow a drilling rig “right on top” of the potential lease site, he said.
Directional drilling technology has advanced so it’s possible to access oil and gas from miles away, he said. Drilling remotely might be permitted with various seasonal restrictions, he suggested.
“We wanted to be strategic, surgical and correct things,” Budd said of the state’s involvement in the new rewrite. The adopted changes “addressed the reality that’s out there.”

Delbert Hosemann asked the state Board of Election Commissioners on Friday to file for a stay on a federal judge’s ruling that would lead to special elections for two seats on the Mississippi Supreme Court next year. 
Hosemann, a Republican, made the request in a letter to Gov. Tate Reeves, Attorney General Lynn Fitch and Secretary of State Michael Watson, fellow Republicans who comprise the election board. The request follows a Dec. 19 ruling by Mississippi Northern District federal Judge Sharion Aycock, which gave the Republican-controlled state Legislature until the end of its 2026 regular session to draw new Supreme Court district boundaries.
The ruling should be challenged, Hosemann said, because it could allow the federal court to redraw the boundaries to the court’s “liking,” an outcome that could favor candidates supported by Democrats. 
That’s what happened after a federal three-judge panel last year ordered lawmakers to redraw their districts in three areas of the state to give Black voters a fairer shot at electing candidates of their choice, Hosemann said. He said that was a mistake he doesn’t want repeated 
“Previously, this Board did not request a stay of a similar order to redistrict the Senate and the House districts, allowing the Senate and the House to effectively be redrawn by unconstitutional federal mandates on issues currently before the U.S. Supreme Court brought by other states,” Hosemann said in his letter. “But here we are again.”
Fitch’s office also appealed that ruling and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to sharply curtail the federal Voting Rights Act by declaring private voters cannot sue to prevent discrimination at the ballot box. 
If the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Mississippi’s favor, it would mean only the Department of Justice could sue to enforce the Voting Rights Act. 
With respect to the the ongoing legal battle over the state Supreme Court, the matter stems from a 2022 lawsuit filed by a group of Black voters and candidates. The group in 2022 sued state officials, alleging that Black candidates face unfair difficulties getting elected to the state’s high court.
 In a 105-page ruling in August, Aycock, a President George W. Bush appointee, found that the three Supreme Court districts were drawn in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. Aycock asked the Legislature to redraw those districts in the future to give Black voters a fair shot at electing candidates of their choice.   
The plaintiffs had requested special elections for seats held by Justice Kenny Griffis and Justice Jenifer Branning. Griffis’s term ends in Jan. 2030, while Branning’s runs through Jan. 2033.
Last year, Branning, a white candidate who described herself as a “constitutional conservative” and was backed by the Republican Party, defeated longtime Justice Jim Kitchens, a white man widely viewed as a candidate supported by Black voters. 
No Black person has ever been elected to the Mississippi Supreme Court without first obtaining an interim appointment from the governor, and no Black person from either of the two other districts has ever served on the state’s high court. 
Hosemann said the federal court ruling could have far-reaching consequences for several elected offices beyond the state Supreme Court. 
“Even ignoring the facts of the ballot box and the inherent constitutional right for the Legislature to draw districts, this case goes even further,” Hosemann said. “It refused to restrict any potential special elections to the two Mississippi Supreme Court districts at issue in favor of ordering the Legislature to redistrict and then the federal court will review the Legislature’s efforts.”
The federal court under this tack could also compel special elections for the Public Service and Mississippi Department of Transportation commissions, Hosemann said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30121809/Mississippi-Economic-Council-annual-Hobnob16A.jpg,,,2025-12-23 18:58:23.587422

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A Rusk County community that more than two years ago rejected the use of electronic voting machines has agreed to provide them so people with disabilities can vote in federal elections.
The agreement, signed in federal court in Madison earlier this month, ends a lingering legal dispute over voter access in the northern Wisconsin town of Thornapple that prompted a federal investigation.
The case underscores the importance of provisions in the federal Help America Vote Act, enacted in 2002, which includes voting rights guarantees for people with disabilities, according to Lisa Hasenstab, public policy manager for Disability Rights Wisconsin.
“Access to accessible voting is something that is not always a top priority in the mix of everything that has to happen for elections,” Hasenstab told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday. “But it is the law. It’s federal law. and state law as well, that accessible means of voting be provided at every polling place. If at even one polling place that option is not provided, that is a violation of voters’ rights.”
Hasenstab said a variety of voting machine systems include provisions tailored to people with disabilities who have difficulty marking paper ballots. Systems also include headphones for voters who can’t see, so they can  listen to the names of candidates on their ballots.
The Help America Vote Act requires every polling place to include such machines for people who need them, and any voter is able to use them, Hasenstab said.
Thornapple Town Chairman Tom Zelm declined to tell the Wisconsin Examiner in a phone conversation Tuesday why the town had stopped using voting machines and said he would have no comment on the settlement that the town and the U.S. Department of Justice signed in federal court on Dec. 12.
According to a May 13, 2024, report in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the  Thornapple town board voted in June 2023 to stop using electronic voting machines and use only paper ballots.
That same summer, Douglas Frank — profiled in the Los Angeles Times as a purveyor of “baseless claims about suspicious voting trends and secret algorithms used to steal elections” — visited the area, giving talks that stoked conspiracy theories about voting machines, according to several published reports.
After the April 2024 Wisconsin presidential preference primary, a local Democratic Party activist called another town board member to complain about the absence of voting machines that could be used by some people with disabilities. She recorded the call, in which the board member repeated false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump and blamed voting machines. The activist then posted the recording on YouTube.
DOJ lawyers wrote to the town’s chief election officer on May 7, 2024, referring to reports received by the department that the town board “may have voted to remove all electronic voting machines in all elections,” including presidential primary.
The DOJ letter stated that some voters with disabilities had reported their requests to use accessible voting machines in the primary election were not granted. It quoted the Help America Vote Act’s requirement for all polling places to include systems that enable voters with disabilities to cast their ballots.
The Lawrence Town Board in Brown County also passed a measure in 2023 to stop using voting machines. Lawrence reversed its decision Sept. 9, 2024, according to DOJ, and signed an agreement with the feds to comply with HAVA.
Thornapple did not reverse its voting machine ban, and DOJ sued the town. That October a federal judge issued an injunction, requiring the town to use accessible voting machines in the November 2024 election.
Separately, the Wisconsin Elections Commission ordered the town and its elections clerk to “take affirmative steps” and comply with Wisconsin’s law that also requires accessible electronic voting equipment at polling places to accommodate people with disabilities.
The town appealed the federal court injunction, losing before the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in July.
Under the Dec. 12 settlement, Thornapple and the town’s election officials “will ensure their voting systems are accessible to people with disabilities as required by HAVA.” The deal requires the town to use an electronic voting system “or other voting system equipped for individuals with disabilities at each polling place in the state, for each election for federal office.”
Town officials are also required to be trained on how to implement accessible voting systems that comply with HAVA, to keep the equipment in working order and provide all software and other updates. The deal also requires them to certify after every federal primary and general election that they have complied with the agreement.
Because the cases was originally pursued by the DOJ in the last year of President Joe Biden’s term, Hasenstab acknowledged that voting rights advocates watched the progress of the case with some concern after President Donald Trump took office and began reversing many Biden administration policies.
“We did have some nervousness that they wouldn’t pursue a final resolution to the case,” Hasenstab said Tuesday. “We’re pleasantly surprised that an agreement ended up being reached and that the Department of Justice stuck with that case.”

(Getty Images)A former nursing home owner pardoned by President Donald Trump asked a judge Tuesday for a delay before he has to report to an Arkansas prison to serve his state sentence, citing concerns that the state would be unable to meet his religious dietary needs.
Attorneys for Joseph Schwartz asked a judge for an extension to her order that he report to the Arkansas Department of Corrections by December 29. 
Schwartz, of New York, was three months into a three-year federal sentence for tax fraud when President Donald Trump pardoned him in November. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Karen Whatley last week ordered Schwartz to report to the Ouachita River Correctional Unit to serve out the remainder of his one-year sentence for his state conviction on Medicaid fraud and tax evasion charges.
Attorney General Tim Griffin earlier this month filed a petition seeking that Schwartz serve out the rest of his state sentence. 
Schwartz’s one-year Arkansas sentence was to run concurrently with his federal sentence, according to his plea deal with the state. Whatley had rejected Schwartz’s argument that the three months he served in federal prison made him immediately eligible for state parole.
In Tuesday’s filing, Schwartz’s attorneys said as a rabbi, he must adhere to a strict kosher diet. 
He’s restricted to a stricter form of kosher meat, not just from eating pork, according to the court filing.
“Schwartz does not believe the Arkansas Department of Corrections is sufficiently prepared to care for him and meet his religious and dietary needs while in custody,” Schwartz’s attorneys said in the filing.
Griffin’s office dismissed the motion as a delay tactic and said they would oppose the motion.
“Joseph Schwartz’s motion is a baseless attempt to delay completing his sentence,” spokesman Jeff LeMaster said in an email. “We have confirmed that the Department of Corrections has a kosher kitchen ready to meet Schwartz’s dietary needs.”
Schwartz pleaded guilty last year in federal court for his role in a $38 million tax fraud scheme involving nursing homes he owned across the country. He was pardoned by Trump in November.

Officials will also start using the map to assess fees on property owners in high-risk areas to help conduct assessments meant to minimize risk. 
Statewide, about 60,000 structures in Utah have been deemed “high risk” for wildfires. That’s according to a new online map the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands released last week. 
By plugging in their addresses to the tool called the Utah Wildfire Risk Explorer, Utahns can generate a report on how likely it is that their homes could be impacted by a wildfire. The site also suggests actions homeowners can take to better protect their property.

“Our goal is to empower homeowners, communities, fire departments, and municipalities to act in reducing their vulnerability to wildfire by giving them the necessary tools to identify and understand their wildfire risk,” the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands says on the website. 
State officials were required to build the tool after the 2025 Utah Legislature passed HB48, a law meant to increase wildfire risk awareness and encourage property owners to “share the responsibility of reducing that risk” in wildland urban interface areas, or areas where homes or other structures border or mingle with undeveloped wildlands. 
The Utah Legislature passed the law as wildfires in the West have increased in frequency and severity. Insurers have also raised premiums and created stricter eligibility requirements. 
Utah’s record-breaking fire year, in numbers

“Insurance availability and affordability are concerns for property owners in Utah, and many are already experiencing increased premiums or losing coverage as insurers respond to wildfire risk,” the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire & State Lands says on its website.
Under the law, which takes effect Jan. 1, property insurers are required to use the map to determine a property’s wildfire risk. 
“If an insurer raises rates by 20% or more, or drops coverage due to wildfire risk, it must provide notice and justification based on the facts underlying the decision, if requested by the property owner,” according to the division.
The new law also requires the state to assess property fees within the high-risk wildland urban interface boundary to help support risk assessments. Utahns will only be charged a fee if they own a taxable structure within the map’s High Risk Wildland Urban Interface boundary. 
Starting in 2026 and 2027, the fee will range from $20 to $100 per structure, based on square footage of taxable structures on the property, according to the division’s frequently asked questions page on HB48. 
If property owners take actions to reduce their wildfire risk, the fee may be reduced, the website says.

Some legislative Democrats are eyeing a 9.9% “millionaires tax” on adjusted annual gross income over $1 million. Ferguson endorsed this version of the proposal. Less than 0.5% of Washingtonians would be subject to the tax, and it’s expected to raise $3 billion per year. 
The revenue wouldn’t hit state coffers until 2029, Ferguson said. On Tuesday, the governor also released a spending proposal for the remainder of the current two-year budget cycle, which seeks to address a shortfall his office pegs at $2.3 billion through mid-2027. 
To have Ferguson’s support, he said the new tax must be used to increase eligibility and payments under the state’s Working Families Tax Credit, which is open to low- and middle-income households. It also has to allow for tax relief for the state’s small businesses. And he wants it to bolster K-12 education and reduce sales taxes.
Ferguson, a Democrat, said it’s too soon to know if adding the income tax would put the state on a sustainable budget path that diminishes the need for further cuts or tax hikes like those approved earlier this year.
He said he is “optimistic” the Legislature will approve the tax next year. 
But the work won’t be done at that point. 
“When we’re here for a bill signing, hopefully here in a couple months, it’s inevitable that two things will happen,” he said in a press conference at the state Capitol. “There will be a court challenge, for sure, right? And ultimately it’ll go before the voters.”
Ferguson, a former three-term state attorney general, said he’s confident courts would uphold the new levy, even though the state Supreme Court has ruled that income taxes are unconstitutional. 
Less than two years ago, the Legislature approved an initiative to prohibit an income tax. And voters have repeatedly rejected income taxes over the years.
Republicans are opposed. 
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, called the income tax idea a “nonstarter” given legal precedent and the 2024 initiative. He also said the proposal avoids “doing the hard work of stopping the spending addiction in Olympia.” And he fears lawmakers would later apply the tax more widely.
“People don’t want an income tax,” said Couture, the lead budget voice among House Republicans.
Ferguson said he’s open to an amendment to the state constitution codifying the $1 million threshold for the income tax, while setting it to rise with inflation.
“I want to be clear that I will not support an income tax for people who make less than $1 million in a year,” he added.
Progressives have been clamoring for an income tax on higher earners. They see it as a way to reduce the tax burden on lower-income households and to avoid further cuts to services.
“He’s looking at the same numbers we are and realizes we have to do something,” said House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle.
Ferguson’s position is a shift from a couple months ago when he said he was “skeptical” of additional revenue measures after signing off on billions of dollars in new taxes in May to fill a budget shortfall. 
If the tax is adopted, Ferguson said he wants to explore limiting sales taxes on personal hygiene products, like shampoo, deodorant and toothpaste, as well as eliminating the levies on baby products, like formula and diapers, and “essential and affordable clothing items.”
“Progressive tax reform cannot just mean increasing contributions from those who can afford it,” Ferguson said. “We must use the gains from the millionaires tax to return money directly to working families and small business owners who have been hit hard by the affordability crisis.”
Fitzgibbon said while his caucus has “a lot of enthusiasm” for the tax, he doesn’t think his colleagues would confine the tax to the uses the governor outlined.
Couture has filed a bill ahead of the legislative session that would require the state to reduce its sales tax commensurate with any tax on income.

Ferguson also said his position hasn’t changed on the so-called wealth tax that progressives have pushed for. Earlier this year, he rejected the idea when legislative Democrats backed it to balance their budget proposals. The governor warned it was untested and could get held up in court without delivering needed revenue. 
At the time, he left the door open to a scaled-back version bringing in no more than $100 million per year to see if it would survive challenges. 
He also said Tuesday he’s “not a big fan” of a statewide tax modeled on the city of Seattle’s payroll levy on companies. Progressives have identified that as another option for raising more state revenue and reducing financial pressures on lower earners. 
Lawmakers will convene for a 60-day legislative session beginning Jan. 12.

Eagle Nest Lake State Park’s Polar Bear Plunge is a free annual event sponsored by the volunteers at Friends of Eagle Nest Lake and Cimarron Canyon State Parks that invites people to brave the freezing temperatures and jump into the lake. The event is part of America’s State Parks First Day Hikes, an event that encourages people to kick off the new year by spending time outdoors enjoying the various landscapes. 
According to the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, all 35 New Mexico state parks participate in the First Day Hikes with various activities. For example, Storrie Lake State Park in Las Vegas also hosts a Polar Bear Plunge and the Rio Grande Nature Center State Park offers a New Year’s Day Nature Walk.

Gail Tate has plunged into Eagle Nest Lake two years in a row and was preparing to take her third plunge in just a few days. However, she told Source New Mexico that because the season has been warmer than usual, there’s no ice in the water. Still, she’s looking forward to taking part in the tradition, calling it a “polar run” this year.
“I had always wanted to do [a plunge]. It was on my bucket list,” Tate said. “But I had envisioned jumping into a swimming pool…. I thought one of those days I would do it, and then finding out that Eagle Nest does it every year, I thought, ‘I’m going to do that, I’m going to take the plunge, no pun intended.’”
Participants register the day of and must wear shoes as they prepare to hop in two-at-a-time into the popular fishing lake. Tate said the water comes up to about her shoulders. Plungers are quickly directed to a nearby ladder by safety personnel so they can climb out and step into towels and robes to warm back up. Participants can also bring a partner or make a friend while they’re there to hold their belongings while they’re in the water.
As a seasoned plunger and now a member of the Friends board, Tate encourages everyone she comes across to try it out for themselves and join in the “jovial” mood.
“It’s just the courage and the willingness to go out there and do it,” she said. “[The first time] was such a spiritual experience. I came out and I stood around and watched all the other plungers and cheered them on. I was totally warm because again, I got my robe on, I put my towel around my neck. It was so exhilarating. I can’t describe it, I mean, it’s just beyond.”

People of all ages take the plunge year-to-year, with some traveling to the scenic village from around the state. Tate said about 50 people participate each year, but there are many more locals and visitors who join to cheer on the plungers and enjoy hot cocoa and treats by the park’s wood-burning fireplace.
“These events bring people together and remind us why our state parks matter,” New Mexico State Parks Director Toby Velásquez said in a statement. “New Mexico’s landscapes inspire resilience and adventure, and there’s no better way to begin the year than by experiencing them firsthand.”
People can also join in a Polar Stomp hike near Eagle Nest Lake State Park earlier in the day, before taking a plunge. Other events can be found on the EMNRD event calendar.
“These traditions remind us that our parks are more than destinations,” Velásquez said. “They’re part of who we are as New Mexicans, nuestra gente, nuestras familias, y nuestra historia. We invite everyone to join us, take care of these places and make new memories for the new year ahead.

Free.,US Supreme Court in defeat for Trump blocks deployment of National Guard in Chicago,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-defeat-trump-blocks-deployment-national-guard-chicago,,"President Donald Trump for now has not met the requirements to send National Guard troops to Chicago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday afternoon in a major setback for the president.The court’s majority rejected the Trump administration’s request to stay, or halt, a lower court’s order barring federalization of National Guard troops to assist federal immigration enforcement officers in Chicago. The president is only empowered to federalize National Guard units when the troops are enforcing laws that regular military forces are legally allowed to enforce, the court said in a ruling from its emergency docket that will apply while the merits of the case are argued.The Posse Comitatus Act, passed in 1878, generally prevents the military from participating in civilian law enforcement.The decision on the eve of a five-day holiday weekend for the federal government appeared to be 6-3, with three conservative justices, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, dissenting. The ruling represented the first time the high court has weighed in on Trump’s use of the guard in several cities, though other legal fights continue.The administration had not shown why the situation in Chicago, in which residents have protested aggressive immigration enforcement, should present an exception to the law, the court majority said.“At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the majority opinion said.In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the ruling would not detract from Trump’s “core agenda.”“The President promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters,” Jackson wrote. “He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property.”Protecting federal officersIn a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whom Trump appointed during his first term, wrote that he agreed with the decision to deny the motion for a stay, but would have done so on narrower grounds.The majority opinion was overly restrictive and would block the president from using National Guard forces to protect federal property and personnel, Kavanaugh said.Alito wrote in a dissent, joined by Thomas, that their interpretation of the majority’s order could have far-reaching consequences that undermine the traditional role of the guard.It would free National Guard members to enforce immigration law, but not to provide protection to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who are assigned that function, Alito wrote. “Whatever one may think about the current administration’s enforcement of the immigration laws or the way ICE has conducted its operations, the protection of federal officers from potentially lethal attacks should not be thwarted,” Alito wrote. “I therefore respectfully dissent.”Implications for other citiesThe ruling is only in effect while the case, in which Illinois is challenging the administration’s deployment there, proceeds. But it marks a rebuke, including from a Trump appointee, of the administration’s strategy of deploying National Guard troops to assist in its aggressive immigration enforcement.Trump has ordered troops to Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Memphis, Tennessee, and Portland, Oregon, to either counter crime generally or assist federal immigration officials. Governors of Democratic-led states have strenuously pushed back against those deployments. Republican attorneys general have argued their states are harmed by the protests in Chicago and other cities that impede federal ICE officers from doing their jobs.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzer in a statement praised the ruling. “Today is a big win for Illinois and American democracy,” he said. “I am glad the Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump did not have the authority to deploy the federalized guard in Illinois. This is an important step in curbing the Trump Administration's consistent abuse of power and slowing Trump’s march toward authoritarianism.”",,,,2025-12-23 17:57:53.776358

Wages could be garnished as early as 30 days after borrowers receive notice.The agency noted that collections activities would be conducted only after borrowers were given sufficient notice and the opportunity to pay back their loans.Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel for the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, blasted the decision as “cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible” in a Tuesday statement. “As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers’ wages instead of defending borrowers’ right to affordable payments,” Yu added. The agency resumed collections for defaulted federal student loans in May, following a pause that started during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of defaulting on one’s student loans, a borrower can have their wages garnished, and the “loan holder can order your employer to withhold up to 15% of your disposable pay to collect your defaulted debt” without being taken to court, according to Federal Student Aid, an office of the Education Department. With wage garnishment, borrowers have the right to “be sent a notice that explains ED’s intention to garnish your wages in 30 days, the nature and amount of your debt, your opportunity to inspect and copy records relating to your debt, your right to object to garnishment, and your option to avoid garnishment by voluntary repayments,” according to FSA.",,,,2025-12-23 17:57:53.776358

(Provided by Montana State University)Montana State University will be the site of a new U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
The new Community Engagement Office will support workforce development in the state and region, especially in advanced manufacturing and computing, according to a news release from Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office.
The federal Patent and Trademark Office announced the selection of Montana this month as the first of “several” new Community Engagement Offices formerly served by the Rocky Mountain Regional Outreach Office.
The regional office in Denver is set to close. In a news release announcing the closure in October, the Patent and Trademark Office said physical space had become less necessary for the work.
A recent announcement from MSU said the flagship was selected based on its “robust research activity,” its graduate level programs in areas that lead to innovations, and its ability to commercialize technology and develop businesses.
MSU spokesperson Mike Becker said Monday the timeline for the opening wasn’t firm yet, nor was a specific location on campus, but he anticipated the office would be running within a year or so.
Once it opens, MSU said the Bozeman office will join Dallas and San Francisco as the largest hubs west of the Mississippi providing patent and trademark services to inventors and startups.
“We’re just thrilled to be the first announced for sure,” Becker said.
In a statement, MSU President Brock Tessman said the office will be a resource to entrepreneurs and innovators across the Rocky Mountain West.
“It will provide access to opportunity for first-time inventors, small business owners and students throughout the region, leading to the kind of growth and innovation that drives our region’s prosperity,” Tessman said.
MSU, the largest university in the state, reported in 2025 a new record level of research expenditures with $288.7 million, most from federal funders, such as the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture.
In a September letter, Gianforte encouraged U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to consider Bozeman as a potential location for a community outreach or satellite office.
Gianforte cited MSU as an anchor research institution as part of the rationale and described the region as a “growing tech hub corridor.”
The governor noted support for a Montana location also came from U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, The Montana Photonics & Quantum Alliance, Montana Chamber of Commerce, the Montana Retail Association, and the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education.
In a statement following the selection of MSU, the governor said the choice to locate the office at the Bozeman flagship “rightfully recognizes Montana’s growing advanced manufacturing and tech sectors.”
Gianforte, Daines and Sheehy have residences in or near Bozeman, and the Gianforte Family Foundation is a major donor to MSU.
“This new USPTO office will play a strategic role in expanding opportunity for all Montanans, providing innovators with the tools to protect their inventions and grow their operations, while ensuring Montana remains at the cutting edge of technology, security, and economic growth,” Gianforte said in a statement.
MSU said its scientists perform “cutting-edge research” in engineering, national security, cybersecurity, bioscience, energy, agriculture, optics and quantum computing, among many other fields.
Alison Harmon, vice president of research and economic development at MSU, said the new office will help accelerate commercialization and connect innovation with societal impact.
The MSU office will serve Montana, Colorado, Idaho, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, according to the federal agency’s announcement.



Research at MSU
In the news release about the patent and trademark office, MSU highlighted some of its current research:
Through a National Science Foundation-funded program called Accelerating Research Translation, MSU has supported what are known as seed translational research projects, or STRPs, providing funding and mentorship to directly advance promising research toward public benefit. The ART program at MSU has supported work that includes:

A digital learning platform to help middle and high school students explore the college experience to prepare for their futures
An innovative wearable medical device to help patients from rural and tribal communities take part in clinical trials
Technology related to CRISPR gene-editing, which has applications ranging from vaccine development to the treatment of genetic diseases
Tools to detect algal blooms in rivers and other waterways
Genetic research to increase yield in durum wheat, which is used for making pasta and other grains
Computers designed to function in space and resist cyberattacks, one of which was recently sent to the moon on a NASA mission

MSU is also home to units and partnerships that promote connections among researchers, industry and federal agencies to bring technologies to market. Those include:

The Institute for National Security Research and Education, which strengthens national security by delivering technologies, supporting researchers and preparing leaders to safeguard the future of Montana and the United States.
MSU’s TechLink Center, which is the Department of Defense’s only national partnership intermediary for technology transfer. Since 1999, TechLink has helped companies around the country license DOD inventions to create new products and services, transferring more than 1,000 DOD inventions to industry. The center facilitates approximately 60% of all DOD license agreements nationwide.
MilTech is an authorized National Government Partnership Intermediary that helps bring innovative technology to the U.S. government quickly, reliably and cost-effectively, MSU said. Established in 2004, MilTech has more than 300 active and completed projects with DOD and Department of Homeland Security.
In 2025, the DOD named MSU a Defense Innovation Unit OnRamp Hub, which will bring the university’s cutting-edge facilities and trained researchers together with companies to scale up and rapidly field technologies for use in defense projects. MSU said the hub will lead to more connections between MSU and Montana’s business and technology communities and DIU funding opportunities.

Melissa H. Ziobron announced her candidacy to regain the 34th House District seat that she gave up in 2018.","With her successor retiring, former state Rep. Melissa H. Ziobron, R-East Haddam, is running to regain the 34th House District seat that she gave up to unsuccessfully run for state Senate in 2018.
If she wins, her immediate reward will be about an $84,000 pay cut.
Ziobron is currently a senior staffer at the General Assembly, overseeing fiscal policy for the House Republican minority, a full time job that pays about $132,000. It keeps her close to the fray, but not a participant.
“The last few years, I’ve been extremely frustrated to watch taxpayer funds spent without true accountability,” Ziobron said.
She lost a close race for the open 33rd Senate District seat in 2018, a brutal year for Republicans in the midterm election during President Donald Trump’s first term. Democrats won huge majorities, ending what had been a closely divided state legislature.
Her House seat remained in Republican hands, won by Irene Haines, who would simultaneously serve as selectwoman in East Haddam. Haines is exiting politics: She didn’t run for the local office last month, and she is not running for the House next year.
Ziobron said she is a fan of the famous Teddy Roosevelt quote:
“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena…”
Ziobron was elected to the House in 2012, flipping an open Democratic seat. Over the next two cycles, Republicans made steady gains in 2014 and 2016, growing from 52 seats to 71 — just five short of a majority in her last two-year term.
Combined with an 18-18 tie in the Senate, the close margins gave Republicans a greater voice in budget negotiations of which she was a part, producing the fiscal guardrails that still limit spending today. But Democrats since have won twice as many seats as Republicans.
Still, Ziobron wants a seat in the House, not on the sidelines.
“I’ve done what I can as staff, but I know I can do more with a microphone in my hand,” she said. “I want to be able to put my head on the pillow at night.”
Ziobron said she has not been happy watching the General Assembly change. She said lawmakers have stepped away from accountability-based budgeting, and she disapproves of the limited remote voting allowed since COVID.
“I’ve watched the legislative process in Connecticut lose its seriousness,” she said “I watch legislators vote from their cars.”
Her district also has changed since the redistricting after the 2020 census: It now includes East Haddam, East Hampton and Salem, with Salem replacing Colchester from her time in the House.
Ziobron said the decision to run again, giving up a full time job and salary, was made with her husband.
“This was certainly a family decision,” she said. “He has watched me be very unhappy.”
She filed papers creating a campaign committee last week. An hour after the Connecticut Mirror called her Tuesday for this story, she formally announced her candidacy.
“I was planning on waiting to announce this until after Christmas, but it seems the news will break sooner than I had planned,” she wrote on Facebook.
In her announcement statement, she said her core values have not changed.
“What has changed is my depth of knowledge and understanding of our state budget system, still in need of reform and increased transparency,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2060-e1525293090445.jpg,,,2025-12-23 17:57:53.776358

LaMonica McIver speaks outside of Delaney Hall after she, Rep. Rob Menendez, and New York Rep. Yvette Clarke visited the Newark migrant jail for an oversight visit on Dec. 23, 2025. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)NEWARK — Days after immigration officials announced the death of a detainee at Newark migrant jail Delaney Hall, Rep. LaMonica McIver visited the facility for the first time since prosecutors allege she assaulted federal agents there during a melee in May.
McIver’s visit coincided with a new filing in the Newark Democrat’s criminal case in which her attorneys accuse prosecutors of failing to produce key evidence that they say shows bias among the agents involved in the scuffle, including one agent’s use of a racial slur in a group text the morning of the incident that led to McIver’s indictment.
“It is very traumatic to be back here personally,” McIver told reporters after Tuesday’s visit. “But at the same time, I have a responsibility to serve the people and protect the people of the 10th Congressional District, and that is why I had to put aside my traumatic experience here and come back here and represent them and see what is happening inside of this awful detention center.”
Reps. Rob Menendez (D-08) and Yvette Clarke (D-New York) joined McIver for the three-hour visit to Delaney Hall. They said there were no incidents involving staff of prison owner Geo Group, but they left with major concerns about inmates’ medical care, their access to food and water, and prison officials’ transparency.
They said dozens of detainees they met with are sick and coughing, are housed in overcrowded units, don’t have access to proper food, and are forced to wait weeks for medical attention. Detainees compared the jail to a slaughterhouse, Menendez said, “because they know they will hit a dead end no matter what they try to do.”
“These are human beings. These are people who are taken out of our communities and are being held here — on your dime, on the American taxpayer’s dime, while Geo Group makes more money than they ever have in their entire history,” Menendez said. “That’s what’s happening inside there.”
More than 950 people are being held at Delaney Hall, double the number from when Menendez last visited. Lawmakers said many of the detainees don’t have criminal records, and some were arrested in courthouses and legal offices while working on their immigration status. Other detainees are in the country legally on student visas, and one man inside is married to a U.S. military service member, they said.
As they have in the past, the Democratic lawmakers condemned the escalating detention tactics of the Trump administration and called on the jail to close. McIver said they’ll continue to conduct oversight regularly until it shutters.

Menendez was also with McIver on May 9, when the two, along with Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), visited the jail for an unannounced inspection. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, was also there, and federal agents arrested him and accused him of trespassing (they quickly dropped the charge when video surfaced of a prison guard inviting Baraka onto the property).
During the scuffle that ensued when agents moved to detain Baraka, prosecutors allege, McIver shoved two guards, and they later charged her with assault. McIver has pleaded not guilty and has argued that agents caused the chaos that erupted when Baraka was arrested.
One of her attorneys, Lee Cortes, demanded in a Tuesday filing in her case that the government release more communications between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents the day of Baraka’s arrest. They said a “paltry” 54 text messages were ultimately produced after U.S. District Court Judge Jamel K. Semper in October ordered their release.
Those text messages, Cortes says, are material and favorable to McIver’s defense. In a May 10 text message sent in a group chat, an ICE officer who witnessed Baraka’s arrest says they doubt any Congress members present would be arrested because their conduct “wasn’t enough like a swing or anything,” according to Cortes. One of the agents McIver is accused of assaulting was in that group chat and did not dispute that characterization, the letter reads.
Cortez also alleges that an ICE agent accused of shoving McIver that day used a racial slur in a Signal group chat with other agents. Another officer responded to say a Black officer included in the chat “is having a stroke right now,” and other agents responded with laughing emojis, Cortes’ letter says.
“That type of behavior is material impeachment evidence for any of the officers who participated in the Signal group, particularly given the group’s later aggressive treatment of Mayor Baraka and Congresswoman McIver,” wrote Cortes.
Semper rejected McIver’s bid to throw out two of three counts she faces. He is still deciding on the third.

Some of the heat is coming from Connecticut lawmakers.
The segment was about the conditions at a notoriously harsh El Salvadoran prison where migrants are being detained after being deported from the United States. Hours before it was supposed to air, CBS editor-in-chief Bari Weiss made multiple change requests, and then the segment was ultimately pulled before airing in the U.S.
Sharyn Alfonsi, who reported the story, said in a message to colleagues obtained by The New York Times that it had been cleared by rigorous internal reviews and was pulled for political reasons.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) agreed.
“The segment didn’t air because Trump has effectively taken editorial control of CBS,” Murphy said. “What happened a few months ago is that CBS’s parent company got bought. It got bought in a sale in which Trump basically said to the company that was buying it, if you want CBS, you’ve got to make CBS be more conservative. And you’ve essentially got to answer to me.”
In a three-minute social media video, Murphy went on to say media company mergers were making it more difficult for news organizations to report fairly.
“It previews what’s coming in American media as more and more networks get bought up by these giant, billion-dollar corporations that care only about profit and are willing to give Donald Trump editorial control in order for their CEOs and investors to make billions off of these sales,” Murphy said. “This is how democracy dies.”
In a statement, Weiss said the piece would air at a later date after more reporting was done.
“Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom,” Weiss said in a statement.
The piece aired in Canada and has since circulated online.

Clay Yarborough, R-Jacksonville. (Photo by Colin Hackley)There may be yet another legislative tussle in 2026 over cultural flashpoints dealing with parental rights and gender-affirming care.
A Jacksonville Republican filed a bill Tuesday to broaden the power of Florida’s attorney general to investigate health care providers who allegedly violate Florida’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors as well as state and local government employees who violate the state’s “Parents’ Bill of Rights.”
Sen. Clay Yarborough’s bill, SB 1010, would amend the 2023 transgender care statute to make it illegal for a health care provider to aid or abet a minor in search of the care. Providers who help minors could face a third-degree felony. The draft doesn’t define “aid and abet.”
If the attorney general determines a health care provider violated the ban, the state’s top law enforcement officer could file a a civil suit against the practitioner, seeking penalties of up to $100,000 per violation. Any damages recovered would accrue to the benefit of the minor.
The attorney general would have to file the suit within two years of the investigation’s launch.
There is no companion measure in the House to date.
The bill empowers Florida’s attorney general — now James Uthmeier — to investigate alleged violations of the 2021 law establishing a “Parents’ Bill of Rights.”
Uthmeier, appointed to the position earlier this year by Gov. Ron DeSantis, has already made parental rights a focus. In April, Uthmeier announced creation of an Office of Parental Rights.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The 2021 law bans political subdivisions and other governmental entities from infringing upon the fundamental right of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and mental health of his or her minor child without demonstrating a compelling state interest.
SB 1010 amends the 2021 statute to allow the attorney general to investigate alleged violations and, within two years of the findings, file civil suits seeking penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation. 
The bill creates a specific cause of action against health care practitioners and state and local government employees who violate the Parents’ Bill of Rights.
Specific to health care, the Parents’ Bill of Rights guarantees, unless prohibited by law, the right of parents to make health care decisions, to access and review all medical records of the minor child, and to consent in writing before any record of their child’s blood or DNA is created, stored, or shared.
Health care practitioners who violate the existing law now only face disciplinary action.
Protections for political and ideological beliefs in school
Another Yarborough bill filed Tuesday would amend state law protecting religious liberty in school to include students who express political or ideological beliefs and the school clubs they belong to.
The bill would allow a school district to prohibit, limit, and restrict expression that the First Amendment does not protect. The districts also could limit expression that is “unwelcome, and so severe, pervasive, and subjectively and objectively offensive, that  a student is  effectively denied equal access to educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.”
Any student group or club or student whose rights are violated could sue the school district for declaratory and injunctive relief, statutory punitive damages, reasonable attorney fees, and costs. The bill would provide punitive damages between $15,000 and $25,000 for the student or student club if they prevail.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma City nonprofit is aiming to reduce homelessness among teens aging out of the foster care system, one tiny home at a time. 
Pivot, a program that offers teens aging out of fostercare food, shelter, and therapy, began building tiny homes in 2015. Multiple tiny homes have been built over the past decade on Pivot’s property as a long-term transitional living solution for at-risk youth, or those who are homeless are lack access to permanent housing.
Janeal Jones, Pivot’s director of transitional living, said that the tiny homes have been a “huge success.” They offer teens in crisis a fresh start. 
“We used to house teens at an apartment complex, but we later navigated the same concept to be on the property of Pivot by building tiny homes, so that teens can have closer access to food, therapy, and other resources,” Jones said.
Currently, there are 41 tiny homes on Pivot’s property, which are supervised 24 hours a day throughout the week. 
It costs $100 a month to live in a tiny home, and occupants usually range in age from 16 to 24 years. Each home contains a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and dining room.
Occupants have to remain out of trouble, continue to finish school, and have a job to pay for the rent of a tiny home. They also have access to a food pantry, a medical clinic, therapy, life skills, and professional development classes, according to Pivot’s website. Occupants are chosen to live in the tiny homes based on their financial, parental, and shelter needs. 
There is no wait list for the tiny homes.
According to the National Youth Foster Initiative, which focuses on transforming the nation’s child welfare systems, about 20% of foster children become homeless when they turn 18 and are emancipated from the system. 
Nationally, about 1 in 4 will be homeless within four years of aging out of foster care, the group found.
The Oklahoma Department of Human Services has embraced the tiny home model as a way to help shelter some of its teens aging out of foster care. 
In July 2024, the nonprofit celebrated the opening of 15 new tiny homes and a community center that were funded by a $3 million grant from the Oklahoma Department of Human Services. 
“The tiny homes and community center will give young people much-needed stability and support while they work with our Oklahoma Successful Adulthood Program to implement longer-term housing plans and design their own future,” said then-Director Deborah Shropshire in a statement. “We are grateful for the many ways the community has embraced foster care and for the additional pathways this partnership will create for the young people we serve.”
Carrie Snodgrass, a spokesperson for the Department of Human Services, said recently that the agency does not have any plans to fund any additional homes at this time.

Gov. Burt Jones. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia’s State Election Board will see at least one new member in 2026. 
Lt. Gov. Burt Jones appointed Salleigh Grubbs, a top Georgia GOP official and elections activist, to the panel. Her appointment is not expected to alter the partisan balance on the board, which has a strong Republican majority that has been aligned with President Donald Trump. 
Grubbs is the former head of the Cobb County Republican Party, and currently serves as the first vice chair of the Georgia Republican Party. 
“It was my pleasure to appoint Salleigh Grubbs to the State Election Board,” Jones said in a statement. “I have no doubt she will bring significant passion and expertise to overseeing Georgia’s elections.”
She will replace former state Sen. Rick Jeffares, who has served on the board since the start of 2024. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the AJC reported that he was resigning for personal reasons.
Grubbs said Tuesday that she is grateful for the appointment.
“I look forward to serving in a bipartisan way to help the other members on the State Election Board and will serve with integrity and character,” she said in a statement.
The five-member State Election Board is tasked with overseeing cases involving potential violations of election laws and issuing guidance to help elections run more smoothly. However, in recent years members of the board have been accused of acting beyond their authority, including approving a series of last-minute election rule changes ahead of the 2024 general election that could have made it easier to delay certifying the results, and embarking on a yearslong endeavor to prove wrongdoing in the 2020 presidential election. That year, former President Joe Biden won in Georgia by nearly 12,000 votes.
State election panel recommends ending no-excuse absentee voting in Georgia

In 2024, Grubbs was one of the key supporters of an election rule proposal allowing county election board members to request a virtually unlimited amount of records and documents relating to voting machines and vote tabulation before certifying the results of an election. She also advocated for a rule requiring election workers to hand-count ballots to ensure that the total number of ballots cast is not greater than the total number of voters who submitted ballots. Those changes were passed by the board but invalidated ahead of the 2024 election by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas A. Cox Jr.
The Georgia Supreme Court permanently struck down four of the rules in June, concluding that members of the board exceeded their authority in attempting to implement guidelines that went beyond the scope of Georgia’s election laws.
This year, Grubbs co-authored a failed proposal seeking to clarify the circumstances under which voters can switch to paper ballots rather than using ballot-marking devices. Opponents of the proposal worried that the rule would go beyond the scope of the board’s authority.
Grubbs also established a fundraising campaign earlier this year for the board’s vice chair, Janice Johnston, after she was sued by the watchdog nonprofit organization American Oversight for refusing to turn over her emails in response to an open records request. The campaign raised over $29,000, including one anonymous donation of $10,000, according to The Guardian. The webpage for the fundraiser has since been taken down, and the board later settled the lawsuit for $50,000.
Georgia GOP chair Josh McKoon celebrated Grubbs’ appointment.
“Salleigh Grubbs brings a strong record of leadership and a deep commitment to election integrity,” McKoon said in a statement. “Her experience and dedication to fair, transparent elections will serve Georgians well.”

(Photo by wera Rodsawang/Getty Stock Photo)You wouldn’t know it from daily news across the nation, state and city, but many schools are beating the odds and achieving outstanding results. They are all a gift to our schoolchildren.
It’s not easy to single one out, but I am particularly in touch with the Hampstead Hill Academy, a neighborhood K-8 school up the street from where I lived in the Canton area of Baltimore City. It’s a shiny holiday ornament: Proof that a school predominantly serving students from low-income backgrounds and students of color can succeed at high rates.
Here are some facts and figures.
Student achievement. Hampstead Hill is the only city school to earn a 5-star (highest) ranking in the 2025 state report cards. It ranks 16th in middle schools and top 25 in elementary schools statewide.
It has the highest test scores overall in  the city, with 63.9% of  students achieving proficiency on at least one of the state tests. It topped second place Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (my alma mater) with 60.7%.
On the Maryland State Department of Education school report cards.  Hampstead Hill is the highest performing city elementary or middle school based on academic, school quality and student success measures.

Views of writers are their own.




On absenteeism. Hampstead Hill’s chronic absentee rate of around 9% is well below the state  average of around 30% and city schools’ average of around 49%.   Its daily attendance rate of 95% substantially exceeds the overall rates for both the city and state.
On measures of family satisfaction. An unpublished report indicates overall family satisfaction was 96% compared to 83% for all city schools
So what is Hampstead Hill’s secret sauce? There are many tangible and intangible factors but here are a top five.

Leadership. The principal Matt Hornbeck has great relationships with teachers and parents. He’s a self-starter — aggressive in his goals while being collaborative. An outside unpublished national report on leadership of school principals ranked him in the top 99.4 percentile nationwide. Another measure of his leadership is the over $12 million that he raised to build a second facility on the school site which houses students, a gym and community events.
Smart and relentless focus on teacher recruitment and retention. Hornbeck told a reporter, “If there is a non-negotiable, it’s finding and keeping the very best teachers. Teachers are the whole game.” Hampstead Hill’s retention rate beats city and statewide averages.
Longevity and continuity. Hornbeck has served over 20 years as the Hampstead Hill principal. Before that, he was immersed in city schools as a student, teacher and parent. The average tenure for city superintendents nationwide is around five years.
Charter school status. Hampstead Hill is a charter school which is part of the six-school network under the Baltimore Curriculum Project. Charter school status offers more flexibility and BCP provides valuable support.
It runs in the family. Hornbeck’s father, David Hornbeck, was Maryland state and Philadelphia superintendent and a notable national presence, and his brother Mark is the accomplished principal of nearby Wolfe Street Academy.

Many other schools have some or all of these ingredients (except the family roots). So, if we know a secret sauce, how do we get it cooking in other schools in the city and elsewhere?
Not easily. My overriding impression is that the success factors at Hampstead Hill are not all that dramatically different from familiar school improvement strategies; rather, it’s that they’re executed at a higher level. One lesson is that school systems must pay more attention to effective implementation of instructional and school climate best practices.
Hornbeck says we’re “doing what works well,” with some innovative add-ons. In particular, he cites their “restorative practices” program which builds relationships and healthy communication among students, teachers and parents.
Whatever the exact Hampstead Hill gift package, we should celebrate the extraordinary dedication of all public school educators. They are year-in and year-out blessings.

Tim Walz speculated Tuesday that an influx of federal immigration officials will be present in Minnesota during the next few weeks and suggested that the Trump administration will want to make more arrests during the holidays because that would be “especially cruel” and “especially mean-spirited.”
Walz, surrounded by faith leaders and elected officials, said his administration isn’t made aware of the details of immigration raids, but Minnesotans stand by their immigrant neighbors and won’t be intimidated by President Donald Trump’s targeted campaign to increase arrests in the state.
Though unconfirmed, the governor said Minnesotans should expect more federal agents in the streets in the coming days, as soon as Christmas Eve.
“If I were a betting person, they will do it over these holiday seasons, because it makes it especially cruel, makes it especially mean-spirited. It makes it especially traumatizing for communities that wish to gather and celebrate in their faith,” said Walz, who is running for a third, four-year term.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said that if tensions between federal officials and Minnesota protesters continue to intensify, violence could ensue.
“I am gravely concerned that if we continue on this present trajectory, somebody is going to get killed,” Frey said.
On Sunday, a federal immigration officer fired a weapon after he was struck by the vehicle of a fleeing suspect in St. Paul, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
Last week, the ACLU of Minnesota sued federal immigration authorities, alleging that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and their leaders are routinely violating the constitutional rights of people protesting their actions.
DHS says it has made over 670 arrests since “Operation Metro Surge” began, the Star Tribune reported, but the paper hasn’t been able to independently verify that number.
Walz on Tuesday said that Trump is targeting Democratic states and cities with immigration raids and suggested Trump is sending an influx of agents to Minnesota to distract from negative press coverage.

For years the National Insurance Crime Bureau ranked Albuquerque as the worst city in the nation for car theft. Officials blamed Hyundai and Kia, in particular, and said viral videos showed how easy it is to steal those compared to other vehicles. 
As part of the recent settlement, Hyundai and Kia will pay up to $4.5 million to customers whose cars were recently stolen or damaged and will pay an additional $4.5 million in penalties to states across the U.S. 
Both manufacturers will equip all vehicles sold in the U.S. with industry standard anti-theft technology and offer free ignition cylinder protectors to people who drive eligible models. 
“Consumers should never have to worry that their vehicle is an easy target because manufacturers failed to include basic, industry-standard safeguards,” Torrez said in a statement. “New Mexicans rely on their cars every day, and when companies cut corners, it puts families and public safety at risk.” 
Residents who previously downloaded software updates but still had their cars stolen on or after April 29 are eligible to file a restitution claim, Torrez’s office said. Hyundai drivers can do so online at HKMultistateimmobilizersettlement.com and Kia users can do so online at customercare.kiausa.com/SWLD or by phone at 1-800-333-4542.
Torrez first signed on to a letter to Kia and Hyundai in 2023 and urged the manufacturers to immediately remedy the problem. Torrez and 22 other attorneys general characterized the companies’ recent moves — which included software updates on affected vehicles and ignition cylinder protectors for the cars that couldn’t download the software patch — as insufficient. 
“The recent announcement of a customer service campaign – not a recall – which combines warning stickers, longer alarms and a software upgrade, is positive news but less than is called for under the circumstances. Our concerns with the adequacy of the newly-announced measures are informed by your companies’ slow response and lack of acceptance of responsibility for the crisis over the past few years,” they wrote. “Your companies’ decisions not to install anti-theft immobilizers as standard equipment on certain vehicles sold in the United States has caused ongoing consumer harm and undermined public safety in communities across the country. It is well past time that you acknowledge your companies’ role and take swift and comprehensive action to remedy it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Raul.jpg,,,2025-12-23 16:12:12.822151

But the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in a case involving a Billings man who was patrolling a neighborhood next to an elementary school that the Legislature may have created a legal loophole in the state that narrows gun-free school zones to the school properties themselves, which fall under the control of local school boards.
The concealed-carry law has become a sort of a law of unintended consequences: It effectually nullifies the gun-free zone around the schools, and it affects law enforcement officers as much as civilians.
The federal appeals court reasoned that the Montana Legislature uniquely created this loophole when it rewrote guns laws in such a way that all citizens, unless they have been otherwise convicted of certain crimes or deemed ineligible to own a gun, have the right to carry a concealed weapon. Concealed weapons are only barred in certain places, or if the property owners expressly prohibit them. Otherwise, the federal court ruled that most residents have a “presumptive” right to carry, rather than needing a concealed-carry permit issued by a state or local authority. This is often called “permitless carry,” or “constitutional carry,” because the courts and legislature have said the right to carry weapons is ensured by the Second Amendment and no further paperwork or permission is needed.
And it was because Gabriel Metcalf had this right that he routinely patrolled the busy neighborhood in central Billings, directly across from Broadwater Elementary, with a firearm, including a 20-gauge shotgun, worrying community members, teachers and parents. Billings Police were called dozens of times to the area on reports of a man with a gun wandering around or near the elementary school. And dozen of times, police spoke with Metcalf, but were unable to do much more than that, even when parents spoke out.
Metcalf told the police that he was patrolling his house and neighborhood because of an abusive former neighbor who had stalked him and his mother. Meanwhile, school officials put up a black tarp that covered a fence and the view of Metcalf’s house, and moved the students to a part of the playground area farthest away.
After dozens of calls, federal law enforcement officers were able to arrest Metcalf, alleging he had broken federal laws guaranteeing a gun-free school zone, usually a 1,000-foot area around a school prohibiting carrying firearms.
But the law grants exceptions for authorized school staff, law enforcement officers and those with concealed carry permits. And it’s for that reason that the Ninth Circuit says that because Montana grants every citizen the right, it must also mean that every citizen is authorized to carry within that buffer zone.
“Our decision is a narrow one,” the ruling said. “Metcalf was the first, and to our knowledge, only person in Montana to have raised the license exception in response to a charge for violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act.”
The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court dismissed charges against Metcalf, exonerating him as he challenged his arrest and prosecution. The court overturned the federal district court decision, saying that while it understood the concerns of the community, the Montana Legislature had created the loophole, and it would be Montana’s lawmakers who would have to close it, according to the ruling.
“The Montana Legislature has made clear that it enacted its state license to comply with federal law, and it did so by directly licensing individuals by statute, rather than by delegating authority to separate state or local agencies,” the ruling said. “Because Congress did not make a clear statement prohibiting Montana’s decision to act, the legislature, rather than through delegated authority other than state officials, Metcalf’s proffered interpretation finds support.”
Attorneys and lawmakers say the case, and the Montana Legislature, may have figured out how to essentially nullify gun-free school zones, a law that many Second Amendment enthusiasts have targeted for years, with mixed results.
The Daily Montanan spoke with several Billings school officials who acknowledged the loophole, but said they feared speaking publicly about the situation for fear of restarting the problem. They said since Metcalf was released, there hasn’t been any neighborhood patrolling with guns.
Still, attorneys and lawmakers say the issue remains, and in Montana, gun-free school zones have now shrunk to school property itself.
Jeffrey Weldon, a Billings attorney who specializes in school and education law, said that the ruling does change the buffer zone around the schools, but he stressed that control of school property hasn’t changed — that’s up to the local school boards, which are given latitude to set their own rules that must be obeyed, with or without a concealed-carry permit.
He said the gun-free school zones have had a number of challenges, including what a nearby property owner can do on their own property. He also said that many people who pass by schools with firearms locked in their cars could have also tripped over the technicality of the law.
“So the law has been limited already,” Weldon explained in an interview.
He said the new court ruling will have the biggest effect on law enforcement. That is, law enforcement won’t be able to do much if the same situation happens, worrying parents, teachers and neighbors.
For now, given the political climate in Montana, Weldon said that a fix would have to come from the Legislature, something that’s unlikely.
“The court said that the remedy is legislative,” Weldon said.
In Montana, the Legislature will not meet again till 2027 — a little more than a year. Even now, there seems to be little appetite to revisit the concealed carry laws, even with the ruling.
Rep. James Reavis, a Democrat whose district includes Broadwater Elementary in Billings, declined an interview request when contacted by the Daily Montanan. However, he did release a statement:


“I do not want to comment on the individual facts of the case, which involve some legally complex issues. But I will say that someone openly brandishing a gun outside of their private property to walk around the sidewalk and the alley in such a way that frightens the neighbors is not responsible gun ownership. Police should have the power to do something when the open carry of firearms outside of private property is frightening the neighbors. It doesn’t even have to be a criminal remedy.”
 
Sen. Mike Yakawich, a Billings Republican whose district also includes Broadwater Elementary, said he spoke with teachers, parents and administrators about the issue.
“They’re more skittish than a politician when it comes to this,” Yakawich said. “They do not see this as a problem.”
He said in Montana, seeing someone carry a firearm is normal. And he said he knows many people who carry a concealed firearm.
“This issue is not guns,” Yakawich said.
Yakawich said he knows first hand about gun violence. “South Side Mike,” a nickname he’s given himself, has been shot at twice while working on the city’s South Side as both an activist and city council member before moving to the Legislature. Both times, Yakawich noted a bullet nearly missed him. Both times, he said the gunfire was retribution for organizing marches against drug dealers and crime in a movement meant for neighbors to reclaim their neighborhoods.
“I do not advocate a change in the gun laws, but I advocate greater education about gun laws,” he said. “We have to accentuate the educational part of firearms.”
Yakawich suggested that concerned neighborhood residents around elementary schools organize, go door to door, and speak with residents about rights, but also about being more sensitive around schools.
“The problem is complex, and people who carry firearms are generally very respectable,” Yakawich said. “Then we look at behavioral health and a person who shoots another person has massive mental health issues. That person is an exception.
“If there is concern among parents, the question should be: How are we addressing mental health? It’s not just a man with a gun. It’s behavioral health issue, and there is no magic wand. It’s easier to pass a law than make people well.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG-7188-scaled-e1733786147380-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-12-23 15:58:21.778403

“I’m not going to play coy and say ‘No, I’ve never thought about it,’ — of course I think about it,” Balint told NOTUS’ Reese Gorman.

This story was produced in partnership with NOTUS, a publication from the nonprofit, nonpartisan Allbritton Journalism Institute. VTDigger has partnered with NOTUS to cover federal actions affecting Vermont.



U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt, said she would consider running for independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ seat should he decide not to run for reelection in 2030.
“I’m not going to play coy and say ‘No, I’ve never thought about it,’ — of course I think about it,” Balint told NOTUS’ Reese Gorman on the latest episode of the On NOTUS podcast.
“If it happens, it happens,” she said. “Vermonters love people who are doing a great job and are competent. And we love our incumbents. … So if there comes a time when a Senate seat opens up, I will seriously think about it.”
Balint recalled a conversation she had with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Ma, about the opportunities in the Senate versus the House.
“She said it’s just a different level of power than you have in the House to affect positive change on your constituents,” Balint recalled of the conversation.
“(I) would love to be part of that if the timing is right and if it fits what Vermonters need,” she added.
Balint quickly rose through the ranks of the state Senate and was first elected to the U.S. House in 2022. Her election was historic in multiple ways: She is the first woman and first openly gay person to represent Vermont in Congress. And before her election, Vermont was the last state to have never elected a woman to Congress.
The lawmaker discussed how she lacked political role models who were openly gay, but pointed to Harvey Milk as an early example.
“Milk was one of the first openly gay politicians in the country, and he was assassinated,” Balint said. “And so the messages early on were definitely (that) it’s not safe to be out as a politician.”
However, she said it was watching the events of Jan. 6, 2021, unfold at the Capitol from her office at the Vermont statehouse that she felt a call to run for Congress.
“I’ll just be very candid with you, my grandfather was killed in the Holocaust,” Balint told Reese. “I know what authoritarian tendencies look like. I know how the story ends. It doesn’t end well.”
“It was just this deep, deep feeling of like, democracy itself is in danger because of the way that Trump showed up in his role,” she continued. “And I knew it would take a long, long time to undo the damage.”
In each weekly episode of On NOTUS, host Reese Gorman sits down with lawmakers to talk about what inspired them to come to Washington. In recent episodes, House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La, said he wants to take the feelings out of politics, Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer,  R-Mn, described the ideal congressional candidate, and U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wa, explained how she navigates a hyperpartisan Congress.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Two Democratic members of Congress from Michigan are calling for a thorough federal investigation into the death of a man who died while detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In a letter sent Tuesday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, U.S. Reps. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) said Nenko Gantchev’s Dec. 15 death at the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, is part of a “deeply troubling pattern of deaths in ICE custody.” 
They noted that ICE has reported at least 30 detainee deaths this year — the highest total since 2004 — including Gantchev’s, which was the fourth reported detainee death in a four-day period in December.
Gantchev, a Bulgarian national arrested by ICE on Sept. 23 and held pending removal proceedings, was found unresponsive in his cell and pronounced dead at about 9:54 p.m., according to ICE. 
The agency has described the cause as “suspected natural causes” while the official cause remains under investigation.
In their letter, the lawmakers outlined specific questions they wanted answers to, including whether ICE conducted all required medical screening, care and supervision of Gantchev; whether staff followed required procedures after finding him unresponsive; and whether complaints about his treatment or conditions at North Lake were logged and addressed.

They also asked for details on current staffing, medical screening policies, and conditions at the facility, which reopened this year and has seen rapid population growth.
“Since reopening in June of this year, reports indicate that North Lake’s detainee population has swelled in recent months due to escalated immigration enforcement activities under this Administration,” Stevens and Scholten wrote, adding that the detainee population growth at the facility has coincided with complaints of inhumane conditions and inadequate medical care.
“We all believe in a secure border, but securing our border does not require abandoning our commitment to the rule of law and protecting and honoring human dignity,” the lawmakers concluded, requesting a preliminary response from DHS and ICE by Friday, Jan. 9, 2026, “to ensure justice for those who have died in custody already, and safety of those currently detained.”
The GEO Group, a federally contracted private company, operates the North Lake facility which shut down in 2022 before reopening in June of this year under a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract. 
The facility, which has drawn numerous protests from activists, is now the largest ICE detention center in the Midwest and one of the largest in the nation.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 15:58:21.778403

Similar proposals had previously been proposed in the legislature with bipartisan support, but never received a final vote in the Senate until earlier this month.

Victims voluntarily leaving their jobs will have to provide what the bill calls “reasonable” proof of violence against them, such as a recent protective order, medical records, or a statement from a qualified professional like a counselor or shelter worker.
If a victim has no documentation, they can still apply for fast-tracked unemployment under the law, but will be asked to provide another form of evidence that “reasonably proves domestic violence” within 150 days. But, the state Department of Labor may waive the requirement.
Documentation of domestic violence will remain confidential under the law.

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Montana U.S. Sen. Steve Daines has restarted his efforts to rollback federal designations from some of Montana’s Wilderness Study Areas, seeking to turn them back to general public land management and increase access by sportsmen. 
But conservation organizations say the move would lead to a slippery slope that could strip protections from roughly a million acres of key wildlife habitat and recreational lands. 
The Montana Sportsmen Conservation Act, which Daines originally introduced in 2022, would remove WSA designations from three areas in Montana — the Middle Fork Judith, Hoodoo Mountain, and Wales Creek Wilderness Study Areas. 
Middle Fork Judith WSA is approximately 81,000 acres and located on the Lewis and Clark National Forest across the Little Belt Mountains southeast of Great Falls.
The Hoodoo Mountain and Wales Creek WSAs each comprise just over 11,000 acres of BLM land near Ovando and Lincoln.
They are part of 44 sections of public land designated under two federal acts. 
Montana’s WSAs on U.S. Forest Service land stem from a 1977 bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. Lee Metcalf, a Montana Democrat, who set aside nine landscapes totaling more than 700,000 acres to protect until Congress could officially determine whether to designate them as wilderness. 
In 1976, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act instructed the BLM to inventory and assess its lands and in 2000, an Interior Secretarial order set aside 38 WSAs on BLM land in Montana for evaluation. 
Both federal acts had timelines for land management agencies to make a determination over whether to incorporate the WSAs into federal Wilderness. While a majority of WSAs didn’t make the cut, no federal action was taken to reclassify them. 
More recently, the Forest Service determined in 2021 that the Middle Fork Judith WSA is “unsuitable for inclusion in the Wilderness Preservation System,” according to Daines’ bill, while the BLM made the same recommendation for Hoodoo Mountain and Wales Creek in 2020.
“As a lifelong sportsman, increasing access to Montana’s great outdoors is one of my top priorities,” Daines said in a statement. “The ‘Montana Sportsmen Conservation Act’ promotes our outdoor way of life by returning restrictive WSA’s to general public land management, which will improve wildlife habitat restoration, reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, and unlock better access to public lands.”
Wilderness Study Areas are managed as de facto wilderness, but with some key differences. 
Motorized and mechanized recreation, including snowmobiling and biking, are prohibited in wilderness areas, but are allowed in some WSAs along existing roads. 
According to a 2020 report to the Montana Environmental Quality Council, Middle Fork Judith allows winter and nonwinter motorized access along with mountain biking.
Another big management difference is resource extraction.
On BLM land, logging is permitted, while some logging can be allowed on Forest Service land with extensive public input. Removing WSA designations could bolster management agencies’ ability to greenlight logging to thin old and dense timber, which proponents say is key to helping prevent wildfires and bolster economic activity. 
Opponents to Daines’ legislation include many conservation groups that say a top-down decision made in Congress leaves out voices on the ground. 
“Montanans want a seat at the table in shaping the future of our public lands. This deeply flawed bill is not locally driven or balanced,” Montana state director of The Wilderness Society Barb Cestero said in a statement. “Instead, it represents the kind of top-down, one-size-fits-all approach Montanans have consistently rejected. We invite Senator Daines to join the many Montanans who are rolling up their sleeves to develop local, collaborative and balanced solutions for these public lands so that our kids and grandkids can enjoy the same freedom to explore wild places as we do today.”
The debate over Wilderness Study Areas has been ongoing for decades, and routinely arises within the state legislature as well. 
During the 2025 Legislature, Republican Sen. Tony Tezak of Ennis introduced a joint resolution urging Congress to release all of Montana’s 44 WSAs. The bill, Senate Resolution 14, died in committee on a bipartisan vote. 
“Sen. Daines knows this approach has been rejected — by Montanans, by conservation groups, and by lawmakers from both parties — and he chose to bring it back anyway,” Ben Super, executive director of the Montana Conservation Voters Education Fund, said in a statement. “That’s not leadership. It’s a deliberate decision to override local voices and weaken safeguards for irreplaceable public lands without public support or a credible alternative.”
But the federal delegation has its own coalition of broad supporters as well, ranging from local government officials to outdoor groups and even Republican Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, who sponsored bills while in Congress to remove WSA designations. A spokesperson from the Governor’s Office did not immediately respond to a question about his support for the federal legislation. 
The Judith Basin and Powell county commissioners signed letters of support for the legislation, as did Montana Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife, the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association, Montana Farm Bureau Federation and the Great Falls Bicycle Club. 
If Hoodoo Mountain and Wales Creek changed designations, “both would retain critical wildlife habitat protections while providing the land management agencies the flexibility to do needed work to manage and improve habitat,” Jeff Darrah, executive director of Montana Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife wrote in a letter. A different designation “would help support wildlife-dependent recreation and hunting opportunities, and facilitate the long-term viability of big game wildlife populations.”
Montana’s U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy is listed as a co-sponsor to Daines’ bill, while U.S. Rep. Troy Downing is leading the companion effort in the House. 
“Land management must be fit for purpose, and the science shows that the Hoodoo Mountain, Wales Creek, and Middle Fork Judith Wilderness Study Areas would be better served without their WSA designations,” Downing said in a statement. “I’m proud to lead the effort in the House to return these lands to general management, unlocking public access and breaking down barriers preventing effective stewardship.”
Montana’s western U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke did not release a statement of support with the rest of the federal delegation, but Daines said he was looking forward to working with Zinke to get the bill passed. Zinke did not respond to a question about supporting the bill by publication time.
Zinke was a former Interior Secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, and under his tenure the BLM supported releasing WSAs.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20211002_1646142-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-12-23 15:58:21.778403

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch),"The Iowa Utilities Commission listened to public comments at its monthly public meeting Wednesday from landowners opposed to a carbon sequestration pipeline. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Utilities Commission will have to decide whether Summit Carbon Solutions can change the ending destination for its carbon sequestration pipeline before a case against the company’s permit can proceed, an Iowa court ruled. 
The Iowa District Court for Polk County ruled in favor of Summit’s motion to pause the case that landowners, counties and the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter filed in 2024. 
Opponents of the proposed carbon capture pipeline sued over the IUC decision to issue a conditional permit to Summit in June 2024. The permit allowed the company to use eminent domain to build a pipeline that would connect to biorefineries across the state and transport carbon dioxide to North Dakota for underground storage.

Per the IUC permit decision, Summit was required to obtain permission for its pipeline in North Dakota and South Dakota before it could begin construction in Iowa. 
Since the permit was issued, however, South Dakota enacted a law prohibiting the use of eminent domain for CO2 pipelines, which complicated Summit’s plans to transport the captured CO2 to an underground storage site in North Dakota. Eminent domain forces unwilling property owners to accept easements on their land for projects considered in the public interest, for payment determined by a county commission.
In light of these developments along with ongoing legal battles in North Dakota, Summit filed for an amendment to its permit with the IUC in September 2025 to remove the requirement that the company receive approval from the Dakotas. Instead of specifying a state, Summit asked for the permit to prohibit construction until the company has “secured access to one or more sequestration sites and permits or agreements to allow it to reach such storage.” 
Summit also requested the court stop proceedings on the lawsuit pertaining to the original permit until the IUC rules on the newly filed amendment. Polk County District Court Judge Scott Beattie sided with the company and remanded the case back to the IUC. 
In the decision Beattie, wrote that the South Dakota ban is “influential” to the decision. 
“Not only does the S.D. CO2 pipeline ban render the IUC’s Final Order void, but it also requires Summit to reroute its pipeline in order to get to North Dakota without going through South Dakota,” the decision said. 
During oral arguments, opponents said Summit’s requested permit amendment did not change the basis of their argument that Summit did not meet the definition of a common carrier and should not be granted eminent domain capabilities.  
The groups also argued, as described in Beattie’s decision, that it was unfair to pause judicial review based on “the mere possibility that a permit might be amended.”
Beattie wrote, however, that a pause in judicial proceedings while the permit amendment is evaluated is “warranted” as the court would otherwise be evaluating “outdated” facts. 
“Adjudicating the merits of a permit that is actively being amended serves no useful purpose,” the decision reads.
Emma Schmit, an organizing director with the pipeline fighter group Bold Alliance, said in a statement the ruling did “not come as a surprise.”
“After years of working to protect property rights from hazardous carbon pipelines, we know not every judge, regulator, or legislator will stand by us the first time around,” Schmit said in the statement. “But, we know the people of Iowa stand with us. So, we’ll continue to explore property rights protections through every possible avenue, including through the courts, the Iowa Utilities Commission, and the legislature.” 
Summit Carbon Solutions did not respond to a request for comment on the decision.

Sponsors of the ballot measure have one year to submit 31,164 signatures of qualified North Dakota electors to the secretary of state to be considered for the ballot, according to Howe’s office.
If the signatures are submitted by July 6, and are validated, the measure will appear on the general election ballot Nov. 3. 
Robin Nelson, chair of the ballot measure sponsoring committee, said the committee hopes to have the measure be decided on that November ballot.
“It’s go time,” Nelson said on Tuesday. “Once we get everything printed, we’ll start collecting signatures in early January.”
North Dakota lawmakers weigh impact of free school meal proposal

The organization, Together for School Meals, is heading up the informational campaign for the ballot measure, she said.
The ballot measure would require public schools to provide free breakfast and lunch to students. Private schools, Bureau of Indian Education schools and other tribal schools could opt in to participate in the program.
During a recent legislative committee meeting, Lynelle Johnson, director of child nutrition and food distribution for the Department of Public Instruction, told lawmakers the estimated cost to provide free school meals for the 2027-29 biennium is $134 million. She also said the figure is preliminary and may change as she continues to evaluate the measure.
The measure says if the Legislature is unable to identify funding, the dollars should come from the earnings of the state Legacy Fund.

(Photo by James Brooks / Alaska Beacon)It’s the season of warm wishes, goodwill, families and friends. It’s a time for sharing old memories and making new memories with the new year. It’s a break in everyday life to remember the past and think about the future.
Too bad Alaskans need to be thinking about how the state will come up with enough money in 2026 to fully fund schools, highway projects, the ferry system, public services, repairs to aging facilities — and a politically acceptable Permanent Fund dividend that will help pay for residents’ holiday presents next year.
Santa carries a lot of weight, literally and figuratively, but the jolly guy can’t do anything to gift the state higher oil prices. Yet that’s exactly what the Alaska treasury needs under its Christmas tree this week.
Though oil revenues ain’t what they used to be when Alaska’s North Slope was putting 2 million barrels a day into the pipeline at its peak in 1988, this year’s average of almost 460,000 barrels a day still is expected to provide about one-quarter of the treasury’s general-purpose revenues, more than $1.4 billion.
But that is a forecast number, dependent on the price of oil — which is down. North Slope crude has dropped from $80 a barrel on Jan. 15 to just under $61 on Dec. 18. This year’s budget about breaks even at an average price of just over $65.
The difference between $60 and $65 oil equals about $150 million less for the treasury over a full year, which is lot of money when legislators — and the public — think about what they want to see in the next state budget.
It’s not like Santa has anything against Alaska, and there’s nothing the state can do about oil prices. North Slope oil is worth whatever the market will pay, and right now the market is flush with oil. So much so that at last count more than 1.3 billion barrels of crude was at sea, parked off to the side of sea lanes or aboard tankers moving real slow in hopes of finding buyers or at least better prices.
That 1.3 billion barrels at sea is the highest number since the worst of the pandemic shutdowns in April 2020.
It’s not looking to get better for sellers anytime soon. The International Energy Agency forecasts oil producers will be pumping 3.8 million barrels a day more than the world needs next year, at least until companies scale back their production or economic growth and demand get stronger.
All that oil is coming from seemingly everywhere. From OPEC+ producers, which spent most of this year boosting production to win back market share; from the U.S., which set a record this year for oil production; Canada, also a new record holder; from the South American nation of Guyana, which reached almost 1 million barrels a day, a sixfold increase since 2021; and Brazil, which broke 5 million barrels a day this year, a record.
Producers planned all the new oil years ago, looking at higher prices and planning on rising demand. But the best laid plans of mice and men and oil company executives don’t always turn out as expected.
“What I can say with absolute certainty is this: An excess of oil affects the country and affects prices,” Angola’s Minister of Mineral Resources Diamantino Pedro was quoted by Bloomberg news service last week. Angola pumps more than a million barrels a day. “This country depends heavily on oil — I don’t say that with pleasure, but it’s the reality.”
He could have said the same thing about Alaska.
Too bad Santa’s sleigh doesn’t run on diesel. Anything to boost demand for oil, and prices.

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders released another $100,000 Tuesday to go toward the response to floods, storms and tornadoes that hit the state in April.
Sanders signed an executive order authorizing the release of money from the Governor’s Disaster Response and Recovery Fund. 
The money will be used to defray the administrative and program costs of the storms’ response and will be used at the discretion of the state emergency management director, according to the order.
The early April severe weather was part of a deadly storm pattern that hit the Central Mississippi River Valley region and brought historic rainfall. Heavy rains hit northeast Arkansas during the weather pattern. 
A report from an international coalition of climate researchers said the “generational” storms were made 40% more likely because of the warming climate.

Free.,Trump appears in several files of latest Epstein release,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-appears-several-files-latest-epstein-release,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Justice early Tuesday released thousands more files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with several referencing President Donald Trump. The latest trove — which features nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Epstein — includes a note referring to Trump that Epstein appears to have sent the same month he died by suicide in a New York City jail cell and an email from a prosecutor claiming Trump flew on Epstein’s private jet more times than previously reported. (edited)In a social media post announcing the Tuesday release, the department issued a blanket denial that Trump was involved in Epstein’s crimes, saying the evidence included in the files were discredited.“Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the post said.The agency added “the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”The department has faced backlash for its piecemeal rollout of the files beginning Dec. 19, despite a legal mandate to release the full set on that date. Trump had a well-documented friendship with Epstein, but has maintained he had a falling out with the disgraced financier and was never involved in any alleged crimes. Flight records, letter to Nassar A 2020 email from an assistant U.S. attorney in New York says flight records indicate that Trump “traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than previously has been reported.” The email notes that Trump was “listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996” and that this includes “at least four flights” on which Epstein’s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell “was also present.” The files also include a letter Epstein purportedly sent to convicted serial sex offender Larry Nassar in 2019. “We shared one thing ... our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential,” Epstein allegedly wrote to Nassar, a disgraced former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor. “Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls,” Epstein appears to have continued. Trump was president at the time. “When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system,” Epstein purportedly wrote. “Life is unfair.”The letter was postmarked Aug. 13, 2019, just three days after Epstein died in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. The Justice Department said in a social media post Tuesday afternoon it was “currently looking into the validity of this alleged letter from Jeffrey Epstein to Larry Nassar and we will follow up as soon as possible,” pointing to multiple discrepancies.Another email in the Tuesday release references more potential co-conspirators, according to U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.Schumer called on the Justice Department to release more information on a note he said indicates the DOJ “was looking into at least ten potential Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirators.”  The New York Democrat said the department “needs to shed more light on who was on the list, how they were involved, and why they chose not to prosecute.” He added: “Protecting possible co-conspirators is not the transparency the American people and Congress are demanding.”DOJ takes heat The Justice Department has faced heat for opting to release the files in batches instead of adhering to the congressionally mandated full release of the files by mid-December. The requirement comes from a bill Trump signed into law in November, which requires the agency to make publicly available “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in DOJ’s possession that relate to the investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein,” including materials related to Maxwell.The measure — co-sponsored by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California — gave the department 30 days after the bill was enacted into law to release the files, or Dec. 19.",,,,2025-12-23 14:12:36.609804

(Courtesy Michele Williams)Threatened cuts to federal homelessness funding next year will have ripple effects across a state overwhelmed with a rising unhoused population, including at an emergency shelter in Santa Fe that already has a long wait list, according to the shelter’s head.
Consuelo’s Place Executive Director Michele Williams told Source NM that she expects the wait list at her shelter to at least double if the federal Housing and Urban Development agency carries out plans to drastically cut its main anti-homelessness program known as Continuum of Care. 
NM homelessness coalition will ask Legislature to fill in federal funding gaps

HUD first announced that possibility in mid-November when it released an unexpected “Notice of Funding Opportunity” for the Continuum of Care program that suggested it was seeking to slash funding by 70%, including major cuts to “permanent supportive housing,” which is long-term housing for formerly unhoused people who also receive services for mental illness or drug addiction.
HUD removed the notice in early December, potentially in response to a pair of lawsuits, but Williams and other nonprofit directors say they are heading into the new year with increasing uncertainty about the program that usually provides the state about $14 million a year. The state received $17 million in the latest funding round.
Williams is anxious about the Continuum of Care cuts even though her shelter doesn’t receive any of its funding, she told Source, because she relies on organizations that do, including nonprofits that place people in permanent supportive housing after staying in emergency shelters like Consuelo’s Place. The shelter currently has a waitlist of between 30 and 40 individuals and families for a shelter that usually houses between 60 and 90 families a year, she said. 
“It is one of the financial mechanisms that support how our clients leave emergency shelter and go into housing,” she said. “So if they are cut, clients will be stuck in shelter; families will be stuck in shelter; seniors will be stuck in shelter; in our shelter and certainly around the state and probably around the country.”
Rural, unhoused people statewide cite deposit, application fees as greatest barrier to housing

People being stuck for longer in her shelter will mean the wait list will grow longer, she said. Meanwhile, cutting funds for permanent housing will result in more people ending up living on the streets, she said. Those people will also end up on her wait list, she predicted.
“There may be some people that are housed in their programs that will become unhoused if they lose their funding, so that also may be where the need will increase to our shelter,” she said.
Unsheltered homelessness in Santa Fe increased over the course of the year, as well as the rest of the state, according to results of a recent Point-in-Time Count. 
Monet Silva, director of the New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness, which coordinates Continuum of Care funding applications from nonprofits across the state, previously told Source New Mexico she is hoping the Legislature will pay for the expected HUD funding cuts during the upcoming legislative session.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s proposed budget released Monday contains more than $110 million for housing, including $45 million for “homelessness initiatives,” though it’s unclear from the budget proposal how much of that funding is intended to offset Continuum of Care funding cuts. The Legislature will meet in January with its own funding priorities to approve the budget.  
The threat of HUD cuts capped off a year at Consuelo’s Place marked by federal cuts to programs on which her clients rely, including the abrupt halt of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during a federal government shutdown. During that period, Williams said  she was heartened to see community members increase food donations, as well as the state spending $30 million of its own funding to pay for partial November SNAP benefits. 
As she gears up to celebrate Christmas, with the help of a donated tree and donated gifts for children in her care, Williams said she is optimistic that the state and the community she lives in will show up again to help her clients even if the HUD cuts happen.
“I think it’s all we can do,” she said. “We have strong local leaders. I look forward to working with them and feel comfortable about the community that is Santa Fe and how we are going to support one another in the short term as this hopefully gets resolved on the national level.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/JPEG-image-4D86-9C73-EC-0-e1766443430256-1024x937.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 14:12:36.609804

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers is ending his lawsuit against the Omaha Public Power District, for now, after the public utility board delayed plans to modify power production in North Omaha until 2028.
Hilgers, on Tuesday, announced his office would voluntarily dismiss his lawsuit filed Oct. 9, but that it could be brought again “if circumstances change.” The OPPD board on Dec. 18 voted 6-2 for a resolution that puts off plans to “modernize” North Omaha Station and end coal production at the site until at least 2028, rather than 2026. OPPD Directors Eric Williams and Sara Howard opposed the resolution.

OPPD’s vote introduced new requirements before the North Omaha transition could occur. In a separate vote, OPPD approved average rate increases of 6.3%, effective Jan. 1. Williams and Howard also opposed the increase.
“We brought this lawsuit because public power providers should not achieve their self-imposed environmental goals by raising prices for Nebraska consumers,” Hilgers said in a Tuesday statement. “After last week’s vote, OPPD’s plans for the North Omaha Station now align with their twin mandates of affordability and reliability in delivering electricity to Nebraskans.”
Craig Moody, an OPPD member who voted in favor of the Dec. 18 resolution, said in a recent social media post that whether board directors supported or opposed the resolution would have still delayed changes at North Omaha Station until the end of 2028, if not later. 
Moody said voting in favor of the resolution locked in a “clear and transparent timeline” and that voting could have furthered Hilgers’ lawsuit. Moody said OPPD staff recommended indefinitely extending coal burning, which he described as a “no-go proposition.”
“The closure was already delayed by two years,” Moody wrote Dec. 20 on Facebook. “No matter which way the board voted, the timelines were the same and … we do not know what, if any, grid improvements are necessary in order to move forward.”
Nebraska is the only state with exclusively publicly owned utilities providing power.
OPPD serves about 1 million Nebraskans across 13 eastern Nebraska counties, including much of the Omaha area. OPPD had no immediate comment on Hilgers’ dismissal.

Hilgers had accused OPPD of drifting from state law he says requires public power providers to prioritize affordability and reliability above all else, such as “environmental justice.” The lawsuit also challenged OPPD’s greener-energy goal of “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, which the board adopted in 2019.
Ten state senators from Omaha, Lincoln and Bellevue sparred with Hilgers over the lawsuit. They argued energy rates would increase regardless of how the North Omaha Station produces electricity.
“This lawsuit sends a chilling message to every Nebraskan fighting for healthy communities that when a community finally compels action from public institutions, the state’s top lawyer may step in to stop it,” the letter said.
OPPD first pledged to “modernize” North Omaha Station and its five power-producing units in 2014. The plan has been to retire three natural gas units built in the 1950s, which switched from coal in 2016, and transition two 1960s-era coal units to natural gas. 
OPPD also delayed moving forward with the plan in 2022, pushing it then to 2026.
“The new schedule outlined in the resolution is the fastest, most responsible path forward to the refueling and retirement of NOS [North Omaha Station],” OPPD President and CEO Javier Fernandez said last week. “We will continue to work closely with SPP [Southwest Power Pool] and other stakeholders to enable a responsible transition while maintaining service for our customers.” 
North Omaha residents have fought to get OPPD to modify the plant near the local neighborhood, citing health concerns. Douglas County Health Director Lindsay Huse had also urged OPPD to stay the course. 
Hilgers, OPPD and Gov. Jim Pillen have repeatedly challenged those concerns. Pillen last week praised OPPD’s delay and said it showed “common sense — and hard science — prevailed.”

DemasThis story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Dozens of Michigan school districts and officials are appealing a judge’s ruling that upholds state budget language putting conditions on the distribution of funding for school safety and mental health.
The lawsuit stemmed from a new rule in the budget stating that in order to receive that funding from the state, districts must agree to waive privilege, which means they must disclose information that would otherwise be legally protected if there is a mass casualty event. Districts must also agree to a comprehensive investigation of such an event.
Judge Sima Patel granted the state’s motion for a summary disposition, essentially ending the case in the Michigan Court of Claims. But the plaintiffs are appealing Patel’s ruling to the Michigan Court of Appeals.
Patel, who listened to oral arguments during a hearing earlier this month, issued her ruling Dec. 17 rejecting the plaintiffs’ arguments. Here is what she had to say about two of the key claims in the school districts’ lawsuit.
 Districts claimed budget language violates Michigan Constitution

The budget says that to receive the $321 million in safety and mental health funds, districts “must agree to be subject to a comprehensive investigation, must affirmatively agree to waive any privilege that may otherwise protect information from disclosure in the event of a mass casualty event, and must agree to comply with a comprehensive investigation.”
A mass casualty event is defined in the state budget in part as an incident “resulting in significant injuries to not fewer than 3 individuals” or an incident resulting in fatalities.
But the plaintiffs’ attorney, Scott Eldridge, argued in court that some of the budget language violates the Michigan Constitution because it is “exceedingly vague.” Specifically, Eldridge said the “waive any privilege” language is overly broad. He also said the definitions of a mass casualty event are too broad and vague.
“Vagueness means it’s limitless and unbound because it gives zero guideposts or direction as to what’s legal versus what’s illegal conduct,” Eldridge said.
Eldridge urged Patel to “use a scalpel instead of a machete” and declare those phrases unconstitutional.
But Patel noted in her ruling that the plaintiffs faced an “extremely steep hurdle” in proving those claims.
The “waive any privilege,” language, she said, “is clear and not vague,” and means what it says.
“Any and all privileges that may otherwise protect information from disclosure by the district are included,” Patel said in the ruling. “The breadth of the phrase does not render it ambiguous.”
At the hearing earlier this month, Eldridge questioned whether incidents like a bus accident on the way to school, concussions on a football field, a fight in the stands of an athletic event, food poisoning in the cafeteria, or a gas leak would be considered a mass casualty event.
“A significant injury is one that is severe enough to be noticed and have an effect on the injured person,” Patel responded in her ruling. She also said that the budget’s definition of a mass casualty event “may be broad, but it is understandable.”
Districts had until Dec. 4 to agree to waive their privilege. They have until Dec. 30 to rescind that agreement. The plaintiffs sought to extend that deadline to rescind even longer, asking Patel that if she rules against them in the lawsuit, that she set that deadline to 30 days after the appeals process is resolved. Patel said no in her ruling.
“There is no way for this Court or the interested parties to know how long the appellate process will take,” Patel said. “The distribution of funds cannot be delayed that long.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s Republican attorney general asked a judge Tuesday for a court order to stop an abortion-rights ad campaign.
The request in Hughes County court comes after Attorney General Marty Jackley issued a cease-and-desist to Mayday Health, a New York-based nonprofit. The organization, which did not comply with the cease-and-desist, is running a gas-station advertising campaign that provides links to information about abortion pills with the tagline “Pregnant? Don’t want to be?”
Mayday Health is dedicated to educating people about the safety and effectiveness of abortion pills. The organization did not grant South Dakota Searchlight an interview, but referred to an Instagram post from Executive Director Liv Raisner.
In the post, Raisner said the advertisements are constitutionally protected. Mayday Health provides links to information, but does not sell abortion pills directly from its website.
“We’re not taking the signs down,” Raisner said in the Instagram post. “It’s First Amendment-protected free speech, and information is not illegal.”

South Dakota lawmakers adopted an abortion trigger ban in 2005 that took effect in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Abortions are prohibited in the state, unless the mother’s life is threatened by a pregnancy. State lawmakers also passed legislation in 2022 banning “medical abortion by telemedicine.”
Jackley said the Mayday Health advertisements are illegally deceptive because the website leads consumers to believe that elective abortions and receiving abortion pills by mail are legal in the state. He also alleged that the ads are dangerous.
“These ads are targeting women — including teenagers — encouraging them to take these pills while misleading them about the potential physical risks,” Jackley said in a news release. “At the same time, they promote secrecy by urging women not to inform their doctors and children not to tell their parents.”
The campaign of gas-pump placards was set to launch at 30 gas stations around South Dakota on Dec. 8 and stay up for six weeks, according to Mayday. There were 14 locations that had the advertisements up as of Dec. 10, as confirmed by Mayday.
Several gas station owners have removed the advertisements voluntarily, according to the Attorney General’s Office. The attorney general’s lawsuit says only two locations still have the gas-station advertisements, in Brookings and Vermillion.
In its original news release, Mayday pledged a digital advertising campaign alongside the gas station ads. The group didn’t specify how the digital ads would appear, but said they would include “real people in South Dakota sharing their perspectives on what it’s like to live in a state with an abortion ban.”
In 2023, medication abortions accounted for 63% of abortions in the country, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute. The drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, commonly used in medication abortions, are also listed on the World Health Organizations’ list of essential medicines. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an attempt by anti-abortion medical organizations to overturn the Food and Drug Administration’s prescribing guidelines for mifepristone.
There is no date scheduled yet for a hearing on South Dakota’s lawsuit. The state lists an advertising company, Minnesota-based AllOver Media, doing business as Momentara, as a defendant alongside Mayday.

Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected the General Assembly’s actions all but twice (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Missouri is trying to illegally enact a gerrymandered congressional map in violation of a century of constitutional precedent, a lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges. 
The ACLU of Missouri filed the lawsuit in Cole County on behalf of two Jackson County residents against Attorney General Catherine Hanaway and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins. At the heart of the litigation is the state’s decision to allow the congressional map approved by lawmakers in September to take effect despite a referendum campaign turning in 305,000 signatures to place it on the ballot. 
The decision runs contrary to how the process has worked for more than 100 years, said Tori Schafer, director of policy and campaigns at the ACLU of Missouri.
In a statement released before the lawsuit was filed, Hanaway defended the move, saying the map will only be suspended if and when Hoskins verifies enough signatures have been submitted — a process that could take until July. 
“Our office will continue to defend the Constitution and ensure that Missouri’s laws are strictly adhered to during this process,” Hanaway said.
Missouri set to enact gerrymandered map despite 300K signatures for repeal referendum

If the map is allowed to go into effect, county clerks and local election boards will be asked to update voter rolls to show which district includes each voter. And it means the new map would be used for candidate filing that begins in February.
By the time signatures are verified in July, it would be too late to change the ballot for the August 2026 primaries. 
“Given that the filing period for congressional candidates begins on Feb. 24, 2026, this is a transparent ploy to force the use of (the) new congressional map by delaying certification of the referendum’s signatures until it is too late to change the congressional map for the 2026 midterms,” the lawsuit states. 
Historically, when a referendum campaign has submitted signatures to put a law on the ballot, that law has been immediately suspended pending a vote of the people. 
That’s what happened in 2017, when then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft suspended a right-to-work law after a coalition of labor unions submitted 300,000 signatures. The law never ended up going into effect because it was defeated by voters a year later. 
But the precedent goes back much further. 
In 1914, the Missouri Supreme Court held that once citizens submit signatures, the challenged law is automatically suspended until voters decide its fate. The court warned that allowing a law to take effect while under referendum would gut the people’s constitutional power and turn the process into a sham.
Half a century later, the court explicitly said the purpose of a referendum is to suspend or annul a law before it has gone into effect. Allowing a law to take effect and then later be suspended, the court warned, would invite instability and confusion.
Prior to 2017, the last time the referendum was deployed was 1982. Then-Secretary of State James Kirkpatrick put a new trucking law on hold after signatures were submitted for a referendum. A lawsuit demanding immediate implementation was dismissed, and the law was repealed by voters.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Referendum-security-20251209-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 12:59:01.509255

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)State officials have denied a request from Smitty’s Supply Inc. to dispose of wastewater and stormwater from its disaster cleanup into drainage ditches that lead to the Tangipahoa River. 
The company submitted a short-term emergency general permit request Dec. 3 to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality asking for its permission to discharge up to 200,000 gallons of contaminated water per day for two months into the local drainage system. Over the two-month period, it would have allowed Smitty’s Supply to get rid of as much as 12 million gallons of potentially harmful stormwater that has pooled at the site and mixed with oil and chemicals. 
That would be nearly double the amount of waste materials and fluids authorities have already recovered from the surrounding environment since the Smitty Supply’s petroleum products facility in Roseland was destroyed in an Aug. 22 fire and explosion. The fire that burned for two weeks decimated the 20-acre facility, causing several large oil tanks to explode and spread pollutants for miles across Tangipahoa Parish. 
The Department of Environmental Quality denied the Smitty’s Supply permit request Dec. 5, with records pointing out the collected stormwater was still too contaminated despite it being run through a commercial filtration and treatment process.    
The company has been exploring multiple disposal options for various wastes accumulating at the site, including stormwater and washwater contaminated with various oils, solvents and chemicals strewn into the air, surrounding land and waterways during and after the August disaster. 
In an email Tuesday to the Illuminator, a Smitty’s Supply spokesperson said the company is grateful for community support, remains focused on cleanup operations and remains dedicated to supplying products that “keep industries operating and communities moving.”
“The company has replaced personal property lost during the fire, cleaned homes, vehicles, and yards, and helped former employees connect with new job opportunities through local career fairs — continuing to invest in the well-being of its neighbors as remediation progresses,” the statement read. “Smitty’s Supply will continue working closely with state and federal agencies to ensure the cleanup remains comprehensive, safe, and transparent for the community.”
After leading the initial recovery of spilled materials from surrounding land and water bodies, the state Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have largely removed their personnel and equipment from the area. On Dec. 8, Smitty’s Supply took over cleanup operations at its facility site with continued monitoring from state and federal officials.
The company has recovered an unspecified volume of contaminated stormwater mixed with ash, residues and chemicals. It has settled into various sumps and containment areas at the site, according to reports EPA officials compiled and filed with the state. 
In their statement, Smitty’s Supply said cleanup teams this month have processed liquids from modular storage tanks, transported ash and excavated soil for proper disposal, vacuumed oil and other residues, and continued equipment decontamination. Demolition of steel structures remains on track for completion by the end of 2025, with full cleaning of paved areas expected by the end of January, the email stated.
“To date, the company has removed 2,644 tons of debris and recycled 3,725 tons of scrap metal from the site, reflecting measurable progress in safely reducing impacts and preparing the facility for further remediation steps,” the statement read, in part.
After crews collected the stormwater in temporary storage tanks, Smitty’s Supply hired a business to treat and filter the wastewater in an effort to make it clean enough to return to the environment, records show. 
However, when Smitty’s Supply had it tested, the recovered water was still too contaminated to be discharged, records show. The Department of Environmental Quality rejected the company’s permit application, noting lab reports showed pollution was “above the permissible limits” contained within the emergency general permit rules.
The recent lab results indicated elevated levels of organic waste, carbon and dissolved solids. The organic waste was particularly high, at more than five times the maximum threshold allowed under state regulations. Ethanol was also present in the sampled water at 25 parts per million, though the state didn’t mention this in its denial letter.  
Smitty’s Supply also wants permission to discharge water contaminated during cleanup operations at the facility. Cleanup crews have been using the local water supply to pressure wash concrete slabs at the facility, creating another stream of wastewater in addition to the rainfall. When the company included this in its Dec. 3 notice to the Department of Environmental Quality, it didn’t clarify whether the 200,000 gallons per day rate applied to wash water, stormwater or both. The agency seemed surprised by the company’s request. 
In a phone interview last week, LDEQ spokesman Greg Langley said the agency was initially unaware that Smitty’s Supply had plans to discharge its wash water along with the stormwater.
“[In] initial discussions with Smitty’s Supply, Inc., it was this Office’s understanding that the proposed … clean up discharges consisted only of contaminated stormwater collected from within the bermed areas of the site,” the agency’s denial letter states. 
Dozens of oil-covered animals recovered from Smitty’s Supply disaster

Smitty’s Supply indicated in its notice that it plans to adjust the stormwater treatment process and retest the effluent, though it’s unclear when those lab results will be released. As of Friday, they were not yet publicly available, and the Department of Environmental Quality confirmed it had still not granted the company any emergency permits.
The state can approve the discharge of stormwater and water used to clean pavement and buildings, but the Department of Environmental Quality can deny a permit if a facility has “previously been in violation of state water quality regulations” or it is in an “environmentally sensitive area.”
In its denial letter, the agency told Smitty’s Supply it might need a more permanent discharge permit in order to move forward with its planned discharges.
Some neighbors of the facility are urging state officials not to grant the company permission to release its wastewater into the drainage system. As of Monday, six residents filed written objections with the state to the company’s permit application even though the matter is not open for public comment. 
“That’s one of the problems,” Matthew Allen said in a phone interview. “They file under a general permit so the public doesn’t hear about it and get to comment on it.”
Allen, a retired science teacher who lives in Folsom, started the environmental nonprofit Northshore Riverwatch about three years ago to protect the rivers that run through the parishes north of Lake Pontchartrain.
“Relying on the Tangipahoa River as a de facto disposal mechanism to ‘carry away’ hazardous compounds is fundamentally incompatible with the purpose, scope and legal constraints of a general permit,” Allen wrote in his objection letter. 
Other residents have been surveilling the Smitty’s Supply facility, taking photos and videos of nearby public ditches containing discolored water and then posting them on social media. The posts typically draw criticisms of the company and government agencies, and they often raise questions about what health and environmental problems might persist. 
“Everybody’s just scared to death,” Allen said. “They don’t know what they’ve been exposed to, so everything’s just a big reaction.”
Some residents are collecting their own water, soil and material samples for lab analysis. 
Evan Wooten, who lives on a small farm within a half-mile of the Smitty’s facility, said he found several shards of mangled metal on his land that appeared to come from an exploded storage tank. A basic metals analysis showed the shards to be mostly iron, he said in a phone interview. 
Wooten said his goats were eating leaves and vegetation on his property that were contaminated with black oily residue, so he relocated them to a different farm. Two ultimately died, though he believes they contracted a parasite from the other farm, he said.   
Wooten said he wants to test some of his other animals for chemical toxins, but he can’t find any local veterinarians willing or able to do it, he said.
“They don’t want to get involved,” Wooten said. “We’re not getting any real help from anybody.”

(Photo by Getty Images)Senate lawmakers approved legislation that would expand family leave and temporary disability benefits to workers at smaller companies in a party-line vote Monday.
The legislation, approved in a 24-12 vote, would allow workers at firms with as few as 15 employees to take job-protected paid family leave.
“This bill would ensure that the vast majority of New Jersey workers are entitled to family leave protections, whether they work for a huge corporation or a small business,” said bill sponsor Sen. Paul Moriarty (D-Gloucester).
NJ lawmakers cancel votes on bill to ban pet stores from selling dogs, cats

Existing New Jersey law permits workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid family leave to bond with new children or care for a sick or injured loved one. Workers on family leave can earn up to 85% of their weekly pay, to a cap of $1,081 per week in 2025, or $1,119 in 2026.
To be eligible under current law, an employee must have worked at a given employer for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,000 hours in the preceding 12 months.
The bill would halve both those qualifications, requiring workers to be with their employer for at least six months and cutting the hours requirement to 500.
“It’s time we close the gap and guarantee that those working at smaller businesses, which more frequently include low-wage, part-time, and caregiving workers, have the same protections as those working at larger companies,” said bill sponsor Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex).
The benefits are funded by a 0.28% payroll tax on worker income, to a wage cap of $138,200.
Existing law bars employers from retaliating against workers for using family leave benefits. Text added by the bill would clarify that workers are entitled to be restored to their previous position or one with equivalent pay, benefits, and seniority upon returning from family leave.
It would also explicitly allow workers to use family leave, temporary disability benefits, and earned sick leave in the order of their choosing.
Business groups had opposed the bill, warning that expanding family leave eligibility could make New Jersey small businesses less competitive.
Chris Emigholz, chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, in a letter to Senators last week noted only seven states offered job protections to workers at firms with as few as 15 employees.
“In other words, New Jersey would be placing its smallest employers into a narrow national category — an outlier beyond most states we directly compete with for jobs and investment,” he said in the letter.
The Assembly earlier this year approved a version of the bill that would extend the benefits to workers at businesses with as few as five employees.
 Intoxicating hemp ban

Lawmakers in both chambers on Monday approved in bipartisan votes legislation that would require retailers to phase out the sale of certain intoxicating hemp products ahead of new federal regulations that become effective next November.
The new regulations, approved as part of the spending bill that ended the federal government shutdown last month, would ban hemp products with a total THC concentration of more than 0.4%. THC is the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana.
The state measure, which awaits the governor’s signature, would allow New Jersey retailers to continue selling products that would be barred by the bill or federal regulations until April 13, 2026.
After that date, intoxicating hemp beverages would be limited to no more than 5 milligrams of THC per serving, or 10 milligrams per container, and other hemp products would be limited to a 0.3% THC concentration.
It would also impose a $3.75-per-gallon excise tax on the wholesale sale of intoxicating hemp beverages, effective April 13.
The movement comes more than a year after Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation that criminalized the sale of intoxicating hemp products to people below the age of 21.
“By acting now, we can close gaps in oversight, reduce confusion for businesses and regulators, and ensure these products are safe, transparent, and kept out of the hands of children, protecting New Jersey families and public health,” said bill sponsor Teresa Ruiz (D-Newark).

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota law that prevents drug companies from restricting federal drug discounts for hospitals and other providers will remain in effect for now, a judge has decided.
Chicago-based AbbVie Inc., whose products include the wrinkle-remover Botox and the arthritis drug Humira, sued the state earlier this year in the U.S. District Court of South Dakota. The lawsuit challenges the legality of Senate Bill 154, which lawmakers and Gov. Larry Rhoden approved in March. It blocks drugmakers from deciding which pharmacies hospitals can use to access discounted medication.
Judge Roberto Lange did not dismiss AbbVie’s case against the state of South Dakota, but declined to issue a preliminary injunction that would have barred the new law from taking effect while the case plays out. 
Drugmaker sues SD over law preserving broad access to discounts for hospitals, pharmacies

The dispute centers on a provision in federal law known as 340B, which requires drugmakers who want to participate in Medicare and Medicaid to give steep discounts to providers like hospitals or clinics that serve low-income patients. Those health care providers, in turn, mark up the cost of those discounted drugs to make up the difference between their operating costs and the low reimbursement rates the Medicare and Medicaid programs pay for medical care. 
Initially, only providers whose primary clientele were Medicare and Medicaid patients were eligible for the discounts, but the discounts were later extended to places dubbed “sole community providers,” such as hospitals serving rural areas. 
That dramatically expanded the number of providers who got the discounts, and spurred drug companies to limit the number of pharmacies from which hospitals and clinics could access the discounted drugs. 
The drug company argues in the South Dakota case that the state overstepped its authority by passing a law that regulates interstate commerce, in this instance commerce involving pharmaceuticals.
It also argues that the new state law interferes with a federal pilot program meant to address some of the issues surrounding 340B payments by offering rebates to program participants, rather than upfront discounts.
In his ruling this week, Judge Lange said the state law will not prevent the drug company from participating in the federal pilot program, and that questions surrounding interstate commerce can be sorted out as the case proceeds.

Before Robert Clark Jr. broke barriers as Mississippi’s first Black legislator since Reconstruction in 1968, he spent two decades in classrooms.
From 1953 to 1973 he taught in secondary and postsecondary schools across the state, cultivating a reputation as a principled educator before turning full-time to politics.
Clark often spoke of his ambition to lead the House Education Committee – a goal realized in 1977 when House Speaker C.B. “Buddie’ Newman appointed him after George Rogers left to join President Jimmy Carter’s administration.
But Clark’s early years in the Mississippi Legislature were marked not by influence, but by isolation.
He frequently stood as the lone dissenting vote on major legislation, a solitary figure challenging the prevailing political order. That isolation reached a defining moment in January 1970 as Mississippi braced for federally mandated school desegregation.
In his statewide address that month, Gov. John Bell Williams acknowledged the end of the segregated system but urged parents to embrace “freedom of choice” between public and private schools. His somber words reflected a region still resisting change.
The governor framed the proposal as empowering parents, but critics warned it masked efforts to preserve segregation through state-supported private academies.
Clark was blunt in his rebuttal. Williams’ plan, he argued, would “only weaken the already poor educational system we have in Mississippi” by funneling public dollars into private institutions.
On March 20, when the House overwhelmingly endorsed the governor’s proposal for freedom of choice, Clark cast the lone vote against it. “How

long are we in Mississippi going to keep on ignoring the mandates of the Constitution?” he asked, warning that the bill would only deepen public unrest.
His solitary stand highlighted the fault lines of an education system caught between progress and preservation.
In the early months of 1970, Clark was vocal in his criticism of both local and national leadership.
That January, President Richard Nixon’s domestic advisers floated the idea of forming a “blue ribbon Southern group” to address school desegregation.
Although Nixon publicly supported the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision to desegregate the public schools, calling it both constitutionally and morally correct, he remained careful not to interfere with ongoing court cases. His administration drew a strategic line: address only de jure segregation, dismiss de facto concerns.
“Call it de facto and drop it,” Nixon instructed his officials, aiming to avoid broader federal enforcement of integration policies.
While Nixon’s statements gave some Black leaders reason for cautious optimism, they did little to sway Clark. He continued to push for grassroots solutions to empower the Black community.
On Jan. 11, 1970,  Clark convened a coalition of civil rights and education leaders at the Mississippi Teachers Association office in Jackson. Representing organizations like the NAACP, the National Education Association and the Freedom Democratic Party, the group laid the groundwork for the Educational Resources Center (ERC). The initiative aimed to ensure Black Mississippians could engage in a unitary school system with “dignity and integrity,” contributing meaningfully to community education.
Still, legislative battles raged on. In early February, two measures aimed at bolstering private schools passed through the Mississippi House. One reduced licensing costs for private school buses. The other bill allowed individuals aged 16 and above to take out loans for private education. Clark condemned the bills as unconstitutional, calling them indirect tax subsidies that favored segregationist academies. He predicted they would not survive judicial scrutiny.
The tension escalated further when Williams vetoed $5 million in funding for four Head Start programs, affecting roughly 4,000 children.
Clark wrote directly to President Nixon, denouncing the move as racially charged and harmful to efforts at voluntary school integration. The veto, he argued, deepened distrust and discouraged white participation in the programs.
In a rare federal intervention, the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare responded to Clark’s appeal. On March 21, Secretary Robert Finch overrode the governor’s decision, approving over $2 million in grants to sustain the Head Start programs. The move highlighted the federal government’s growing role in supporting early childhood education in underserved communities.
As court-ordered integration took effect across the South, Mississippi saw a sharp rise in the establishment of private “segregation academies.” Many white families fled public schools, seeking what they framed as “quality” education. Clark remained a fierce critic of this exodus and the state’s continued financial support for private institutions, calling instead for full investment in public education.
A quarter-century later, the issue of school choice has returned to the forefront.
President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called school choice “the civil rights issue of our time,” secured a provision in his signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act creating the nation’s first federal school choice program.
The program, built on tax credit scholarships, allows taxpayers to donate up to $1,700 annually to nonprofits supporting private education, receiving a dollar-for-dollar credit in return. Unlike traditional deductions, which reduce taxable income, the program provides a full match – an unprecedented shift in education funding. In August 2025, Mississippi’s House Select Committee on Education Freedom heard testimony from two Trump administration officials, who argued the program could transform educational opportunities in the state.
Still, echoes of 1970 remain. Some lawmakers questioned whether school choice could erode public education or clash with constitutional provisions, just as Clark once argued decades earlier. Lindsey Burke, the Trump administration’s deputy chief of staff fo policy and programs, insisted the plan does not violate the Mississippi Constitution.
“The funds are not directly funding a school,” she said. “They are funding the family who then chooses a school.”
Mississippi once again finds itself at the center of debates over educational freedom.
The state has embraced modern versions of school choice—charter schools, vouchers, education savings accounts and open enrollment.
Supporters argue these programs empower parents and give children trapped in failing schools a way out. Critics warn they echo the old “freedom-of-choice” system, draining money from public schools and worsening racial and economic divides.
Legally, these programs are constitutional—for now. Courts have generally upheld vouchers and charters, even when public money flows to religious schools, as in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Carson v. Makin.
But Mississippi’s Constitution also requires lawmakers to maintain a system of free public schools. If funding shifts too heavily toward private or religious institutions, the state could face lawsuits challenging whether it is meeting that obligation.
The real test may not be in the courtroom, but in classrooms across Mississippi. If “choice” results in further segregation or starves public schools of resources, it risks repeating history – reviving the very inequalities the courts once declared unconstitutional.
In a press release regarding the establishment of a select committee, Mississippi House Speaker Jason White, a Republican from West, emphasized that “education freedom” will be the foremost priority as lawmakers prepare for the upcoming legislative session.
The committee met several more times in the following months to gather testimony from both supporters and critics. Lawmakers will use these findings to draft legislation for the 2026 session, ensuring the debate over who controls Mississipp’s classrooms—and how they receive funding—will continue to be unresolved.

The vigil comes after an extraordinary year of ICE presence in Connecticut and around the country as agents, often wearing masks, have detained residents everywhere from their places of work to courthouses. According to the organizers of Monday’s event, more than 900 people have been detained by ICE in Connecticut since 2023.
Holding candles and signs and wearing butterfly wings to symbolize free migration, attendees walked from the ice skating rink in the park to a roundabout where they placed pairs of empty shoes. As they walked, they sang the protest anthem “We Shall Not be Moved.“
“I decided to come out tonight because I feel for those who have been kidnapped,” said Saira Valencia, a Hartford resident. Valencia said that she has concerns for the safety of her own family members who have green cards but are not naturalized citizens. “Even though we may seem OK, we’re not always OK. The government, the state — they have every power to change everything for us.”
Speaking at the vigil, Vilma Aparicio-Deras, who was detained by ICE at a Newington car wash in August, told the crowd about her experience. Aparicio-Deras, who is from Guatemala, said that she was detained just days after having surgery for kidney stones. While in detention, she didn’t receive medical care and her condition worsened.
“Since I left detention, I’ve had a lot of limitations,” on what she can do, Aparicio-Deras told the crowd.
At the event, Leticia Cotto read the anonymous testimony of a person whose mother was detained by ICE. It read, in part, “I have PTSD from the trauma to my family by the constant churn of deportation. This has been catastrophic for all of us, with consequences. We’re not ever going to not think about this.”
In November, during a special legislative session, lawmakers voted to limit the actions ICE agents can take in courthouses, barring them from making arrests without a judicial warrant, or wearing masks there “unless medically necessary.” Lawmakers also approved legislation to prevent personal information, like residents’ locations and schedules, from being shared. While the new law protects residents’ data held by Connecticut agencies, it doesn’t have the power to stop federal agencies from sharing data with ICE.
Monday’s vigil was the latest effort by Hartford Deportation Defense, Jewish Voice for Peace and others to draw attention to the issue of ICE detentions. That effort can prove challenging, since many residents affected are concerned about government retribution for speaking to the media.
Len Virula, one of the speakers and organizers of the Monday night vigil, said she was glad to see Aparicio-Deras stand up in front of the crowd and tell her story. While organizers had asked others to speak, they had declined. Virula was also “shocked” at the large turnout on such a cold night. Seeing the crowd gathered in Hartford, “I feel like my heart grew bigger,” Virula said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_90A9173E5428-1-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 11:59:50.388372

Ben Sasse, R-Neb., travels Nebraska in 2020 aboard his campaign bus. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Former Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse is dying of “metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer,” he announced on social media Tuesday.
“Advanced pancreatic is nasty stuff; it’s a death sentence. But I already had a death sentence before last week too — we all do,” Sasse wrote.
Most of the political world knows Sasse from his time tussling with President Donald Trump over the direction of the Republican Party, including being one of seven Republicans who voted to convict the president following his impeachment in 2021. 
Sasse has been, in many ways, a traditional small-government conservative with an intellectual bent. He often critiqued the GOP’s turn toward populism under Trump and paid a price in public.
He made waves as a candidate running from academia, as then-president of Midland University in Fremont before being elected to the Senate in 2014. His friends describe him as an intense and philosophical thinker.
His foes describe him as a man who likes to prove he is the smartest person in the room. He and his family had discussed moving back to Nebraska, to the lakes, from Florida.


Friends-
This is a tough note to write, but since a bunch of you have started to suspect something, I’ll cut to the chase: Last week I was diagnosed with metastasized, stage-four pancreatic cancer, and am gonna die.
Advanced pancreatic is nasty stuff; it’s a death sentence.…
— Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) December 23, 2025
 
In the early days, he pressed his fellow Republicans to offer solutions to issues like health care instead of just talking about what they were against.
In practice, he told reporters he found the Senate and its politically limiting ways stifling to the sort of committee work and legislative progress he sought.
He did not ever repeal and replace Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, nor did he muster support for a clear legislative alternative.
But he found his legislative niche pushing back against the rise of China and the malfeasance of Russia online and in the real world, the changing face of war.
He told Americans early and often about the societal and economic disruption artificial intelligence would bring, calling it the next industrial revolution.
Much of his late Senate work focused on what he called “the future of work,” and he spoke often about the need to change education and training to meet new needs.
He left the Senate in early 2023 to lead the University of Florida until mid-2024, when he resigned to help care for his wife, Melissa, who had been ill.
Sasse typically dealt with her epilepsy and other ailments quietly, telling friends that his teens would be fine because they were a family that would work together.
He celebrated his closeness with Melissa since stepping back in the 185-word statement he posted, calling her “the best friend a man could ever have.”
“This is hard for someone wired to work and build, but harder still as a husband and a dad,” he wrote. “I can’t begin to describe how great my people are.” 
Sasse has three children, two daughters and a son. His post referenced his joy in their successes — one in the Air Force, one teaching and one learning to drive.
In it, he spoke about the situation his health would put his family through, not getting to walk his daughter down the aisle, burying him.
But he layered his message as he did in some of his speeches, with themes and reflections on the faith that buttressed him during difficult times with his wife and kids.
Sasse said he wouldn’t go down without a fight. He said he finds comfort in the idea of Christmas. And “gallows humor.” He said death and dying are not the same.
“We hope in a real Deliverer — a rescuing God, born at a real time, in a real place,” he said.”But the eternal city — with foundations and without cancer — is not yet.”

New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez announced this week the state had joined a coalition of nearly two dozen state attorneys general in a lawsuit against the Trump administration over defunding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

CFPB, the suit argues, has helped the AGs since its inception in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, “in their zealous advocacy for and protection of consumers in their respective
jurisdictions” and has returned $21 billion “improperly taken from over 205 million Americans,” a news release states.

However, CFPB Acting Director Russel Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, is “attempting to completely defund the agency by refusing to request any funding from the Federal Reserve,” the news release continues, “which will virtually guarantee the agency runs out of money in January 2026.”


The AGs argue that defunding the CFPB will have “devastating impacts” on consumers and on states’ consumer protection capabilities, given their reliance CFPB data, as well as the consumer complaints received by the agency.




“The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is one of the most effective tools we have to hold powerful financial institutions accountable and to put money back in the pockets of working families,” Torrez said in a statement. “Attempting to defund CFPB is not just reckless—it is unlawful, and it would leave millions of consumers without a critical line of defense against fraud, abuse, and predatory practices. New Mexico families deserve a federal government that enforces the law and protects consumers, not one that undermines the very agencies created to do that work.”




The AGs’ lawsuit argue not seeking funding for CFPB is both “unlawful and unconstitutional,” because the agency will be unable to provide its legally obligated information to states without funding. Moreover, not funding the CFPB, they say, violates the separation of powers principle, given that Congress created the agency.

The AG coalition seeks a court order requiring CFPB to request funding through the Federal Reserve, as established.




The other states in the suit include: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AGTorrezJan.28-1024x555.jpg,,,2025-12-23 11:59:50.388372

WILMINGTON, Del. — The Trump administration has ordered an immediate suspension of several major projects along the East Coast, citing national security concerns raised by the Pentagon — a move that could significantly affect the future of development in the Mid-Atlantic, including projects tied to Delaware.
The decision, announced by the U.S. Department of the Interior, pauses federal leases for five large offshore wind projects already under construction or in advanced stages: Vineyard Wind in Massachusetts; Revolution Wind off Rhode Island and Connecticut; Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York; and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind.
According to the administration, turbine towers and rotating blades interfere with military radar systems, potentially obscuring real targets or creating false signals — a risk the Pentagon said could compromise national security.
Delaware project not named — but not insulated
While the Maryland-Delaware project proposed by US Wind was not among the five projects specifically halted, energy and legal experts say the federal action sends a clear signal that all projects now face heightened scrutiny.
During Monday’s A Better Discussion webcast, former Delaware Attorney General M. Jane Brady said the federal move underscores why state-level approvals alone may not be enough to advance offshore wind development.  Brady is also the lead attorney of several offshore wind-related cases in Delaware.
“The further along projects get, the more permits that have been granted, the more they can rely upon those in an expenditure of funds,” Brady said. “That’s why we need to continue to challenge these issues at every step.”
US Wind’s project still requires federal approvals to proceed, even after Delaware lawmakers recently passed legislation overriding Sussex County’s denial of a proposed substation tied to the project.
“If federal agencies freeze or revoke leases,” Brady said, “state approval becomes irrelevant.”
National security concerns long debated
Energy executive Ken Reuter, a former Siemens Energy vice president who worked on projects earlier in his career, said the federal government’s concerns mirror longstanding issues within the defense and maritime communities.
“Onshore wind and offshore wind are like an apple and a prime rib roast,” Reuter said during the webcast. “They’re nowhere similar, except for the name of wind.”
Reuter cited the complexity of offshore construction, reliance on specialized vessels, and maintenance challenges at sea, noting that offshore wind requires constant marine operations that introduce additional costs and logistical risks.
“You’re burning diesel fuel, putting workers on boats, running them out to platforms,” he said. “It’s totally different.”
Financial and economic ripple effects
The suspension has already sent shockwaves through the industry. Stocks of major developers fell sharply following the announcement, raising concerns about financing and investor confidence across the East Coast market.
That uncertainty could affect promised economic benefits tied to the Maryland-Delaware project, including construction jobs, port investments and community benefit agreements that have been cited by supporters.
Reuter said broader energy policy decisions must account for reliability and economic competitiveness, particularly as states compete to attract data centers and other power-intensive industries.
“If we let the whole data-center market slip by us because we’re not able to produce electricity,” he said, “we are losing a huge opportunity.”
A turning point for offshore wind?
The administration’s move is part of a broader pattern of skepticism toward offshore wind development, particularly when weighed against defense readiness and grid reliability.
Brady said the pause may mark a turning point — but warned that legal and regulatory battles are far from over.
“That does not mean we don’t have to keep fighting at the local level,” she said. “The more invested a project becomes, the harder it is to stop.”
For Delaware, the decision places development in a more uncertain federal environment — one that could delay, reshape or ultimately halt projects that have already triggered years of political debate at the state and local levels.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/USwind_Main.jpg,,,2025-12-23 11:59:50.388372

Pamela Evette’s campaign for governor hit a milestone last week, as she completed her goal of visiting all of South Carolina’s 46 counties by year’s end.
She’d already been to every county since she became lieutenant governor in January 2019, she told the SC Daily Gazette.
But this five-month trip around the state, which started in Edgefield County in August, gave her a chance to talk with potential voters in their favorite local gathering spots.

“I want people to understand that I truly care,” she told the Gazette after her final stop of the tour.
While she’s campaigned and served alongside Gov. Henry McMaster since he picked her as a running mate in November 2017, Evette was still largely an unknown to many voters when she launched her campaign in July.
She touts that she’s the first and only candidate for governor of the entire seven-person field to meet with voters in every county.
She’s also the only one making her first solo run for elected office.
When McMaster chose her to be South Carolina’s first lieutenant governor elected as part of a joint ticket, the political novice was president and CEO of Quality Business Solutions, an outsourcing payroll and human resources firm operating out of Travelers Rest, where she lives.
She’s campaigning on her business credentials, saying that’s what voters want.
“No matter where I was — big city, small town — everybody really, the number one thing they expressed [was] they really wanted a business governor,” she said.
Stops included Harold’s Country Club in the Lowcountry town of Yemassee — a family-owned restaurant “proud to be in the middle of nowhere yet close to everything,” according to its slogan. She wrapped up her tour in Bishopville, home to the Lee County Veterans Museum, which displayed a surprising array of veterans’ personal items, including a captured Japanese flag with blood on it.
“I bet you, most people that are true war buffs have no idea that’s there,” she said. “We have so many gems like that in these little small towns.”
While in Bishopville, Evette also presented a letter of congratulations to Janice Atkinson, owner of The Little Florist, who was picked from among more than 15,000 applicants to help decorate the White House for Christmas.
During the tour, Evette said she saw first-hand what South Carolinians want fixed — for example, closed bridges in Chester County.
“It’s just amazing what you learn by being on the road,” she said.
Her sampling of food at restaurants along the way included all of South Carolina’s barbecue types, though ketchup-based remains her favorite. And she watched several football games, including Clemson’s 28-14 victory over South Carolina at the annual Palmetto Bowl rivalry held this year in Columbia.
One of Evette’s three children graduated from the University of South Carolina law school and another attends Clemson, so she stressed she wasn’t cheering for one over the other: “I’m just rooting for South Carolina,” she said.
Before the GOP primary on June 9, she said she wants to visit each county at least one more time.
The four other Republicans who have announced bids for the Governor’s Mansion are state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman, and Attorney General Alan Wilson.
On Monday, the state Republican Party announced the schedule for at least three debates between the GOP candidates — four if there’s a primary runoff.
The two Democrats in the race are state Rep. Jermaine Johnson and Charleston lawyer Mullins McLeod, who previously ran for governor in 2010 but dropped out ahead of the primary.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Farmer-2-Marlboro-County-Farmer-Roundtable-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 11:59:50.388372

Since Sept. 5, right-wing sports publication OutKick has published 19 articles about a 12th grade girls’ volleyball player at Skyline High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The player caught the attention of reporter Dan Zaksheske after he obtained public documents that appear to show her requesting a legal name change from a traditionally masculine first name to a traditionally feminine one.
Over the next three months, Zaksheske would write 18 of the 19 articles OutKick would publish about this student. He and other OutKick reporters attended multiple high school girls’ volleyball games where they recorded and reported on Skyline High’s volleyball season. At the heart of each article was a focus on the girl, who Zaksheske refers to as a “trans-identifying biological male.”
Zaksheske’s reporting stoked a controversy that drew the attention of multiple right-wing publications, politicians and influencers. This coverage led Sean Lechner, whose cisgender daughter played against Skyline and allegedly shared a locker room with their team, to file a Title IX complaint.

While the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) does require trans athletes to get a waiver approved to compete in official state tournaments, the Democrat-majority state Senate outright rejected the idea of a trans athlete sports ban earlier this year. In addition, LGBTQ Michiganders have strong anti-discrimination protections under the state’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act.
In the complaint, Lechner calls for a ban on “biological males from competing in female sports” and for a “full investigation into actions and communications of Ann Arbor Public Schools/Monroe High/Chet Hesson,” citing a Trump executive order that declares that trans-inclusive policies are in violation of Title IX.
Shortly after the complaint was filed, Uncloseted Media published an interview clip with Hesson, the athletic director of Monroe Public Schools, in which he simply said his “heart goes out” to the player for being under such scrutiny. Less than 24 hours later, he was put on administrative leave.
As this story spreads like wildfire, experts in journalistic ethics are raising concerns about Zaksheske’s reporting. 
“OutKick’s inflammatory reporting on a Michigan high school volleyball player who may or may not be trans disregards several core principles of the Society of Professional Journalists’ [SPJ] Code of Ethics,” Dan Axelrod, chairman of the SPJ’s ethics committee, told Uncloseted Media. SPJ’s Code of Ethics, originally drafted in 1973, has been embraced and used by thousands of journalists from numerous newsrooms and schools.
“The Code cautions reporters to ‘show compassion for those who may be affected by news coverage,’ and to ‘use heightened sensitivity when dealing with juveniles,’ while ‘weigh[ing] the consequences of publishing or broadcasting personal information,’” Axelrod says. “[OutKick] has essentially ignored all those ethical principles, given [Zaksheske’s] relentless coverage of the player, which has led the public to easily infer who she is, and its negative framing of her story.”

Ethical Questions
The player, whose mother did not respond to an interview request, does not appear to have publicly come out as trans prior to the publication of Zaksheske’s first article.
Chad Painter, associate professor and chair of the communications department at the University of Dayton, says this “brings up a whole host of issues.” While Zaksheske wrote that he did not name the girl “because the student athlete is under 18,” Painter says that doesn’t do enough to conceal her identity.
In his reporting, Zaksheske references the existence of publicly accessible name change documents, the girl’s county of residence and the name of a local volleyball club she’d been a part of. “Someone who is reasonably well-versed in being able to Google someone can figure this out pretty easily,” Painter, who has co-authored multiple media ethics textbooks, told Uncloseted Media.
“There’s longstanding norms in newsrooms that we don’t out people, that that is a very personal decision that an individual gets to make, and unless there is a massively compelling reason to do that, it’s not our role,” he says. “The idea that he is in the clear because he didn’t specifically write this person’s name in a story, it wouldn’t hold up to journalistic scrutiny.”

And Zaksheske’s reporting appears to have outed the girl. The same day that he published his first article on the matter, an X account whose mission is “to call out these male athletes and expose the damage that they have each caused to women and girls in sports” published the girl’s full name and deadname along with multiple photos and videos of her. (Uncloseted Media has chosen not to link to these posts directly in the interest of her privacy.)

In addition to the 18 articles Zaksheske wrote, he also tweeted about the situation at least 41 times and attended at least four high school girls’ volleyball games. While watching, he recorded videos of the girls playing and then posted them to X and OutKick’s website.
“Having 19 stories about one athlete … to me, that seems like this coverage is out of line with how we’d normally talk about, especially high school sports, which, frankly, no one outside of this little area in Michigan are going to really care about,” says Painter. 
“Outside of the culture war stuff, I don’t see where this is a story.”
When Zaksheske was confronted by multiple people at the school about attending and recording one of the games, he published another article accusing them of harassment. “I was shadowed by the school principal and harassed and stalked by Skyline supporters,” he wrote.
Painter notes that while Zaksheske was within his rights as a journalist and citizen to be attending and recording such events, he understands why the school would approach him with skepticism.
“I have a feeling that if I just started showing up randomly to high school volleyball games and taking photos and videos, there would probably be questions,” Painter says. “Because, again, we are talking about minors.”
“The reporter has a right to pursue news … and that right especially exists at a public school,” says Axelrod. “However, one has to wonder at what point is the coverage just pandering to curiosity as opposed to serving a valid societal purpose in informing and facilitating larger discussions about real and valid questions regarding the participation of trans athletes in sports.”
Misinformation and Animus
Zaksheske has pushed back against similar criticism on X, accusing those who question the ethics of his reporting of being “in favor of sterilizing, mutilating and castrating children” and characterizing his reporting as “exposing their heinous acts.”
“I don’t see that as an ethical problem because it doesn’t even enter into the world of ethics,” Painter says of Zaksheske’s rhetoric. “It is wrong factually and it doesn’t really have a place in what we do in terms of the journalism field.”
Misleading rhetoric about trans health care is common throughout OutKick’s reporting. Zaksheske has written several articles about gender-affirming care, where he has claimed that puberty blockers “take healthy children and sterilize them for life.”
Puberty blockers have been FDA-approved for treating precocious puberty in cisgender children since 1993. Multiple studies have found no evidence of them causing permanent infertility, and gynecologists and endocrinologists have said that they do not cause sterilization.
Much of Zaksheske’s coverage of trans people has been negative. Of adult trans women, he wrote that “that person might see himself as a woman, but we are under no obligation to ‘affirm’ that.” He also wrote that doctors who provide gender-affirming care “have to answer to their consciences.”
OutKick also generally misgenders trans women and girls, referring to them as “males,” “biological males” or “trans-identifying males,” additionally using masculine pronouns to refer to them. 
Painter notes that this goes against the “Associated Press Stylebook,” which he says “any newsroom worth its salt is going to follow.”
“The journalist and the news outlet squander their credibility covering these types of societal questions when they use language … that fails to recognize and respect the underlying humanity of an entire group of people,” he says.
In an email, Brian Karpas, OutKick’s director of media relations, told Uncloseted Media that the publication “stands by the thorough and responsible reporting of Dan Zaksheske and will continue to protect women from competing against biological males.”
Beyond Michigan
OutKick’s extensive reporting of the Michigan volleyball player is reflective of the publication’s increasingly conservative bent since it launched in 2011. In 2021, it was acquired by Fox Corporation. Since then, it has partnered with Fox News and has become home to numerous right-wing personalities known for anti-trans rhetoric. These include founder Clay Travis, who has said World Aquatics is “encouraging …super young kids to be transitioned”; Tomi Lahren, who said that liberals “don’t know what a woman is”; and Riley Gaines, who referred to an eighth-grade trans girl as a “mediocre man.”
This story in Michigan is not the first time OutKick and Zaksheske have hyperfocused on one trans girl. They were one of the first national publications to report on California-based track and field athlete AB Hernandez, who later became the center of a feud between the Trump administration and Gov. Gavin Newsom. Since March, OutKick has published at least 24 articles about Hernandez, 10 of which were written by Zaksheske. They sent reporters to at least two games to photograph Hernandez and other teenage players. Additionally, OutKick published 15 articles and attended at least four games covering the story of a trans softball player in Minnesota, whose presence on the team became a key point of a lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center-designated anti-LGBTQ hate group, Alliance Defending Freedom.
This massive amount of coverage is common for U.S. conservative media: A report published this year from Media Matters for America found that Fox News ran over 400 weekday segments mentioning trans athletes from Feb. 5 to June 6.
Consequences and Impact

All of this has had an impact. While the Title IX investigation is still pending, Hesson, who was named in the complaint, told Uncloseted Media that he had been targeted with harassment and vitriol online.

In the comments of the Instagram post, Hesson was attacked by numerous users: squaredbeach9 wrote, “Stop normalizing these freaks. You don’t give a bulimic chick a bucket and some gum.”
And others chimed in, saying:
● “Guaranteed he has child pron on an electronic device.”
● “Fuck off, poor tranny hates attention, give me a fn break.”
● “So a male playing in women’s sports. And this cuck is defending it.”
All of this has come even though Hesson is not directly affiliated with Skyline High School, which is part of a different district. As such, he was not involved in the decision to allow the girl to play, and he was also not privy to whether she had a waiver.
Still, Zaksheske’s 18 articles have catapulted this small story to the national level. Lechner has been interviewed by journalists sympathetic to his cause, including Dave Bondy and Fox Business anchors. And since Hesson was placed on administrative leave, the Daily Mail, CBS News, the Toledo Blade, WTVG, MLive, The Times of India and more have covered the story.
In addition, numerous right-wing lawmakers and candidates have endorsed Lechner’s complaint. Republican state Rep. James DeSana posted a statement to Facebook “calling for Chet Hesson to be removed immediately.”
“The public cannot have good discourse, debate, or dialogue without good information,” Painter says. “Supplying that information is the fundamental duty of the news media. When journalists are distracted by inconsequential stories, then we’re not spending the time to cover interesting and important news that our readers really need.”
Both Painter and Axelrod took note of the small number of known trans athletes in the U.S. Last year, the NCAA’s president told a Senate panel that fewer than 10 of the 510,000 college athletes affiliated with the organization were transgender.
“This controversy is part of a much larger national narrative about transgender athletes and the LGBTQ+ community as a whole,” Painter says. “The entire national conversation is based on virtually nothing, so this particular set of stories are based on an inconsequential premise.”
Going Forward
If the Department of Education does find that Title IX was violated, the school district could risk losing federal funding if it continues to allow trans athletes to compete.
Zaksheske has been pressuring the MHSAA to confirm whether a waiver was approved for the volleyball player to compete, citing a statement from early September in which the association said it had not yet approved any waivers for the semester. On Dec. 9, MHSAA confirmed that one waiver was granted in the fall season, though no details were given in the interest of the student’s privacy.
While research into the relative athletic capabilities of trans and cis women is ongoing, numerous experts and athletes say that politicized vitriol, misleading information and outsized media attention about trans athletes makes girls’ sports less safe for all athletes.
“There are real, valid, and necessary societal discussions to be had about trans athletes participating against competitors who don’t match their birth gender, and ethical journalism can have a place in informing those discussions,” Axelrod says. “At the end of the day, this woman is still a human, and a child at that, not a canvas for OutKick to paint a distorted picture of one individual who’s a tiny part of a much bigger societal dialogue about trans athletes.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-23-084831.png,,,2025-12-23 11:59:50.388372

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Bill filing for Oklahoma’s 2026 legislative session began in earnest early this month, and more than 100 new laws have already been proposed.


The deadline to introduce measures is Jan. 15 at 4 p.m, so there is still plenty of time for lawmakers to file what normally ends up being thousands of bills.
Realistically, only a couple of hundreds are ever signed into law.
Still, early proposals aim to protect Oklahomans from predatory home and auto insurance practices, increase transparency of public meetings, invest in public schools and exclude immigrants — legally present in the country and otherwise — from certain aspects of public life.
One measure, Senate Bill 1253 by Big Cabin Republican Micheal Bergstrom, aims to adjust the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefit administration to align with new federal guidelines, specifically those related to employment and other eligibility requirements.
Here is an early breakdown of bills filed for Oklahoma’s 2026 legislative session so far:
Insurance protections and tax breaks

	Tulsa Republican Rep. Mark Tedford filed a series of six measures aimed at protecting Oklahomans from various predatory insurance practices.

House Bill 2929 – prohibits home insurance providers from canceling or increasing premiums for people who make single claims based on large floods or claims older than five years.


House Bill 2930 – Prohibits auto insurance providers from using traffic tickets to adjust policies and increase premiums.


House Bill 2931 – Increases the value of certain annuity funds subject to the Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act, which helps keep Oklahomans holding health coverage policies with a provider that goes out of business, for example, insured while they make adjustments.


House Bill 2932 – Prohibits the recovery of the first $100,000 of bodily injury and/ or property damages for people who fail to maintain proper liability insurance on their vehicle.


House Bill 2933 – Requires insurance providers to report a slew of information to the Oklahoma Insurance Department, including but not limited to changes in policies and price hikes.


House Bill 2934 – Protects people from civil liability when they cause bodily injury or property damage while responding to the criminal act of another person, unless they’re an accomplice.

On the tax front, Oklahoma City Republican Rep. Emily Gise filed House Bill 2935, a tax break on diapers for infants.
Meanwhile, her fellow Republican from Catoosa, Rep. Derrick Hildebrant, refiled an income tax break for churches with “health care ministry” expenses in the form of House Bill 2942. It’s similar to his measure last year, which failed in the House Appropriations and Finance Subcommittee.
Proposed government ethics and transparency regulations

	
At least eight measures focused on forcing more transparency from the state government were filed, mostly by members of the far-right Republican coalition known as the Oklahoma Freedom Caucus. Blanchard Republican and Freedom Caucus member Sen. Kendal Sacchieri filed four of the proposed bills.

Senate Bills 1199 and 1200 – Add restrictions on financial conflicts of interest for public school and technology center boards. It also aims to limit certain financial interests to a 5% stake if board members, or their family, have a part in a local business acting as one of a few local suppliers of certain goods or services.


Senate Bill 1215 – Prohibits any state government entities, including individuals and public trusts, from entering into a non-disclosure agreement.


Senate Bill 1240 – Also dubbed the “Protect Taxpayers Act of 2026,” this measure prohibits state entities from spending public money to lobby on behalf of any issue or legislation. Punishment is whatever injunctive relief a defendant might claim, assuming a judge approves it. In other words, it requires a lawsuit to enforce.

Fellow Freedom Caucus members Sen. Prieto, R-Tulsa, and Rep. Olsen, R-Roland, filed similar measures in their respective chambers addressing public access and comment at meetings held by government entities.

Senate Bill 1206 by Prieto requires all government officials holding a meeting before the public, subject to the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act, to allow reasonable public comment periods and to formally address those comments in following meetings.


House Bill 2940 by Olsen, dubbed the “First Amendment Open Meetings Protection Act,” requires public bodies holding meetings to allow members of the public to record. Attempts to prohibit recording can be met with legal action and monetary compensation determined by a judge.

Sen. Brian Guthrie, R-Bixby, while not a member of the Freedom Caucus, filed Senate Bill 1252, which aims to accomplish much of the same as Prieto and Olsen’s bills.
Early school funding measures

	
Sen. Adam Pugh, R- Edmond, is the Senate Education Committee Chair and a candidate for Oklahoma’s next State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He’s filed two early measures aiming to inject money into public schools.

Senate Bill 1189 – Enables a $50 million from the School Security Revolving Fund to be distributed evenly among all 500-plus school districts in the state over three years, if there is enough money in the account. It’s unclear what the fund’s total balance is, but the injection would be less than $100,000 per district.


Senate Bill 1193 – Allows smaller school districts to keep unused state appropriations and still get money for the following fiscal years.

Attempts to exclude immigrants from public life

	
Sen. Sacchieri filed six measures aimed at restricting the lives of immigrants in Oklahoma.

Senate Bill 1211 – Disqualifies H1-B visa holders, who are highly skilled employees hired from abroad by companies operating in the U.S. and considered ‘nonimmigrants,’ in federal statute, from certain Ad Valorem tax breaks on their owned property.


Senate Bill 1222 – Prohibits the issuance and use of driver’s licenses without an address on them, invalidates such licenses issued in other states and increases the fines on commercial drivers who carry them as identification.


Senate Bill 1223 – Requires commercial truck drivers to meet certain English Language Proficiency standards before driving. The proposed fine for not meeting it is $1,000.


Senate Bill 1230 – Requires Service Oklahoma verify ‘legal presence’ in the U.S. for REAL ID applicants.


Senate Bill 1231 – Prohibits members of the public not in possession of a “digital ID” from refusing access by state government officials to any location.
Senate Bill 1243 – Requires anyone driving in Oklahoma to be a U.S. citizen or ‘legal resident’ of the country. It also mandates a “citizen marker” to be displayed on newly issued IDs, while prohibiting the issuance of identification to anyone who can’t prove they are a citizen or lawfully in the U.S.

(Photo by Getty Images)Animal-welfare advocates say that while one of Iowa’s biggest puppy-mill operators is no longer licensed, he is still selling dogs and has ramped up the illegal practice of puppy laundering.
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals claims in a court filing that one of Iowa’s most prolific violators of the Animal Welfare Act, Steve Kruse of West Point, hasn’t ceased operations with the loss of his license, but has actually expanded the “illegal activities” intended to facilitate the sale of puppies and dogs.
In September 2024, the ASPCA filed a seven-count civil complaint against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the federal agency that polices animal breeders and brokers at the national level.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The ASPCA alleged the USDA has knowingly allowed illegal activity to occur through its issuance of licenses to Kruse and two of his associates, Brian Lichirie and Wuanita Swedlund, and by failing to revoke any of their licenses.
The case centers on the USDA’s alleged failure to act in response to its own written findings that Kruse has used Lichirie and Swedlund to engage in puppy laundering – the practice of routing dogs to retailers through intermediary breeders, allowing Kruse’s dogs to be sold even in states that restrict the sale of animals originating from kennels owned by repeat violators.
Aside from a USDA motion to dismiss the lawsuit, there was very little activity in the case until Oct. 8, 2025, when U.S. District Court Judge Jia M. Cobb noted that so much time had passed that Kruse’s three-year USDA license had expired. The judge asked the USDA and the ASPCA to each submit briefs as to whether the expiration of Kruse’s license rendered any part of the case moot.










It appears that Mr. Kruse continues to engage in regulated activities, despite the cancellation of his license, and continues his scheme to launder puppies.


– ASPCA, in a civil lawsuit against the USDA


In its filing, the USDA recently suggested the five claims concerning enforcement against Lichirie and Swedlund remained live, while the two counts specific to Kruse were moot and should be dismissed. Without a license, the USDA argued, there is no issue of enforcement the court can address.
Last week, the ASPCA filed its own brief, contending all seven counts should proceed, arguing the USDA “did not offer any indication that they had conducted an inquiry or investigation as to whether Mr. Kruse continues to participate in the venture even without his license, still owns the land on which the kennels operate, or otherwise maintains involvement in the ongoing enterprise.”
The ASPCA alleges that while Kruse is no longer licensed, its investigation suggests he “remains actively involved in regulated activity under the Animal Welfare Act, despite the cancellation of his license.”

Inset photo taken by USDA inspector, courtesy of Bailing Out Benji)
The APCA notes that days after Kruse’s license was canceled in August 2025, the USDA approved Christine A. Snakenberg for a license to do business at the same West Point address where Kruse has for years operated a large-scale kennel.
The USDA’s pre-license inspection report for Snakenberg indicates there were 142 adult dogs on the property when the inspector visited and the federal agency agreed to grant her a license.
Kruse still owns that property, the ASPCA says, and Snakenberg, who is not a co-owner, owns a single family, owner-occupied home 19 miles away in Danville.
In addition, the ASPCA says, an Illinois Bureau of Animal Welfare inspection report dated Nov. 26, 2025, shows that Kruse himself “continues to supply dogs” to Ray Duckmanton, an Illinois-licensed breeder doing business as Racore Inc.
“These records demonstrate that Mr. Kruse has not ceased his unlawful activities,” the ASPCA argues. “It appears that Mr. Kruse continues to engage in regulated activities, despite the cancellation of his license, and continues his scheme to launder puppies through his associates in violation of the Animal Welfare Act — including through Snakenberg, who the USDA has licensed to conduct regulated activities on Mr. Kruse’s property.”
In its brief to the court, the ASPCA alleges that the USDA has historically failed to act even when its own inspectors have confirmed that a previously licensed individual is still engaged in breeding or brokering. The organization adds that the USDA, in its brief to the court, has not argued that the alleged illegal activity has halted and has instated stated only that Kruse is no longer licensed.
“There is nothing preventing Mr. Kruse from reapplying, and nothing suggesting that the agency would not re license him if he did,” the ASPCA argues. “Thus, it is entirely likely, and expected, that the wrongful behavior by the defendants will continue.”
The ASPCA claims the USDA wrote to Kruse nine years ago, in 2016, to inform him that federal law required him, Lichirie and Swedlund to operate under a single license. When Kruse failed to take corrective action, the ASPCA claims, the USDA continued to renew his license and never took any steps to revoke the licenses of either Lichirie or Swedlund.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seeks a court order that would force the USDA to void all current licenses issued to Kruse and his associates.

Classic Rock Across Generations: Launch Brings Queen, Boston and Styx to Wilmington on Dec. 27
WILMINGTON, Del. — The music that helped define arena rock and shape generations of fans will echo through downtown Wilmington on Friday, Dec. 27, when Launch takes the stage at the Queen Theatre, featuring music from Queen, Boston, and Styx.
The concert is designed as a celebration of classic rock’s most enduring era — music that continues to resonate across age groups, from longtime fans who grew up with it on vinyl and FM radio to younger listeners discovering it through films, streaming playlists and family road trips.
Each of the featured bands left a lasting mark on rock history.
Queen redefined what a rock band could be, blending operatic ambition with stadium-sized anthems. Frontman Freddie Mercury’s theatrical style and the band’s genre-crossing sound helped elevate rock concerts into full-scale performances. In contrast, songs like “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “We Will Rock You” became cultural touchstones still heard at sporting events and celebrations worldwide.
Boston helped usher in the polished sound of arena rock in the mid-1970s, proving that technical precision and powerful melodies could coexist with raw energy. Their debut album remains one of the best-selling first records in music history, influencing how rock was recorded and produced for decades.
Styx bridged progressive rock and mainstream appeal, combining storytelling, layered harmonies and synthesizers with radio-friendly hooks. Their success helped push rock toward more ambitious compositions without losing mass appeal.
Launch brings these influences together in a single night, recreating the sound, feel and musical craftsmanship that made each band iconic. Rather than focusing on one catalog, the group presents a shared history of rock — highlighting how these bands collectively shaped the sound that dominated arenas and airwaves for more than a generation.
Organizers say the Dec. 27 show is intentionally family-friendly, welcoming longtime fans and newcomers alike. For many, it offers a chance to pass down the music they love to younger audiences in a live setting, where the power of classic rock is fully felt.
The Queen Theatre has become a regional destination for tribute and legacy concerts, offering an intimate venue where large-scale music can still feel personal. That setting allows audiences to experience songs originally written for stadiums in a space where every note is close and immediate.
Launch performs Friday, Dec. 27, at the Queen Theatre in Wilmington. Doors open at 7 p.m., with the show beginning at 8 p.m. Tickets are available through the Queen Theatre box office and website.
For fans of classic rock — and for those discovering it for the first time — the concert promises a night that celebrates why this music continues to endure, connect and inspire across generations.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Interior8.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 10:58:29.315488

The next-generation aircraft will serve patients across Delaware, increasing ChristianaCare’s 24/7 capability to transport critically ill and injured patients.
NEW CASTLE, Del. — ChristianaCare and Air Methods marked a major milestone in emergency medical response Dec. 17 with the ribbon cutting of a new Airbus H145 D3 helicopter for ChristianaCare LifeNet at New Castle Airport.
The next-generation aircraft joins ChristianaCare’s LifeNet air medical program, operated in partnership with Air Methods, and will serve patients across Delaware and parts of Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Officials said the helicopter is the first H145 D3 operating in the Northeast, strengthening the program’s 24/7 capability to transport critically ill and injured patients.
“At ChristianaCare, our mission is to serve our neighbors,” said Ric Cuming, chief operating officer at ChristianaCare. “This Airbus H145 D3 is not just a new mode of transport but an innovative leap forward in how we deliver critical medical services during those urgent moments when every second truly matters.”
The aircraft brings advanced safety and performance features, including a five-bladed main rotor system, enhanced engines and Helionix avionics. Program leaders said those upgrades increase payload capacity, reduce vibration and noise, and improve reliability and patient comfort while enabling crews to operate more efficiently in challenging conditions.
Dr. Christopher Rogan, vice chair of Prehospital Services and medical director of LifeNet/CareNet at ChristianaCare, said the helicopter’s technology ensures high-quality care is delivered regardless of location. “Our goal is to create a safe haven for our patients from the moment our care team arrives,” Rogan said.
More than 50 health care leaders, first responders and industry partners attended the ceremony, which included remarks from ChristianaCare, Air Methods and Airbus leadership, along with tours of the aircraft.
Steve Konold, regional vice president at Air Methods, called the helicopter “a powerful symbol of what strong partnerships can achieve,” noting the collaboration raises the bar for air medical transport across the region.
John Roussis, program director at ChristianaCare, said the investment enhances both patient care and crew safety. “It strengthens our ability to reach patients when and where they need us most,” he said.
Airbus officials said the H145 D3 delivers the latest rotor and avionics technology to support lifesaving missions, reinforcing ChristianaCare’s commitment to advanced, accessible emergency care.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-23-101925.jpg,,,2025-12-23 10:58:29.315488

The congresswoman will vie for the seat held by Sen. Lummis, who announced last week she is not seeking reelection. 
The post Wyoming’s Rep. Harriet Hageman announces run for U.S. Senate appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman will run for U.S. Senate in 2026.
“We must keep up this fight. And that’s why today I am announcing my campaign for United States Senate,” Hageman said in a campaign video. 
The announcement follows last week’s news that Sen. Cynthia Lummis would not seek reelection and would retire in 2027 after serving in the upper chamber since 2020. Lummis earlier this year indicated she would seek a second term, but said last week that she realized she didn’t have the energy for another six years in office.
Hageman quickly announced that she would pursue the suddenly open seat. 
“For forty-six years in jobs with the public trust, Cynthia Lummis has embodied the clear-eyed common sense that Wyoming is known for,” Hageman wrote in a statement on Lummis last week. “Her retirement marks the close of an extraordinary era in our state’s political history — one defined by integrity, independence, and unwavering devotion to the people she served.” 
Hageman was first elected Wyoming’s sole congressperson in 2022, soundly defeating then-Rep. Liz Cheney in the Republican primary with the backing of President Donald Trump. The race drew national attention as Hageman triumphed over one of Trump’s harshest Republican critics.
Since then, Hageman has remained loyal to Trump and popular among Republican voters in Wyoming. 
Hageman announcing a Senate run is likely to set other GOP candidates in motion, particularly those who have expressed deference to the congresswoman and her plans. Both Secretary of State Chuck Gray and Speaker of the House Chip Neiman previously told news outlets their 2026 plans hinge on Hageman.  
Who’s Hageman?
Born in Douglas and raised on a ranch near Fort Laramie, Hageman attended Casper College before earning a bachelor’s and a law degree from the University of Wyoming. As a trial attorney, Hageman spent several decades opposing environmentalists and federal regulations.
Before serving in Congress, Hageman was an active member in the Laramie County GOP, including as a delegate at the National Republican Convention in 2016, where she supported Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas over Trump. 
Two years later, she lost a bid for Wyoming governor, placing third behind Foster Friess and Mark Gordon. 
In January, Hageman was named chairwoman of the House Committee on Natural Resources’ Water, Wildlife and Fisheries Subcommittee. 
In that role, she has sought to delist grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from the Endangered Species Act. She’s also worked to reverse the Bureau of Land Management’s resource management plan for its Rock Springs, which she has described as a threat to Wyoming’s fossil fuel industries. Alongside Lummis and Sen. John Barrasso, Hageman introduced legislation in October to overturn a Biden-era ban on new federal coal leasing in northeast Wyoming. 
In March, as Republican congressional leadership urged members to stop hosting in-person town halls to avoid angry constituents and viral confrontations, Hageman held a town hall in Laramie.

After more than 500 people showed up, the congresswoman faced tough questions and angry constituents, several of whom pressed Hageman for answers about the federal government’s mass layoff of federal workers. 
“It’s so bizarre to me how obsessed you are with the federal government,” she said when asked about the fate of Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks.
“You guys are going to have a heart attack if you don’t calm down,” Hageman said. “I’m sorry, you’re hysterical.”
In September, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appointed Hageman to a newly formed congressional committee tasked with further investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

Jim Pillen during a 2025 event honoring social workers, resigned her position because of concerns with operations at the National Association of Social Workers. She led the Nebraska NASW chapter. (Photo submitted by Jessyca Vandercoy)TOPEKA — Social workers nationwide directed furious complaints toward their national association, demanding accountability, transparency and an external review of finances in the wake of a structural realignment that jettisoned 14 state-level leaders.
Four state chapter boards of directors resigned in protest and other state leaders wrote letters to the National Association of Social Workers board of directors after it announced the reorganization in November.
In South Dakota, the chapter’s board told members that whistleblowers alleged “harmful dynamics” at the national office, including questionable spending and a “troubling” consolidation of power.
“These communications raise serious concerns about governance and ethical practices within the Association,” the chapter said in a letter to members.
The letter encouraged social workers to reach out to the national board and ask for a vote of no confidence in NASW CEO Anthony Estreet.
Estreet was selected in 2023 to become the organization’s CEO, after serving on the board for several years.
A letter from the Michigan NASW chapter was equally blunt.
“It is our duty to keep NASW leadership accountable to the core values we hold as social workers, including integrity, transparency, accountability, and collaborative governance,” the letter said. “At this time, the NASW–Michigan Board finds that these standards are not being upheld, and our unanimous vote of no confidence reflects serious and ongoing concerns.”
The letter listed issues that include quality and transparency of national leadership communications and lack of meaningful response to issues raised by chapters.
Letters from Rhode Island, Kansas, Kentucky and Texas were written in the same vein, and each asked for an accounting from the national organization about restructuring decisions and failure to communicate clearly. Several demanded an external investigation.


Online outcry
Unrest among members of the National Association of Social Workers spawned numerous online posts and the creation of social media accounts. They include the following.

An Instagram account called “investigatecorruptionatnasw.”
Multiple active Reddit threads, including NASW whistleblowers are back.
A Substack post from Arkansas social worker Angela Campagna, who said, “The resignation of the NASW Arkansas Chapter Board exposes something deeper than organizational fracture it reveals the growing tension between the daily reality of frontline social work and the structures meant to represent us.”
An in-depth look at the situation on The Macro Lens, called “Deafening Silence: NASW Restructuring and the Fear of Speaking Up.”



LaToya Evans, an external communications expert hired by NASW, said an investigation is not planned. 
“Investigate what?” she said. “Like, no one’s giving me any proof of anything. What are we going to investigate? What are we going to do?”
 
Concerns raised
In October, the NASW’s treasurer and compliance officer, Sylvester Bowie, sent an email to members saying he had received correspondence “raising concerns about sensitive organizational management and operational issues.”
“The board takes its fiduciary responsibilities very seriously and is committed to oversight of the organization,” the email said. “The Board will promptly review relevant information and determine what additional steps, if any, are necessary to address the financial concerns raised, as well as any other allegations within the Board’s scope.”
In response to Kansas Reflector questions about unrest within the organization, Evans referred to annual financial audits by an independent accounting firm.
“NASW has also been audited annually for the past two decades by an independent firm, and they continue to have clean audits with no evidence of financial mismanagement,” she said.
Most financial audits do not uncover fraud, which is typically found when tips are received, according to the National Council of Nonprofits.
“There was no formal internal investigation per se, but a committee did look into the allegations in letters. Dr. Estreet was never under any investigation,” Evans said. “This is false.”
 
‘No proof’ 
Evans said the whistleblower letters referred to by boards were unsigned and contained no specific allegations to investigate.
And she said no proof of any financial mismanagement or other issues has been shown to the national board of directors.
“Have you seen it? You haven’t. Because, if you’ve seen it, please furnish it for me. Because if people are writing all these letters and they’re saying financial mismanagement, no one has said one plus one equals five,” she said. “No one has a receipt, no one has a copy of anything. Because typically when someone is saying financial mismanagement, they have documentation of it.”
With no proof, the allegations being made by state chapter members are upsetting and don’t make sense, Evans added.
“It’s a lot of unfounded claims of people who just want to complain,” she said.
In an email to membership Dec. 8, the NASW board pointed members to audits of the organization’s annual financial statements that found no problems and directed them to access the 990 financial forms required to be filed by nonprofit associations.
 
Demanding accountability
An online letter asks social workers to sign on to demand the national organization become more transparent and accountable. The author of the letter is unclear, but it lays out numerous questions signees would like to see answered, including a section on NASW financials.
Data in the 990s shows that from 2014 through 2020, NASW “experienced persistent operational deficits,” but that began to turn around in 2021, the letter says.
“We recognize the seriousness of these long-term financial challenges and acknowledge the need for strong corrective action,” it says. “It makes sense that there were conversations nearly a decade ago about restructuring.”
Financial patterns beginning in 2021 showed that “day-to-day operations have been stable and largely sustainable for the last several years,” the letter says. In 2023 and 2024, there were major increases in liabilities and a decline in assets.
“These types of shifts are typically caused by non-operational financial events, such as legal or insurance-related obligations, recognition of contingent liabilities, related-party financial impacts, and accounting reclassifications or corrections,” the letter says. “These events are national-level issues, not chapter-level failings. It is therefore essential to understand the true drivers of the restructuring decision.”
The letter asks that the board and Estreet, the CEO, schedule a virtual open forum so members can ask questions.
Evans said board president Yvonne Chase has scheduled a meeting with volunteer chapter presidents.
“They invited her to chat and she is doing that while also planning other town halls and listening sessions,” Evans said. “Dr. Estreet previously had a town hall with members and staff after the reorganization announcement.”

Restructuring
NASW announced the structural realignment a few weeks ago, eliminating 14 state leader positions and merging some states together to be overseen by one director. Kansas leader Becky Fast was laid off and the state’s chapter is now grouped with Iowa.
The leaders who were let go, some of whom oversaw two chapters, covered Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; Georgia; Guam; Kansas and Oklahoma; Kentucky; Missouri; North Dakota; Pennsylvania; Tennessee; Utah; Virginia and Washington, D.C.; and Washington and Hawaii.
A letter signed by Arkansas chapter board members, all of whom resigned, said the decision to remove state leadership failed “to uphold principles of transparency, accountability, fairness and responsiveness to community needs.”
Jessyca Vandercoy led the Nebraska NASW chapter for 18 months before she resigned, citing concerns about the direction the national organization was going and decision-making transparency.
It was her dream job, she said, especially the opportunity to follow the social worker code of ethics, which has a mandate for social and political advocacy.
Vandercoy was part of a council of chapter executives, a small group of chapter leaders who worked with the national organization. She said they were tasked with giving feedback about the model that put one executive director over two states, which has now been implemented.
Although the group found benefits to the model, it raised concerns about whether states would have advocacy at a strong enough level to support local chapters, among other issues, she said.
Those issues were not addressed, and she was upset when the national board chairwoman sent a letter saying they had “rigorously vetted and planned for” the new structure, Vandercoy said.
Instead, there was no open communication about the concerns raised by chapter executives, she said. One concern was the importance of having a person working in the state who is able to attend legislative hearings and to build relationships with state officials.
“This is not something to take lightly, because the relationship between the social workers in the state and our executive director is absolutely essential to get policy passed, even to know what social workers want in that state,” Vandercoy said.
 
‘A difficult time’
Evans said the reorganization that resulted in the combining of chapters is a process that’s been in the works for 10 years, part of NASW’s attempts to modernize its structure.
“Nearly three dozen chapters have been reliant on Chapter Development Funds, meaning they are not financially independent and need additional financial support from membership and national revenue to meet basic operational and chapter goals,” Evans said. “To continue being a national resource for social workers, the move to a Dual Chapter (executive director) model became financially necessary.”
Chapter executive directors, though, argue that some of the consolidated chapters were on strong financial standing and had funds in accounts that will now be rolled into the national organization.
As stories ran nationwide about NASW’s restructuring and how upset social workers were, NASW issued a Dec. 8 communication that some felt missed the point.
“While we acknowledge that this is a difficult time for NASW, we are confident that we are moving in the right direction,” board president Chase wrote in an email to members. “We intend to keep all members and staff aware of any additional changes and will continue to keep transparent, ethical, and honest communication at the forefront. Actions from Board meetings are regularly posted on the NASW website once available.”
Evans said NASW will be able to reduce spending in areas where there are financial deficits but still provide organizational resources, especially in chapters where states have fewer than 1,000 members.
 
Insurance problems
The restructure set afire smoldering tensions that began more than a year ago.
In September 2024, Preferra Insurance Co. Risk Retention Group, which offered discounted professional liability insurance to NASW members, filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., courts, where NASW is headquartered.
The lawsuit named NASW and its two subsidiary insurance companies.
Preferra alleged the three entities violated contracts that managed the way the three businesses worked together.
In case documents, Preferra also said NASW CEO Estreet and chief financial officer Sekou Murphy didn’t understand the insurance regulatory environment. The result was a disagreement between the companies about how dollars paid to NASW through the insurance program would be calculated, the filings said.
At the same time, Preferra discovered Estreet failed to disclose his criminal record while seeking approval for a seat on the company’s board.
“Preferra subsequently learned that Dr. Estreet has a criminal conviction for burglary as well as licensing issues that he did not disclose to Preferra and thus were not included in the application to (District of Columbia Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking), which requires such information to be disclosed,” the Preferra case complaint said.
NASW filings denied Preferra’s accusations, calling it a “work of fiction, intended solely to obscure the misdeeds of (Preferra CEO) Anthony Benedetto.”
Benedetto also served as CEO of NASW’s insurance companies until early in 2024, when he was dismissed, NASW said. The nonprofit’s attorneys accused Benedetto of abusing his position.
NASW said its CEO and chief financial officer asked questions about Preferra’s consolidated audited financial reports, which Benedetto and his team refused to answer.
Ultimately, the two companies settled the lawsuit and parted ways, filing a dismissal in court on July 31.
AM Best, a national insurance rating company, in October placed NASW Insurance Co. “under review with negative implications status,” according to the Insurance Journal.
The review was issued because of uncertainty regarding NASWIC’s prospective business plans to operate on a stand-alone basis,” the Journal reported.
In November, Preferra announced it was teaming up with the Council on Social Work Education to offer insurance with discounts for social workers.
NASW is developing a new product in 2026 to provide social workers with professional liability insurance at a discounted rate and membership benefit, Evans said.

Estreet’s history
As the Preferra case played out in court, social workers from around the country learned about Estreet’s criminal history. They were concerned he may not have disclosed it to the board, and many said they didn’t feel as if the organization’s leadership was transparent about what was happening.
Evans said the board did a background check on Estreet before he was hired and was aware of his criminal history, which happened when he was “practically a teenager.”
Brenda Rosen, who led the Kentucky NASW chapter until being let go in November, said that as a social worker, she believes strongly in and works with many people “living in recovery.”
She and two other social workers Kansas Reflector spoke with emphasized that they have no issues with someone who has a criminal history.
“I have so much respect for people who live in recovery, or who have committed a crime, paid their time, and are giving back, if you will, to society by being social workers,” Rosen said. “So when I say that this guy, the CEO, was being dishonest about his felonies, I take that really seriously because to me, the ethics are own it. Own it. Name it and highlight the good things you’ve done. Don’t make it look like somebody else is attacking you. Be honest.”
As social media posts percolated online, NASW’s board made a statement in September 2024 in support of Estreet and national staff.
The NASW board encouraged members to engage in “constructive and honest dialogue and to rely on official communications from NASW and its chapters for accurate information about the organization.”
 
What’s next?
NASW members are demanding accountability, and they’re hoping for stronger communications, Vandercoy said. It’s concerning that social workers may drop their membership over the situation. But the organization won’t go away, she said.
“I think in a lot of ways, NASW is too big to fail. They hold our code of ethics,” Vandercoy said. “They issue standards of practice that are rooted in research and evidence, which is also part of our code of ethics, so that, I think, continues to exist. So what does it become?”
Vandercoy was uncertain of the answer, but she is seeing states tackle the issue on their own as they are losing faith in their national association. In Nebraska, she’s been contacted by several people interested in starting some local work outside of NASW.
“For me, I’m not going to spend any time being — probably the wrong words, but jaded or angry at what’s happened,” she said. “There is too much important work to do.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Jessyca-Vandercoy-1-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-12-23 10:13:09.217197

(Photos courtesy of the Office of Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger on Tuesday announced two additional cabinet appointments, tapping longtime Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, to serve as Virginia’s next secretary of finance and public administrator Traci Deshazor as her secretary of administration, rounding out key leadership roles as she prepares to take office.
Sickles’ departure from the state legislature will also trigger a special election in the strongly Democratic House District 17, a seat that includes parts of Fairfax County, before the General Assembly is set to convene for its 2026 session next month.  
Spanberger said Sickles, a senior budget writer in the House of Delegates, will bring deep fiscal expertise and a bipartisan approach to managing the state’s finances. Deshazor, a Danville native with experience across local, state and federal government, will oversee core administrative functions ranging from elections to workforce support.
“The secretary of finance plays an essential role in guaranteeing Virginia’s long-term economic strength, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and addressing the challenges facing Virginia communities,” Spanberger said in a statement. 
She pointed to Sickles’ role as vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee and said he has worked with lawmakers of both parties to pass budgets that offered tax relief for families while supporting economic growth.
Spanberger said Sickles shares her commitment to fiscal responsibility and to ensuring taxpayer dollars are used effectively, adding that she expects him to be a key partner in her administration’s efforts to lower costs for families and secure Virginia’s long-term financial footing.
Sickles, who is completing his 22nd year representing parts of South Fairfax County, said he is looking forward to assisting Spanberger as she works to make life in Virginia more affordable. 
He said the administration must deliver results for families, young people and seniors by building budgets that reflect shared values and reduce the cost of living.
“We need to make sure every tax dollar is employed to its greatest effect for hard-working Virginians,” Sickles said, citing priorities such as keeping tuition low, expanding affordable housing, ensuring teachers are properly compensated and making quality health care accessible and affordable. 
Sickles is widely known in Richmond for his influence over health and human services spending. Since 2004, he has served on — and chaired — the House Health and Human Services Committee. He joined the Appropriations Committee in 2014 and currently chairs its Health and Human Resources Subcommittee.
He has also played a central role in budget negotiations, having been appointed to the House-Senate budget conference committee in 2018 and reappointed each year since by successive House speakers. 
Sickles currently chairs the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission and serves on several other influential panels, including the Major Employment Investment Commission, the Joint Commission on Health Care and the Governor’s Advisory Committee on Revenue Estimates.
Over his legislative career, Sickles has helped shepherd major policy changes through the General Assembly, including the transition from the federal health insurance marketplace to the Virginia Health Insurance Exchange, election administration reforms, legalization of sports betting and the creation of the Virginia Innovation Partnership Authority. 
He has also championed investments in libraries, endangered species protection and bioscience initiatives, and is the patron of a pending constitutional amendment to protect marriage equality for LGBTQ Virginians.
Alongside Sickles’ appointment, Spanberger named Deshazor as her secretary of administration, a role responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations that underpin state government.
She described Deshazor as a knowledgeable leader focused on making government work better for people at both the state and local levels.
Deshazor said her career has been centered on ensuring public institutions are effective and results-driven, and she emphasized the importance of administration as the foundation of good governance. 
“I will bring a people-first, outcomes-driven approach to strengthening Virginia’s operations, promoting transparency, and strengthening trust in government,” Deshazor said.
Deshazor brings experience from multiple levels of government. 
Most recently, as the deputy chief administrative officer for human services in Richmond, she oversaw a six-agency portfolio with more than 1,000 employees. During that time, she helped create a new Department of Neighborhood and Community Services, launched offices focused on homelessness and community services, and established a community resource and training center. 
She also served concurrently as the city’s first chief equity officer.
At the state level, Deshazor previously served as deputy secretary of the commonwealth under Govs. Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe, supervising teams responsible for core constitutional and administrative functions. 
In that role, she supported clemency efforts and contributed to actions restoring civil and voting rights to more than 300,000 Virginians and to the granting of thousands of pardons and sentence computations.
Earlier in her career, she represented Virginia as deputy director of intergovernmental affairs, working with Congress, the White House and federal agencies.
A graduate of programs at the University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Yale University, Virginia Tech and Hollins University, Deshazor lives in Richmond with her husband and said she remains committed to serving the commonwealth she has always called home.

Minnesota’s ethanol mandate, on the books for more than two decades, works against that. 
All gasoline sold in Minnesota must contain at least 10% ethanol, a fuel made from fermenting sugars from plants like corn. In 2003, ours was the first state to mandate that every gas station sells E10 blends. The federal renewable fuel standard, or RFS,  followed in 2005, requiring a certain volume of ethanol and other renewable fuels be blended into U.S. gasoline supplies, setting annual volume targets. Ethanol now accounts for nearly 45% of total corn use.   
This competing use of corn has raised its price, increasing the cost of food used as livestock feed. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that demand for ethanol has raised Americans’ total food spending by 0.8 to 2%. Another estimate suggests that corn prices were 30% greater between 2006 and 2011 as a result of the RFS mandate. As corn becomes more lucrative for farmers — and corn farms received $3.2 billion, or 30.5% of all federal farm subsidies in 2024 — cropland is diverted from other crops and livestock, raising prices for all crops. 
Ethanol mandates increase prices at the pump as well. The federal RFS adds about 30 cents per gallon to the wholesale cost of gas, on average. Consumers pay more for each gallon and use more gas because of ethanol’s lower energy content, which leads to about 3% lower fuel efficiency for E10. 
These higher prices might be justified if there was some environmental benefit, but there isn’t. Indeed, ethanol may increase carbon emissions. Ethanol production requires feedstock, the fertilizers used during growing, the fuel and energy used during refining, the milling process, and increased land use for corn, all of which generate carbon emissions. 
A 2022 study concluded that RFS expanded U.S. corn cultivation by 8.7% between 2008 and 2016 and suggests that ethanol’s carbon intensity is likely “at least 24% higher” than gasoline after accounting for land use changes. 
Once indirect land-use effects are considered, ethanol can have twice the greenhouse gas emissions as gasoline. A 2015 study suggests that the RFS’ overreliance on corn ethanol has resulted in “unmet targets for cutting air pollution, water contamination and soil erosion.” Another study points out that that emissions from burning ethanol contain more ozone precursors than emissions from gasoline, with adverse respiratory health effects when released at ground level. Ethanol also demands water, uses fertilizers that leech nitrogen into surrounding waterways, and encourages unsustainable land management practices that lead to soil erosion. 
None of this is the fault of Minnesota farmers, who operate under the incentives that the state and federal government have put into place. 
Policymakers in St. Paul and Washington, D.C., bear the responsibility of fixing these incentives.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)For Alaska’s fishing industry and fishing-dependent communities, 2025 was a year of turmoil and uncertainty, much of it imposed by ideological pursuits from the new Trump administration.
The short-lived agency called the Department of Government Efficiency hacked away at federal funding for science across the board. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in particular was in its crosshairs; the Heritage Institute’s Project 2025 blueprint for the second Trump administration heaped scorn on NOAA, saying its National Weather Service, National Marine Fisheries Service and other agencies “form a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity.” The NMFS’ Alaska Fisheries Science Center, which does the bulk of the research on which fishery managers depend, was among the agencies that suffered deep budget and staffing cuts. 
The prospect of more cuts is unsettling, some officials said. “I guess now we’re getting to a point that I’m getting really concerned and almost freaked out about how much data that we’re potentially losing that we’re used to having,” Anne Vanderhoeven, a member of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, said on Dec. 4 during that body’s December meeting.
Even as the Trump administration cuts the support fishery management, it is demanding that the industry harvest more fish, in line with an administrative order issued by the president on April 17.
The federal government shutdown created more problems for fisheries managers, but the North Pacific Fishery Management Council used data from last year to set next year’s harvest limits for Alaska pollock — the nation’s top-volume commercial seafood — and other groundfish in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.

	Alaska’s seafood industry continues to endure a variety of economic challenges — competition in markets that are glutted, rising costs, declines of some important fish stock and labor shortages, among them. There are fewer people harvesting seafood commercially in Alaska than at any time on record.
Alaska legislators have tried to address some of those woes. A legislative task force made numerous recommendations about financial systems, marketing, industry diversification, workforce development and other subjects. Those recommendations produced a series of bills. Two of them passed during the 2025 session, gaining unanimous support, but Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed one of them, which would have shored up the Alaska Commercial Fishing and Agriculture Bank. The Legislature has the opportunity to address the subject again in the coming session.
The Dunleavy administration ran into trouble with two of its other fishery-related efforts. The governor introduced a bill that would legalize salmon farming, which is widely disdained in the state. The bill went nowhere. The administration is also continuing to try to overturn federal subsistence management on federal sections of the Kuskokwim River, but it has lost in court so far.
There were some notable improvements in 2025.
Bering Sea snow crab stocks are starting to rebound after a massive crash that closed harvests for two years, the first. However, there has been a puzzling boom in the number of snow-tanner crab hybrids. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game is treating the hybrids as snow crabs for harvest-management purposes.
The overall salmon harvest was much bigger and more lucrative than last year’s dismal totals. Bristol Bay reds were not as small as last year’s record tiny fish, and the region also had a bigger run than predicted. However, salmon runs in the Yukon River continue to be poor.
But trouble is brewing in the marine and freshwater environments that support fish.
In areas of thawing permafrost, particularly Northwestern Alaska, a phenomenon called “rusting rivers,” has released such high levels of metals that conditions at times are toxic for fish. The thaw creates acid rock drainage, similar to the type of pollution that can come from hardrock mining. Iron and other metals that are freed through the process turn clear waters orange or red. The problem is serious enough to have merited a chapter in this year’s Arctic Report Card, issued on Dec. 16 by NOAA.

	Alaska scientists have also confirmed that invasive northern pike, a bane to native salmon runs in Southcentral Alaska, can swim across Cook Inlet to colonize new territory. The freshwater pike, which gobble up salmon fry and other fish, are too entrenched in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough to be eradicated from waterways there. Biologists have been working to keep Kenai Peninsula pike-free and believed they were successful in 2018, until scientists discovered that pike are able to survive the relatively short swim through the inlet’s saltwater into new freshwater sites. The eradication work has continued, and state biologists believe the peninsula is again pike-free.
Another looming threat comes from the south. Resource managers with the Metlakatla Indian Community, the tribal government in Alaska’s most southeastern spot, have been battling what its officials term an “explosion” of invasive European green crabs. The first Alaska discovery of the invasive crabs, which can devastate native fish stocks, was in 2022 in the Metlakatla area. At first, there were only a few shells. But this year, workers in the tribal program trapped more than 40,000 of the crabs, which have been steadily expanding north.

A mental health clinician with a bullet-proof vest is helping change the way a Bay Area city responds to some of its emergency calls.
That’s what CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich found when she visited the San Mateo Police Department earlier this month to check out a new approach for mental health calls. 
The city was one of many that searched for a better way to help people in the throes of a mental health crisis. It participated in a 2021 pilot program from San Mateo County that paired law enforcement officers with mental health clinicians in four cities with the aim of freeing up police officers and avoiding unnecessary confrontations. 
Rather than police officers having to decide whether to arrest a person, send them to a hospital for a hold or leave them to their own devices, a paired clinician was deployed to provide additional measures such as safety planning, follow-up calls and community mental health resources. 
“I fill in the gaps,” said San Mateo Police Department mental health clinician Briana Fair, who builds relationships with people she calls clients and joins officers on some emergency calls.
Known as a “co-responder model,” the pilot appeared to work: Involuntary holds decreased about 17% and it reduced the chances of future mental health calls to 911, according to a new study by Stanford University. By reducing the number of involuntary detentions, researchers also estimated that the cities saved as much as $800,000 a year on health costs.

Mariela Ruiz-Angel, director of Alternative Response Initiatives at Georgetown Law’s Center for Innovations in Community Safety: “The idea was never about taking cops out of the equation altogether. The idea was that we don’t have to center them as the main response of 911. We don’t have to make public safety about cops. Public safety is about the appropriate response.”

Since the end of the two-year pilot, nearly all of San Mateo County cities have rolled out the co-responder model. Cities that participated in the pilot also found a way to sustain the program, including the police department in the city of San Mateo, which currently employs Fair and another part-time clinician.

Gun suicides in rural California

In rural California — where medical and mental health care can be hard to come by — firearm suicides particularly among older men are rattling communities and families who have been left behind, reports CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.
Rural counties in Northern California have some of the country’s highest rates of gun suicides among older adults. In Trinity County, for example, at least eight men 70 and older died from an apparent firearm suicide between 2020 and 2024. Over the course of 15 years, the gun suicide rate of adults in this age group in seven northern counties, including Trinity, was more than triple the statewide rate. 
In addition to owning more guns, residents in these areas have more limited access to medical and mental health services. When these services are farther away, people often remain in pain for longer because of missed or delayed appointments. In California, more than half of people 70 and over who died by gun suicide had a contributing physical health problem, and over a quarter had a diagnosed mental health condition.

Jake Ritter, on the death of his 81-year-old grandfather, Jeffrey Butler, who had health and pain issues and died in Trinity County in 2024 from a self-inflicted gunshot: “I’m sad that he didn’t get the help that he needed, and I’m sad that he felt so strongly that this is the road that he chose.”

New law to prevent sex abuse at schools

By July 2026 all California K-12 schools — including private schools — must have protocols in place to help protect schoolchildren from being sexually abused by educators, as directed by a new state law, writes CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
The law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, requires schools to enact a number of measures to rein in abuse and hold themselves accountable, including training students, teachers and other school staff to recognize signs of sexual grooming and report misconduct. 
The law’s most notable provision is the creation of a database that keeps track of teachers credibly accused of abuse. The database will be available to schools so that administrators can use it to vet prospective teachers. The database is intended to curb the practice of schools re-hiring teachers who have resigned from another school after being accused of sexual misconduct.

Re: How Gavin Newsom’s CARE Court lost its teeth in the California Legislature
The recent CalMatters article on how California’s CARE Court evolved in the Legislatureprovides in-depth coverage of the challenges counties face implementing constrained policy.
The California Association of Public Administrators, Public Guardians, and Public Conservators(CA PA|PG|PC) represents county officials who serve individuals with the most serious mentalillness, often when no family or support system is available.  Our members see the gap betweenCARE Court’s intent and real-world application.
Narrow diagnostic criteria, difficulty locating people experiencing unsheltered homelessness,and assumptions about outcomes all present obstacles. 
CARE Court is funded and can produce positive results in some cases. But failing CARE Court should not be treated as an automatic path to LPS conservatorship: the burden of proof remains high, and many people may not succeed in CARE Court for reasons unrelated to their ability to survive safely. 
Legislation must be judged by how it functions in practice for Californians statewide.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/10092023_CARE-Court_AH_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 08:58:23.863632

The law creates an array of measures to educate school staff, beef up reporting requirements and stop teachers credibly accused of abuse from getting jobs at other districts.


Facing a mountain of lawsuits, California K-12 schools will have a system in place beginning this year to prevent teachers and other staff from sexually abusing students.
A new California law creates an array of measures to educate school staff, beef up reporting requirements and stop teachers credibly accused of abuse from getting jobs at other districts.
The law, Senate Bill 848, goes into effect Jan. 1 and schools must have protocols in place by July. The law applies to all schools, including private schools.
“I’m proud to see this bill move forward. It’s been really personal for me,” state Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, the bill’s author, told CalMatters after it passed. “For survivors, this is an important step toward justice.”
Avalanche of lawsuits
The law stems from a previous California law that made it easier for victims to sue school districts and counties. Under AB 218, which went into effect in 2020, victims can file suit until age 40 or even older if they didn’t remember being abused until later in life. That’s led to an avalanche of lawsuits and much greater public awareness of the scope of the problem.
So far, victims have filed more than 1,000 lawsuits against school districts and counties, with some resulting in enormous payouts. A jury in Riverside County in 2023 handed Moreno Valley Unified a $135 million verdict over abuse allegations, and Los Angeles Unified faces more than $500 million in claims. 
Overall, California schools face nearly $3 billion in sex abuse claims from former students, according to the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, a state agency that helps school districts with financial matters. Some of the incidents occurred decades ago, as early as the 1940s, and some of the payouts have been so large that they’ve led districts to financial insolvency.
School accountability
While the new law doesn’t address the lawsuits, it does institute measures intended to stop future abuse and hold schools more accountable. It requires schools to write comprehensive policies on appropriate behavior, and train students, teachers, coaches and other school staff on recognizing and reporting misconduct. It also broadens the number of staff who are required to report abuse allegations.
Perhaps the most noteworthy requirement is creating a database of teachers credibly accused of abuse. The database, to be administered by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, will be available to schools during their hiring processes. The aim is to stop teachers who’ve abused students from quitting and getting rehired elsewhere, only to abuse more students. Teachers who’ve been cleared of wrongdoing will be removed from the database.
Pérez, a Democrat from Alhambra, said she was inspired to author the new law after reading about generations of abuse at Rosemead High School, which is in her district. She also told CaMatters that she was the victim of a teacher’s unwanted attention when she was in high school. 
“There are now dollars and cents being assigned to these cases,” she said in September. “It’s really opened up this conversation about what can we do to better prevent this abuse from happening.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/051122-School-MG-CM-29.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 08:58:23.863632
,California,2025-12-23 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Mayor Bass got some of LA’s homeless people indoors. Will it matter to voters?,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/la-mayor-bass-homelessness-reelection/,Homelessness numbers in Los Angeles are down but not enough for many voters to notice. It's also no longer the main issue of Karen Bass's reelection bid.,"Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass staked her political future on a promise: As a candidatein 2022, she vowed to make homelessness her top priority and to make dramaticreductions in the city’s population of unhoused people.
She won the campaign. To deliver on that promise, her first act as mayor was to sign Executive Directive 1, which was intended to streamline the construction of affordable housing and to signal the new administration’s urgency on the issue. She also rolled out Inside Safe, a program that breaks up homeless encampments and offers a safe alternative to those living inside them.
Three years later, as she enters the final year of her first term and embarks on hercampaign for re-election, Bass can point to real achievements in the homeless area, but shebattles a difficult perception problem: What if the number of homeless people in Los Angeles is down but not enough so that most Angelenos feel the problem is being solved?
There is evidence of progress. According to the mayor’s office, Inside Safe hasconducted 117 operations since Bass launched it, and it has brought 5,496 people infrom the streets. Of those, 1,321 have made their way to permanent housing. Othershave found temporary shelter or, sadly, have returned to the streets.
How much progress?
Against a citywide homeless population of more than 40,000 people, thosenumbers may seem incremental, but they are helping to reverse years of neglect. Thenumber of unsheltered homeless people — the focus of Bass’s work — has declined by17.5% since the mayor took office, according to the county’s annual count.
Austin Beutner, the former Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent who sofar is Bass’s most serious challenger in the mayor’s race, questions the numbers andclaims of progress. 
(Disclosure: I worked as a senior editor and columnist for the L.A. Times when Beutner was its publisher in 2014-15.)
Beutner points to a recent study by the RAND Corp. that sounded skeptical about Los Angeles County’s annual homeless count, suggesting it may significantly underestimate the extent of the area’s unhoused population.
The RAND study pointed to a rise in the number of so-called “rough sleepers,” peoplewho sleep on the street without even a tent or car which, it said, has caused the county’sannual homeless count to become increasingly inaccurate. That’s in part because rough sleepers are difficult to find and include in official tallies.
RAND attempted to check the county’s numbers by focusing on three areas — Venice,Hollywood and Skid Row — and comparing its count to the one produced by the LosAngeles Homeless Services Agency.
The results, according to RAND, suggest that LAHSA is missing large numbers of unsheltered people. But even the RAND report noted that the number of people without shelter in its study areas was falling, sometimes dramatically.
In 2024, RAND found, the number of people without housing in its study area dropped by 15%.In Hollywood, the decline was 49%.
That’s not enough to declare victory against the scourge of homelessness, but it’shardly the basis for declaring failure.
Complicating matters further are the relentless facts of politics and the strains theyput on any holder of the LA mayor’s office. No matter how much a mayor sets out toconcentrate on a single issue, life intervenes, throwing up new challenges anddistractions.
In Bass’s case, the past year sent two big ones her way: the wildfires that destroyedlarge swaths of the Pacific Palisades, within Bass’s area of responsibility, and Altadena,outside it. And then there was President Donald Trump’s decision to turn Los Angelesinto the testing ground for his demonization of immigrants and militarization of Americanlife.
A shifting focus
Either of those could have upended Bass’s focus on homelessness, and it’s true that newscoverage of the mayor has largely moved off the issue that brought her to office.
As she enters her re-election campaign, critics are more likely to focus on her halting reply tothe fires, while supporters point most eagerly to her dogged resistance to Trump.In political terms, both issues may prove offsetting, as the fires highlighted what someregard as the mayor’s administrative weaknesses while the Trump assault remindedvoters she has served as a bulwark against a deeply reviled president and hislegion of not-very-bright minions.
As 2026 opens, the Palisades are rebuilding, and the troops dispatched by Trump to putdown non-existent riots have returned to homes and bases.
Homelessness persists.

That then frames a central question of this mayor’s race: Has Bass done enough toaddress the shameful reality of a city that boasts extravagant wealth and yet tens of thousands of its people sleep without shelter?
That, too, is politically complicated, in part because measuring the problem is only onepiece of its politics. It may not be enough for Bass to tell voters that they should behappy with the city’s progress, because the annual count shows the problem slowlyebbing or because RAND found huge progress in Hollywood.
What really matters is how most people come into contact with homelessness. In that sense, homelessness as a political issue resembles inflation. It does little good for a politician to tell voters that they should be happy with the economy if they’re not.
Joe Biden learned that the hard way, and Trump is busy learning it today. Everytime President Trump dismisses “affordability” as a “hoax” or a Democratic scheme, it backfires with voters who feel pressed by rising prices or stagnant wages.
Hence Trump’s march into the dark abyss of public disapproval.
Similarly, it’s not enough for Bass to insist that fewer people are homeless than werethree years ago, if voters don’t sense that for themselves. If there’s an encampment onthe corner, it hardly matters that there are 49% fewer unhoused men and women inHollywood. Homelessness still feels present.
That may turn out to be this campaign’s wildcard. If voters feel that their ownneighborhoods are better, it will land as proof that Bass is making headway anddeserves four more years to complete the work she began with Executive Directive 1.
If not, Beutner or some other candidate may get the chance to finish what she started.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/092624-Karen-Bass-Homeless-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C673&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 08:58:23.863632

Ashley McClure is an East Bay physician who cofounded Climate Health Now



For nine years, I’ve practiced primary care medicine in the East Bay, taking care of people from all walks of life. Lately, I’ve noticed a troubling pattern in my exam rooms: more young people needing asthma inhalers, more middle-aged patients developing new seasonal allergies that get worse every year as temperatures rise, and more elderly patients struggling through wildfire season and heat waves. 
I’ve watched parents miss work to care for children whose asthma flares up during poor air quality days. I’ve counseled pregnant women about the risks of air pollution exposure. 
These aren’t just statistics in a medical journal. They’re my patients — real people whose health is suffering because of oil and gas-related pollution and the global warming it’s causing.  
We know that fossil fuel related air pollution is responsible for 1 out of 5 deaths worldwide each year. As a physician, I strongly oppose the Trump administration’s proposed plan to give private corporations leases for new oil and gas drilling on our public and federal lands in 17 California counties, up and down the state.
Trump’s Bureau of Land Management is preparing new resource management plans that could pave the way for expanded oil and gas drilling across more than one million acres of California public lands — from the San Joaquin Valley all the way up the Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area. The recent draft of the Environmental Impact Report kicked off a 30-day public comment period when the public can get involved. (It’s a Scroogey timing, to be sure).
This plan is the next front in President Donald Trump’s full-fledged assault on our public lands and the next step in his “drill, baby, drill” agenda. If approved, this plan could lock in decades of new toxic oil drilling in wild spaces that should be open to all, or near frontline communities who already live with the deadly impacts of air pollution, water contamination, and environmental injustice. 
This year California’s air quality report card shows a failing grade for many counties, with 98% of the state’s population experiencing unhealthy air at some point during the year, according to the American Lung Association’s “State of the Air” 2025 report. It will absolutely get worse if we allow the Trump administration’s land management plans to move forward.  
Public lands belong to all Americans. They should promote our health, not undermine it. These are the places families visit to breathe clean air, where watersheds begin, where ecosystems provide natural buffers against climate impacts.  
With enough political opposition we can absolutely stop Trump and his oil lobby besties from pillaging and plundering our natural public lands. Objectors just did it in the Southeast USin late October. Concerned environmentalists and some Republican stakeholders who were worried offshore drilling would harm tourism were successful in protecting their waters. 
Now it’s our turn. This is the moment for California’s elected leaders to stand up and fiercely oppose the plans Trump and his oily campaign funders before the drilling starts. 
Our public lands should be a source of health, recreation, and resilience; not another source of the dirty pollution making my patients sick. Protecting public lands from oil and gas drilling isn’t just environmental policy; it’s preventive medicine. It’s choosing a future where I spend less time treating pollution-related illness and more time helping patients thrive.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/070723-Yosemite-National-Park-MG-CM-15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 08:58:23.863632

Maura Healey’s agenda around energy issues.,"THE CLIMATE STORY written in Massachusetts this year was, depending on your perspective, an instant classic or a nightmare. 
It had intrigue. It had personalities. It had political posturing. And it sure had long-term repercussions for the Bay State’s vision of a green economy and its preparations for the impacts of climate change. 
2025 started with a turbocharged shakeup of the climate and energy landscape. After taking office in January, President Trump quickly used his power to pull funding for clean energy and energy efficiency initiatives and to stop additional offshore wind permits. 
Many Massachusetts residents also saw their winter gas bills skyrocket, prompting widespread anger and calls for relief. Elected officials began shifting the discourse – and their attention – toward energy affordability, which opened up an intense debate about the cause of the high costs. The Department of Public Utilities, in fact, recently opened an investigation into all charges on gas and electric bills. 
Those frustrations drove Gov. Maura Healey’s agenda around energy issues the rest of the year as she fashioned herself as an “all of the above” supporter on energy. And these dynamics teed up a host of policy fights as the state looks to thread an increasingly delicate needle: how to meet rising power demand, bring down utility bills, and meet the ambitious climate commitments that require dramatically cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  
CommonWealth Beacon chronicled these storylines and more throughout the year. Here is your 2025 climate and energy recap. 
Healey’s energy affordability bill 
Healey’s main vehicle for addressing the state’s high energy costs that drew outrage last winter is the energy affordability bill she filed in May. The legislation seeks to empower the Department of Public Utilities to remove charges from bills, bring more energy onto the grid, remove barriers to the development of nuclear power, and change how Mass Save is financed. 
What came next rattled Beacon Hill, brought advocates swarming to the State House, and divided the Democratic supermajority.  
CommonWealth Beacon exclusively reported on a plan hatched by Rep. Mark Cusack, the Democratic chair of the House energy committee, to use Healey’s legislation to weaken the state’s 2030 climate commitments in the name of energy affordability. Cusack also proposed cutting the Mass Save budget and reducing the amount of renewable energy that utilities are required to procure. Cusack, who received campaign donations from the utilities right around the time he filed his bill, then pushed the measure through his committee in the final days of session before House leadership ultimately punted the issue to next year. 
Insurance 
What’s happening in the insurance industry is increasingly a climate story since insurers are the ultimate arbiters of risk.  
As home insurers raise rates and end policies in the face of growing climate risk and high rebuilding costs due to inflation and tariffs, new data show that more Massachusetts homeowners are enrolling in the insurer of last resort, or the FAIR Plan. Last year saw the first single-year increase in FAIR Plan policies since 2017 and the largest jump in two decades after high nonrenewal rates in 2023 likely drove more people to look elsewhere for home coverage. 
There are also significant changes when it comes to flood insurance, which is typically not covered under a home insurance policy and is a market largely run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. New flood maps across the state threaten to place more residents in the flood zone, requiring them to buy additional insurance. And in Boston, flood-prone residents have had to pay an additional $785,000 in flood insurance charges since 2021 because the city missed its goal to join a FEMA program that offers discounts on premiums — triggering new urgency from city councilors.  
Energy supply in Trump 2.0 
Offshore wind across the Northeast stalled in 2025 under a Republican trifecta in Washington that was ushered in by last year’s election. Trump started the year by threatening to stop wind projects already under construction and swiftly took action to block new permits, and ended the year on a similar note, this time taking aim at Vineyard Wind, the lone offshore wind project currently delivering power to Massachusetts. The Healey administration also proposed to delay a statutory offshore wind procurement requirement intended to keep the state on track to meet its climate commitments.  
Struggles in the offshore wind industry also showed up in other ways: Shortly after Trump took office, a wind cable manufacturing company pulled its project despite winning state support. And CommonWealth Beacon reported that no company has claimed $35 million in state offshore wind tax credits offered in 2023 and 2024, even before Trump had returned to the White House. 
The Trump administration also targeted solar power, canceling $156 million in solar funding for Massachusetts. There is one bright spot, though. The delayed Hydro-Quebec line bringing hydropower from Quebec into New England is on track to start delivering power next year. 
Resilience 
Healey’s other big environmental legislative package unveiled this year is her nearly $3 billion bond bill, which will likely see action in the Legislature in 2026. The measure seeks to improve bridges, dams, culverts, and other critical pieces of infrastructure to better guard against floods, streamline restoration projects, and create a fund to finance similar initiatives in the future.  
The bill would also force Massachusetts property owners for the first time to disclose their flood history when selling. The Bay State is one of just 14 that doesn’t require flood risk disclosures. The proposal is widely praised as one that will provide prospective homebuyers with the information they need to evaluate the flood risk of a property, but there’s concern that the influential real estate industry could serve as a roadblock to the provision.  
The state is confronting the complications of flooding in other ways, too, and going directly at what once was a third rail. Environmental officials are formally calling on Massachusetts to establish a voluntary buyout program for residential properties at risk of being consumed by rising seas.  
Massachusetts regulators didn’t enforce their own climate rule 
CommonWealth Beacon reported exclusively on court documents filed earlier this year that show that state agencies didn’t follow a 2017 climate rule and that the state Department of Environmental Protection didn’t enforce it, either. The rule requires agencies to report on and reduce the emissions of their state-owned vehicles, but the DEP said in court filings connected to a lawsuit that the state brought against Exxon that they haven’t received any such agency reports and didn’t take any enforcement action to comply with the regulation. 
The rule came about in response to a landmark lawsuit brought by the Conservation Law Foundation and other groups, in which a court in 2016 found that the state needed to issue more specific regulations to meet the 2050 climate commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10_14-Tepper_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 08:58:23.863632

(File)The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals Friday upheld a lower court’s dismissal of a lawsuit that alleged that inmates were being forced to labor in involuntary servitude in violation of the state constitution.
The three plaintiffs, currently incarcerated by the Alabama Department of Corrections, said in the lawsuit that they were assigned additional work duties without pay and lost phone and canteen access; visitation hours and good-time credits, while receiving unfavorable disciplinary reports.
The court affirmed the Montgomery Circuit Court’s decision, which found the plaintiffs that court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to decide the issue and that the people currently incarcerated lacked standing to file the complaint because they have not accrued any correctional incentive time that they could lose.

“None of the other punishments the prisoners alleged … constitute involuntary servitude because they do not involve the use of physical coercion, the threat of physical coercion, or the use of or the threat of coercion through law or the legal process,” the ruling states.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs criticized the decision.
“We’re deeply disappointed in this decision,” said C.J. Sandley, senior staff attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, who is representing the plaintiffs. “The court failed to recognize that punishing incarcerated people for refusing to work indeed violates the state constitution’s ban on involuntary servitude and slavery. Our courageous clients will continue to fight for the rights of incarcerated workers.”
Alabama voters in 2022 approved a wide-ranging recompilation of the 1901 Constitution that struck out a passage allowing slavery or involuntary servitude “otherwise than for the punishment of crime, of which the party shall have been duly convicted.”
The plaintiffs are part of a voluntary work release program that pays them while also assisting with “housekeeping” duties in their respective prisons, from cleaning the cells and picking up garbage to working in the cafeteria.
The lawsuit alleges that ADOC punished them for refusing to work and arriving late for work, as well as “complaining about unsafe working conditions.” The plaintiffs argued that EO 725, an executive order from Gov. Kay Ivey outlining rules for correctional incentive time, and AR 403, a modification of those rules by ADOC Commissioner John Hamm, violated the new constitutional language adopted in 2022.
“The prisoners assert that EO 725 and AR 403 violate Article I, § 32, of the current Alabama Constitution because, the prisoners allege, ‘they require and enforce slavery and involuntary servitude,’” the ruling states.
The Montgomery Circuit Court ruled in favor of the Alabama Attorney General’s Office, which argued that the case should be dismissed because the court did not have jurisdiction to decide the matter, and that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they did not have correctional incentive credits to challenge.
The appeals court said the term “involuntary servitude” means “a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury, or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the legal process.”
“None of the punishments the prisoners alleged were imposed by EO 725 and AR 403 for the prisoners’ refusal to work involved physical acts or the threat of physical acts to compel them to work,” the ruling states. “There were no allegations that the prisoners would be beaten or otherwise physically abused if they refused to work or that they would be threatened with physical harm if they refused to work. Moreover, the prisoners did not allege that they would be coerced through law or the legal process if they refused to work.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Gate-2019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

At Northern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services, the vacancy rate is 31%. (Photo: Getty Images)Northern Nevada’s state-run behavioral health system is heavily reliant on contracted workers as it continues to struggle to fill its vacant positions, lawmakers were told last week.
Managers from the state Department of Human Services appeared before the Interim Finance Committee to request the transfer of $1.8 million from its personnel budget line, which covers employee salaries, to its professional services budget line, which covers people working under contracts.
Julie Lindesmith, the manager for Northern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services, told lawmakers the agency has been unable to fill vacancies for licensed professionals.
NNAMHS’ overall employee vacancy rate is 31%, which they’ve brought down from 36% two years ago. However, the vacancy rate for psychiatric nurse positions is 50%, and the vacancy rate for licensed clinical social workers is 55%.
“We have been making great successes in recruiting,” said Lindesmith. “In fact, we even had a psychiatrist come over from contract to a state position. However, it is still difficult to hire psychiatric nurses and licensed clinical social workers.”
As a result, contracted positions are needed to maintain required staffing ratios.
The money transferred by IFC is expected to cover contracted workers until February. NNAMHS is expected to have to appear before the legislative money committee again in April, as it is projecting a budget shortfall. But Lindesmith told lawmakers the agency is attempting to find budget savings.
No internal wage study has been conducted to compare the state’s salary and benefits to other employers within the industry, according to Lindesmith. Recruitment efforts have included community outreach events and mailing flyers to everybody on the state’s licensure list.
Contract workers earn a higher hourly wage but do not receive employee benefits. Lindesmith said many only work one or two days a week for the state. Some who do work 40 hours prefer a schedule (like working four 10-hour shifts) that the state cannot offer due to its collective bargaining agreement.
The Department of Human Services currently has an overall vacancy rate around 15%, according to its website.
Within the department, the Division of Child and Family Services has the highest vacancy rate: 24%. The Division of Public and Behavioral Health, which includes NNAMHS, has a vacancy rate of 21%. The Division of Social Services has the lowest vacancy rate: 9.7%.
Over half of the vacancies across the department are in positions related to medical, health, social services or rehabilitation. Along with psychiatric nurses, mental health technicians, mental health counselors, family services specialists and social workers are listed as the positions with the highest vacancies.
The State of Nevada has been working to lower its employee vacancy rate across all departments and has seen success. Gov. Joe Lombardo announced lowering the vacancy rate as a priority when he took office in 2023 and quickly issued several executive orders aimed at reducing barriers to state employment. Retention bonuses were also awarded to employees that year.
In March 2025, The Nevada Independent reported the state’s total vacancy rate had been cut in half. But vacancy rates within some departments, including the Nevada Department of Corrections and Department of Human Services, have remained stubbornly high.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/behavioral-therapy-mental-health-GettyImages-1140393669-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

(Screenshot of Colleton County government livestream)Information is emerging about the massive data center that is proposed near Green Pond in Colleton County by Eagle Rock Partners.
The project got its first public airing in a zoning meeting Dec. 18. This Colleton proposal has significant implications for policies that must be enacted to protect the public interest throughout our state as data centers proliferate like wildfire.
Defense of the project by Ken Loeber of Eagle Rock has been unconvincing.
As reported by Jessica Holdman in the SC Daily Gazette on Dec. 19, “Loeber told the SC Daily Gazette he estimates the center will need 1,000 megawatts of electricity. That would take up nearly all of Santee Cooper’s share of a 2,200-megawatt, natural gas-fired power plant that the state-owned utility company is seeking to build, in partnership with Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy, in nearby Canadys.”
Gigawatt data center proposal draws opposition from SC Lowcountry residents, politicians

Meanwhile, Dylan Nolan at Fitsnews reported on Dec. 19 that Loeber also said that “The simple fact is your [energy] rates are not going up due to this project.”
He appears to base that claim on his statement that “those [energy infrastructure projects] are projects that are being done regardless of whether we come to Colleton County or not.”
But why are they planned? It has been conceded by utilities that the rapid development of massive energy demands by data centers underlies much of the pressure to increase generating capacity.
Santee Cooper officials have placed the number at about 70% of the expansion at Canadys.
Loeber’s figures would place that percentage even higher, at more than 80% for this single project. This is not a case of more efficient use of existing capacity.
Utilities are planning to build specifically to meet data center needs.
The numbers in this case are daunting. Canadys is expected to cost $5 billion, of which $2.5 billion will be assigned to Santee Cooper. Pipeline extensions are expected to add at least $430 million to this total.
Unless the General Assembly acts quickly and decisively to demand that data centers pay in full for construction of the generating and transmission capacity that they will use, residential and small business ratepayers will be forced to absorb too much of that cost.
Santee Cooper, to its great credit, has established a large user rate that would help to mitigate this.
However, secondary distributors of Santee Cooper energy, like the co-op serving the proposed project area, are not obligated to do the same. Thus, data center builders can waltz in after a generating plant is underway and claim their right to be served, receiving much of the output at rates lower than those charged to residential and small business users.
Of course, if Eagle Rock is planning to assume Santee Cooper’s share of costs for building generation and transmission capacity in proportion to their planned use of that energy, none of this would be problematic.
Here’s what SC landowners should expect from a proposed 71-mile natural gas pipeline

Loeber conspicuously did not offer that clarification, and he surely would have if that was planned.
Instead, he offered comments that appear to be designed to evade that responsibility.
Hundreds of thousands of South Carolinians must pay their energy bills and then decide whether they can afford their medicine and their food.
Often the answer is only one of those, or neither.
All of us must pay energy bills or live in the dark and the cold.
Who will benefit from our payments, given current law and practices? Immensely wealthy corporations like Amazon and Google.
What Loeber is effectively saying is that our paying for much of the energy expansion that his company would need is already planned, and if his company doesn’t swoop in and take advantage of us, others will.
I don’t think I am alone in finding this small and unsatisfactory consolation. This is only one of the many reasons that the Eagle Rock data center proposal should die a rapid death.
However, it should be of major concern to small business and residential ratepayers and to public officials in Colleton County and at the Statehouse, both for this data center proposal and those that will come in the future.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-3.32.29 PM-e1766176660315-1024x573.png,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

Businesses and Missouri lawmakers are scrambling to understand what will happen in November, when new federal limits on intoxicating hemp products go into effect.
It’s unclear just how proactive the federal government will be enforcing the new restrictions. Will it clamp down, or like it has with marijuana, look the other way as states enact their own rules?  
To add to the uncertainty, President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana. That action could impact whether or not the feds choose to enforce hemp products as well, according to a congressional report.
Amidst the swirling questions, several Missouri lawmakers have pre-filed bills for the upcoming legislative session that begins in January to establish state regulations on intoxicating hemp products. 
Not all of the Missouri proposals include the federal THC limit in their definitions of hemp, which will take effect Nov. 12 and was included in a  federal spending package approved by Congress and signed by the president in November. 
One proposal that does align with the federal restrictions comes from Republican state Sen. David Gregory of Chesterfield, and it would regulate intoxicating hemp the same as marijuana. That would essentially ban current hemp products, because marijuana must be grown in Missouri and most hemp currently is grown outside of the state. It would also require hemp products to be sold in licensed cannabis dispensaries, where most are currently sold in gas stations, liquor stores and restaurants and smoke shops. 
Republican state Rep. Matthew Overcast of Ava said he has “no concerns” about the federal language impacting the hemp industry. He plans on continuing to push his proposed constitutional amendment that would overturn the current regulatory framework for the cannabis industry and instead allow marijuana and intoxicating hemp products to be sold in the same stores as alcohol and tobacco. 
“Historically, there’s been this softened congressional enforcement of our federally illicit marijuana programs that have regulated programs across the nation,” he said. “Even if the language were to stand, I don’t see — outside of big marijuana continuing to try to influence congressional and state legislators and state agencies — that we’re going to see federal enforcement on hemp.”
Democratic state Sen. Karla May of St. Louis pre-filed a bill that would allow intoxicating hemp products to continue to be sold outside of dispensaries with a $1,000 registration fee annually. Her bill does not include the federal definition, she said, because it was drafted before the spending package went through. May called her bill a “starting point.”
Through it all, intoxicating hemp businesses — along with companies that assist them — are trying to figure out what their future might look like. 
“Think about your bank, your payroll company, your merchant processor — they may not want to wait out the 365 days,” said Jessica Velazquez, a Las Vegas-based accountant with Beach Fleishman, during a November webinar for hemp businesses. “They may take a more conservative approach and say, ‘Hey, you know, this really is like [marijuana] and maybe we don’t want to service you anymore’ in the way that they currently are now.’”
 What is the law?

Hemp and marijuana are essentially terms the government uses to distinguish between the part of the cannabis plant that has high amounts of THC.
Hemp has previously been defined as any part of the plant containing 0.3% or less delta-9 THC by dry weight.
Last month, a provision in the federal spending bill amended the definition of hemp, changing the limit to a total THC concentration of less than .3% on a dry weight basis, rather than only delta-9 THC. It also prohibits products from containing more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container.
The changes address some of the concerns Congress heard from groups like the Cannabis Regulators Association, which represents state marijuana regulators across the nation.
The association submitted information to Congress in a 2023 report stating that many hemp businesses are selling “THCA hemp” flower, or buds, containing less than 0.3% delta-9 THC. 
“However, cannabis plants produce THCA, not THC,” the report states. 
(Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).
When the plant is smoked, the THCA converts or decarboxylates into delta-9 THC – and that’s why every state marijuana program defines THC in terms of both THCA and delta-9 THC, regulators said.  
THCA products – including flower, vape cartridges and concentrates – are “indistinguishable” from marijuana products sold in dispensaries, the association stated.
And that’s why, regulators argued, there was a need to add language about total THC, instead of only delta-9.
Regarding weight, the association told Congress that the threshold of 0.3% delta-9 THC by weight is a small amount of THC in a hemp plant. However, when applied to things like chocolate bars or beverages that can weigh significantly more, 0.3% by weight can amount to hundreds of milligrams of THC.
The association gave the example of a 50-gram chocolate bar at 0.3% THC would have around 150 mg of THC — 30 times the standard 5 mg THC dose established by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. A family sized pack of cookies weighing 20 oz can contain around 1,700 mg of THC using the 0.3% THC threshold.
“The whole question was: what is hemp and what is marijuana?” said Jack Cardetti, spokesman for the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association. “There was not a bright line there, and it was a line that obviously some bad actors have used to push intoxicating products that were completely unregulated.”
The lack of government oversight on these products makes them a public health risk, Cardetti said. Now there is a “clear bright line,” he said, and he believes a majority of Missouri lawmakers will want to align with the federal definition.
The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee stated the changes were made to prevent “the unregulated sale of intoxicating” hemp products.
A report from the Congressional Research Service released this month states that it “remains to be seen” whether the FDA will opt to try and remove the products from the market or not.
The FDA and DEA, in coordination with the Department of Justice, “have a range of civil and criminal remedies they may use in efforts to exercise control over these activities,” it states.
It also says these federal agencies, “may lack the resources to broadly enforce the laws prohibiting intoxicating hemp products on the market.”
Congress may also choose to exercise oversight over federal enforcement priorities regarding state-regulated cannabis activities, the report says. It took that step with medical marijuana, when it prohibited spending money on enforcement.
“Congress can say that, ‘FDA and DEA, we prohibit you from using federal dollars to enforce against state-compliant hemp programs,’” said Craig Small, a Denver-based cannabis attorney. 
With the federal limits, Small said hemp companies could run into the same banking and tax issues that marijuana companies do — where there are no business tax deductions allowed and banks largely won’t take them as customers. 
How much priority federal agencies need to put on enforcing hemp-derived products seemed to be a “subtext” of Trump’s executive order to reschedule marijuana, Small said. 
It ordered his administration to work with Congress to develop a framework that permits full-spectrum CBD products, which have a trace amount of THC. Those products “will once again be controlled as marijuana,” under the federal spending bill’s provision, the executive order states. 
However, it also states the regulatory framework should preserve Congress’ “intent to restrict the sale of products that pose serious health risks.”
And it orders federal health agencies to “develop research methods and models utilizing real-world evidence to improve access to hemp-derived cannabinoid products.” 
“It does signal to the industry that if we were on a DEFCON 1 before, we’re now on DEFCON 3,” Small said. “Whatever arguments law enforcement want to make on a federal or state level about the danger of these products and how serious it is that we get them off the streets, I do think that’s lessened a little bit with these instructions.”
 Lawmakers weigh in

This will be the fourth year in a row that Missouri lawmakers have attempted to regulate intoxicating hemp products, with previous debates ending in stalemates. 
May said she’s planning on sitting down with Gregory to talk about how to move forward this legislative session. 
“We really want to solve the issue,” May said. “That’s the key, so I want to make sure that everybody’s on the same page saying the same thing.”
Under May’s bill, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services would be tasked with establishing rules on potency limits, recall procedures of dangerous products, advertising standards and “create mechanisms for compliance and enforcement.”
May led a seven-hour bipartisan filibuster in April against a bill similar to Gregory’s, after arguing it was nothing more than an attempt by the marijuana industry to stomp out its competition. 
“It reminds me so much of a street drug war,” May said during an April Senate floor debate. “All drugs have always been about distribution and territory. And this is no different.”
Sen. Karla May, a Democrat from St. Louis, debates an intoxicating hemp bill by Sen. Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican, in the Missouri Senate in April (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The department has previously put a high price tag on proposals that create separate rules for intoxicating hemp and marijuana products. 
Republican state Rep. Dave Hinman of O’Fallon led a similar effort as May to license hemp business during the last legislative session, but he said he will file a bill that aligns with the new federal definition.
Overcast’s constitutional amendment would replace the marijuana legalization amendment approved by voters in 2022 with language that instructs Missouri lawmakers to create regulations that are no more burdensome than what we already have for alcohol and tobacco. 
The amendment is nearly identical to four initiative petitions filed in September and bankrolled by American Shaman owner Vince Sanders and some other major hemp business owners. While the petitions have been approved to circulate for signatures, the effort has been put on pause, said Eapen Thampy, a lobbyist for American Shaman.
“Although we were successful at securing some commitments,” Thampy said, “it wasn’t to the level where we felt comfortable moving forward with a full fledged signature campaign.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Slaphappy-Hemp-scaled-e1762889871439-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

DemasA group of volunteers seeking to preserve and connect people with the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park has opened applications for its artists in residence program, offering creatives an opportunity to immerse themselves in the wilderness of the Upper Peninsula and channel it into their work.
The Friends of the Porkies Artist-in-Residence program is open to writers, composers and all visual and performing artists, offering them the use of a rustic cabin on the Little Union River for a minimum of two weeks, and a three-night backcountry campaign permit, if requested. As part of the residency, artists will also provide a public presentation demonstrating an aspect of their work. 
Located in the western Upper Peninsula, the park encompasses 60,000 acres, including 35,000 acres of old-growth forest, as well as waterfalls, rivers and 25 miles of Lake Superior shoreline. 
According to Friends of the Porkies, the goal of the program is “To offer residencies to new and established artists of recognized excellence from around the world to pursue their creative process in a wilderness environment.”
Applications for the program can be found at the Friends of the Porkies web page at Porkies.org/Artist-in-Residence. Applications for the 2026 season must be received by Feb. 14, 2026 and selected artists will be notified mid-April.
According to a news release from the Department of Natural Resources, selection for the program will be based on their artistic integrity, ability to reside in a wilderness environment, their ability to relate to and interpret the park through their art, as well as their willingness to donate an original, finished piece of art inspired by their stay.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_1761-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

She says she was not informed of an upcoming appointment in the mail until after the appointment passed – a reality she worries will be the new normal for many families now that the federal government mandated more red tape for the program. 
“And then that puts you in a position where now you have to recertify completely, and you got to turn in extra paperwork, and now you have to wait til they work your case back up, and now you’re behind on getting food,” Williams said. 
Stricter work requirements for food stamps went into effect in November, putting 33,000 Mississippians at risk of losing their benefits, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. The new work requirements were signed into law by President Donald Trump over the summer, alongside a major reduction in federal funding for food assistance. The cuts will hit Mississippi harder than many states because of the state’s high poverty and hunger rates. 
Mississippi will have to pay the price for its high error rates in eligibility determinations. That rate measures how accurately each state determines if a person is eligible to receive benefits, and states with error rates over 10% will have to pay the maximum 15% in benefits. That, in addition to administrative costs, means Mississippi will have to put up about $140 million in costs previously covered by the federal government to run its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the next two years. The new costs will drastically affect the state’s priorities, experts say. 
The temporary loss of food aid from the recent government shutdown – and its immediate effect on hunger – showed the country how many Americans live paycheck to paycheck and rely on the nation’s largest anti-hunger program, said Theresa Lau, senior policy counsel at the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
“We saw a lot of families really struggling to make ends meet,” Lau said. “What we learned is you can’t ‘food bank’ your way out of this crisis.”

About 1 in 8 Mississippians — nearly 400,000 people  — receive food assistance through SNAP. More than 67% of participants are in households with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT. 
Mississippi is one of 15 states where SNAP expenditures will rise more than 300% as a result of the new law, according to the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality. Twenty-three governors signed a letter to Congressional leadership stating they may be forced to end their state SNAP programs and outlining the harm this would do to their constituents, but Gov. Tate Reeves was not one of them. 
The Mississippi Department of Human Services, responsible for implementing the state’s SNAP program, is already bracing for this change. In September, Bob Anderson, head of the department, asked the Legislature for $15 million to cover the administrative portion of the program. Meanwhile, Anderson stayed quiet on child care requests despite more than 19,000 families having lost access to vouchers that made child care affordable since pandemic-era funds dried up. 
Last year, before mounting SNAP costs created greater strain on the state’s budget, Anderson asked the Legislature for $15 million to make a dent in the growing waitlist for child care vouchers. 
“SNAP currently serves around 350,000 Mississippians while child care (serves) around 24,000,” Chief Communications Officer Mark Jones told Mississippi Today. “Unfortunately, tough decisions must be made in preparing a budget.”
Experts expect these kinds of priority equations to become more common in the coming years. 
“That’s something we’re very worried about as states try to balance their budgets and have these millions of dollars they need to put up in order to get federal SNAP dollars,” Lau said.
Do work requirements work?
Work requirements already exist for the SNAP program, but the new federal law will expand them to people previously exempt: adults aged 55 to 65 and parents of children aged 14 and older. Everyone subject to the requirements will have to prove they are working, going to school or training at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for one of the exemptions. 
About three-quarters of SNAP beneficiaries work or are in between jobs, and another 20% are attending school, taking care of a family member, or have a health condition or disability, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Opponents of the reporting requirements say the policy doesn’t take into consideration the barriers keeping people from steady employment, such as low pay, discrimination, and lack of paid parental leave and affordable health insurance. 
“Work requirements don’t improve job outcomes, they just take food away from people,” said Lau. “In rural areas where jobs are very limited, work reporting requirements often force people to volunteer in order to qualify and essentially what that means is they’re providing unpaid labor.”
They are also costly to implement and often cause eligible beneficiaries to be kicked off because of administrative errors – something that already happens. 
Amaya Jones, a Jackson mom of two who works full-time at Kroger, said her caseworker recently told her she would have to submit SNAP paperwork via mail rather than online, only to later be told the office never received it. Jones said she believes they do things like this “to make it harder” for people to get assistance. 
“They want you to send things by mail, they claim they don’t get it, you go in and the people give you attitude,” Jones said. “It’s the communication. One minute you have this caseworker, and the next it’s another caseworker. You don’t know if you’re going or coming.”

When Mississippi’s Medicaid office began its “unwinding” process in 2023 – reviewing its rolls for the first time since the pandemic – 75% of the dropped enrollees lost coverage due to “procedural errors.” Now, experts think Mississippians will live to see a similar trend with the state’s SNAP program. 
The added burden of red tape will be exacerbated by aging technology that fails to support these administrative overhauls, resulting in qualified people losing access to food, explained Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Tax and Income Supports Division at the Urban Institute. 
“We’re up now against the fact that a lot of states have not really been able to fully upgrade their technology in a way that helps them manage things nimbly,” Waxman explained. “Replacing your state’s administrative systems is usually not high on any legislator’s list of priorities, but we do pay the price for that later.”
Between the immediate administrative costs and the roughly $120 million Mississippi will have to pitch in for benefits next fiscal year, Waxman said the state cannot rule out the possibility of having to close the program altogether. 
“We would expect to see very high levels of hardship, higher rates of poverty and poorer health outcomes,” said Waxman. “Local stores and producers would also experience negative consequences because there would be far fewer dollars available to buy their products. And the charitable food system wouldn’t be able to fully fill the gap, even for a short time.”
Not only are food banks not equipped to take up the slack for a scenario as catastrophic as the end of a state’s SNAP program, but they also can’t offer the freedom of choice or the selection of healthy meats and produce that supermarkets do. 
Schelika Chisolm runs Tupelo’s Salvation Army branch with her husband, Michael Chisolm. She’s organized the food in a way that people can shop for what they want, because she knows it boosts morale and makes life easier for people with allergies and parents of small children. 
“It’s about being able to feel like there’s something you can control and something you can make a choice about,” Chisholm said. “You feel happy to know that what you have in your cart is something your kids will eat.”
But she said she still can’t offer the variety of fresh and healthy foods that a supermarket does. Many food pantries don’t offer people any choice, giving out pre-packed boxes for efficiency. Chisolm said she hopes the SNAP program continues to be as accessible as possible for those trapped in cycles of poverty. 
“Those that are in need already have barriers they’re trying to overcome, whether it’s transportation, working a minimum wage job, trying to provide for multiple people in your home or taking care of an elderly parent – they already have barriers,” Chisholm said. “I hope we don’t make it less possible for them to complete the process.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/05140357/3X0A2282.jpg,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

CalMatters produced a nonpartisan voter guide for the Prop. 50 special election, and brought it to more readers across the state thanks to newsroom partners.


CalMatters was already planning its coverage of the 2026 midterm and gubernatorial elections when, in August, the California Legislature approved Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal for a surprise special election on Proposition 50. Our team of reporters, editors, data journalists, developers and more dug right in to bring people all over California a trustworthy, nonpartisan guide to Prop. 50.
“Soon after I joined CalMatters/The Markup, we started planning our 2026 election coverage,” said CalMatters Director of Product Andrew Losowsky. “Then Proposition 50 was announced, and suddenly the next election was 11 weeks away. I’m so proud of how we all responded.”
Our team started with two hallmark CalMatters election resources: our nonpartisan, clear and trustworthy Voter Guide on our site, and our day-to-day Prop. 50 news coverage.
Then, we got to work on new ways to reach new audiences:

The same day that the proposed district changes came out, we created and published a searchable map so you could find out if your district would change. We also highlighted, using maps, the districts most impacted by redistricting. 
When Prop 50 was announced, we asked “How do you feel about it?” and more than 1,800 of you answered, our biggest response ever. We used it to source ideas for stories and essential information, even featuring some of you in our coverage.
We built our voter guide to be easily embeddable, and more than a dozen news websites did exactly that. As a result, our guide was seen more than 200,000 times across partner sites. 
We customized our voter guide for Apple News, and afterward, Apple News featured the guide by sending it to all its Californian subscribers through a push notification. 
We made a separate “Did Prop. 50 pass?” website to give anyone searching the internet a fast yes or no on the results.
We built a detailed election results tracker, which broke down voting margins by county for anyone who wanted to dive deep.
We summarized and let you search campaign contributions to both sides of Prop. 50 in real time.
Libraries printed out and shared our one-page version of our guide, which we produced in color and black-and-white, English and Spanish.
We made a Prop. 50-specific email newsletter to keep voters informed throughout the election.
Our team went to community events to share our guide and answer questions, at a music festival and at a UCLA voter education event.
We partnered on a Prop. 50 debate with Capitol Weekly and the UC Student and Policy Center.

And that was all on top of how we continue to improve our existing, trusted ways of informing voters:

We built on our 2024 election social media videos, making Prop. 50 skit videos for TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts in partnership with high school students.
Answering reader questions by email (in English and Spanish), plus in an ever-evolving FAQ.
Producing Props-in-a-Minute video overviews, in horizontal and vertical and also in Spanish.
Walking new voters through how to vote, including registration, checking your status and key dates.
Including thoughtful commentaries on both sides of the issue in our California Voices section.

Here’s more on what made our 2025 Special Election Voter Guide unique.
Our Voter Guide, republished by dozens of other news outlets

We coordinated with local and statewide news organizations all across California to get our trustworthy Voter Guide to as many voters as possible.
Our guide was republished by: CapRadio, KPBS, Jefferson Public Radio, Local News Matters, Lookout Santa Cruz, Yahoo! News via The Desert Sun, San Jose Inside, Long Beach Post, KVCR, KAZU, Mendocino Voice, Stocktonia, Voice of San Diego, Alameda Post, Trinity Journal, San Fernando Valley Sun, Lost Coast Outpost, Times of SD and Yubanet.
CalMatters reporters were called upon to explain Prop. 50 to public radio listeners across the country.  Our reporters shared insights on nationally syndicated shows, including multiple appearances on WBUR’s Here & Now, WAMU’s 1-A, and a segment on  C-SPAN. We were also invited to break down California’s redistricting efforts for listeners in Texas while the state was pursuing its own redistricting campaign. Our team also provided regular support to our partners at the California Newsroom, a collaboration of more than 10 NPR affiliates across California.
To make sure that our partners across the state, who are nonprofit news websites, public media stations, newspapers, TV stations, and more,  we worked to make it easier than ever to republish our work. For the first time, our team built our voter guide differently from the beginning, so that we could share a simple embed code with any partner who wanted to republish it on their site. We also  shared ways to link to our full coverage, download or share our videos, and print simplified one-pagers of our guide. Plus, we offered all the same resources in Spanish.
One of our close partners, Pascale Fusshoeller at YubaNet, reached out when we shared that we’d have a Prop. 50 embeddable guide for the election.
“Our district (CA-03) would change dramatically if voters approve redistricting,” Fusshoeller said. “That’s some exciting news, we’d love to have a fully embeddable guide to Prop. 50.”

Our team, building on innovations from our 2024 Voter Guide, worked to bring our guide to people in their preferred formats and channels. The result? We were there to serve California voters trustworthy information, whether you prefer a suit and tie and going out in public to learn, or if you prefer sweatpants on the sofa scrolling to stay in the loop.

  @calmatters These neighborhoods in San Diego County will see their congressional district maps stretch much farther out if Prop. 50 passes. Hear from a few locals about where they stand. Video and edits: Sarah Al Talqani Edits: Michael Lozano ♬ original sound – CalMatters  

We made a printable, one-page nuts and bolts version of our guide to reach people who frequent libraries and for civic groups to distribute in the real world. Library staff in Alameda County both printed copies for patrons and also made versions on cardstock to put up on display.
We made polished videos for YouTube desktop viewers and then made funny, skit-based videos to reach people doomscrolling on TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. We adapted our guide to work just as well on Apple News. We made a video of the biggest donors, and another on wacky districts – all trying out a call-center type dialogue that would feel out-of-place on calmatters.org but right at home on the preferred social habitats of Gen Z and Millennials.
We even tried a youth social media contest to make Prop. 50 videos as cool as saying 6-7 (ok, not as cool, but still, we tried). Schools used our voter guide as class curriculum to help students pitch us fun ways to cover the proposition on TikTok. We then selected the best three ideas and worked with and mentored the young winners to publish their engaging and nonpartisan clips across our channels.
The winning video entries explained: How Nevada County neighbors are split on Prop 50, how Prop. 50 would alter San Diego district maps and how California has districts, just like the Hunger Games.
We partnered with Capitol Weekly and the UC Student and Policy Center on a Prop. 50 debate, featuring proponents from each of the campaigns and moderated by Rich Ehisen of Capitol Weekly and our politics editor, Juliet Williams.And we brought our guide to community events in Southern California. We went to a music festival in Downtown Los Angeles and a voter information event at UCLA, where we spoke to dozens of students about Prop. 50. Our conversations with students even inspired us to make a TikTok video to answer some of the most common “what’s at stake” questions.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/090325-Redistricting-Modoc-County-MG-CM-32.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)A new report released by the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama (PARCA) suggests changes in federal student reporting may affect the reported number of Hispanic students in Alabama schools, a change which also led to an increase in students who identify as “two or more races.”
“Because of the classification change, it is unclear from the publicly reported data whether Hispanic enrollment rose or fell,” wrote Thomas Spencer, a senior research associate for PARCA and the author of the report. “Alabama State Department of Education [ALSDE] officials said that the number of students who checked the Hispanic box increased by about 1,000 statewide. In past years, Hispanic enrollment had grown more rapidly.”
According to the report, in 2025, Hispanic student enrollment was just over 84,000 students and enrollment for students of two or more races was over 21,900. 
But in 2026, Hispanic student enrollment dropped to 26,458 while enrollment for students that are two or more races increased to 78,610.
Messages seeking comment were left with the ALSDE and School Superintendents of Alabama Monday.
The change in student reporting policy came in a March memo issued by ALSDE made to comply with standards set by the Office of Management and Budget in March 2024. 
The ALSDE notice states “Hispanic will no longer be collected as a separate ethnicity question and will instead be included as a race/ethnicity option” and that the two or more races option will be removed and students who report more than one race will have each one documented separately.
Previously, the question was asked in two separate parts. The first question asked whether the student identifies their ethnicity as Hispanic or non-Hispanic, and the second question asked how the student identified racially. 
The updated form now only asks one question, but allows respondents to check more than one box and adds Middle Eastern and North African as new racial categories.
Hispanic people often differ in how they choose to racially identify themselves.
“Hispanic individuals may consider themselves white. There are Latino Black people, they may consider themselves Native American, if they have indigenous roots, or Spanish or European,” Spencer said in a phone interview Monday.
Spencer said the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown could have contributed to the dip in the number of Hispanic and Latino students, but it’s uncertain due to the new reporting rules.
“We had been kind of tracking the growth and enrollment of Hispanic students over the last couple of decades, frankly, and we kind of wondered about the trajectory this particular fall, considering the new attention that the current administration is paying to immigration and wondered what effect it would have,” he said. “Due to the new classifications, it’s really kind of hard to say, what if any effect that’s had. Obviously, there’s been a significant shift in the identification of students, but to what extent numerically it’s harder to tally.”
Another reason for the dip in Hispanic and Latino student enrollment could be due to how families could be told to fill out the form by the local boards of education.
“You can look at a major swing in the way Albertville reported. They went to more than one race strongly. Russellville is not as much of a heavily Hispanic district, but still, a lot of respondents counted only as Hispanic,” Spencer said.
In October, Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey told members of the State Board of Education that enrollment for the current school year has decreased by 5,800 students. The decrease is the largest drop in 40 years.
Mackey told board members that of the students, roughly 3,000 of them had taken money from the CHOOSE Act and enrolled in a private school. The remaining 2,100 students were unaccounted for.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that allows students to claim up to $7,000 in tax credits for non-public education expenses including private school tuition.
Despite the drop, Spencer said the number of Hispanic people in Alabama will continue to increase regardless of current immigration to the state.
“Any kind of, you know, growth or change in Hispanic populations among students is not necessarily due to migration,” he said.“The Hispanic population grows through natural change, and maybe even at a greater rate than the white population. So regardless of whether or not we have large or small immigration rates, our Hispanic population will continue to grow as they’re American citizens or lawful permanent residents.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Colorado-school.jpg,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

(Photo by Jerry Redfern/Capital & Main)The New Mexico Environment Department on Friday published a “Climate Action Plan” that contains more than three dozen steps to meet Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. 
NMED officials collaborated with their counterparts at the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department to craft the plan, which they describe as a roadmap to a carbon-neutral future for the state. Officials said the plan protects energy industry jobs for New Mexicans while also cutting emissions and tending to the state’s finite natural resources. 
“The New Mexico Climate Action Plan is more than a set of goals — it is an actionable roadmap to a resilient, energy-independent and prosperous future for every New Mexican,” NMED Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. “We are confronting climate change head-on while building a thriving clean energy workforce and creating long-term economic opportunities, especially for communities historically overburdened by pollution.”
The plan and existing policies together put the state on track to nearly cut emissions in half by 2030 when compared to levels from 2005, according to NMED. Officials expect an 82% reduction in emissions by 2050. In a news release, the department said these measures will prevent $294 billion in health care costs, property damage and other pollution-related impacts.
“We’re an energy state — that’s not changing. What’s changing is how we produce that energy,” Erin Taylor, acting cabinet secretary for the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, said in a statement. “This plan shows we can protect the industry jobs New Mexicans depend on while cutting emissions and creating new opportunities in clean energy.”
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grant and the Innovation in State Government Fund, which Lujan Grisham signed into law earlier this year, helped to pay for the plan.
The new plan lists 45 steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including: 

Implementing new rules to mitigate methane leaks from the oil and gas industry and explore the potential of carbon capture technology
Decarbonizing electric grids
Promoting energy-efficient building codes
Enhancing forest health and expand post-fire recovery programs
Creating a statewide organic and food waste diversion program to reduce methane emissions from landfills

An aging generation must reckon with shrinking resources, rising taxes and hard choices about what services Vermont can sustain.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Will Patten: Baby boomers racking up bills Vermont can no longer afford.","This commentary is by Will Patten of Hinesburg. He is a retired business executive and author of the book, “Saving Capitalism, Vermont Shows a Way.”



Growing up, we baby boomers were steeped in the idealism of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King and the minimalist hippie ethic. But Watergate, Vietnam and assassinations would turn idealists into cynical self-serving uber-consumers.  
Our manufacturing economy transitioned to a marketing economy that taught us to always crave more. Supply now drives demand and consumption now drives 70% of the U.S. economy. We have been catered to during the past prosperous decades. The markets have provided us with cheap abundance, so we expect our governments to provide us with protection, education, recreation and transportation. Cheaply.  
Now we live in a more resource-restricted time, and baby boomers are getting old. About 10,000 of us retire every day and live on fixed incomes. We rattle around in our large empty homes and complain about property taxes. But taxes are simply what is due and payable for the services we’ve received, and they won’t go down until we reduce some of the services they pay for.
It will fall to younger generations to perform the cost-benefit analysis underlying our town budgets and identify what we can no longer afford. I wish them luck. There will be challenges:
Much of Vermont’s charm derives from a culture of community, fostered by 251 small town governments for roughly 650,000 people. All but a few towns have their own police and fire departments, schools and road crews. That has to change. The challenge will be to regionalize services while maintaining our culture of community.
And let’s understand that a decision to regionalize services and consolidate school districts to save money is a decision to reduce the quality level of both.
As the climate deteriorates and our population shrinks, we’re going to need more resources to cope with hard times ahead, and that will require new taxes. Two Blue Ribbon Tax Commissions have recommended that we raise new revenues by taxing services and income. That will be a challenge.  
The real estate tax is a wealth tax. It makes sense for baby boomers that have equity in their homes and land. But younger and first-time homeowners are paying an unfair tax on an asset that belongs mainly to a bank. If we have to stick with a wealth tax, it should only be assessed on assets that are easily converted to cash.  
Hard times indeed.

As Michigan grapples with an ongoing teacher shortage, a new report says the state is also falling short when it comes to building a diverse educator workforce.
According to EdTrust-Midwest, just over 11% of Michigan teachers are people of color, even though nearly 40% of the state’s students are non-white.
The study finds about one in 10 Michigan students attends a school with no teachers of color at all, a gap Charlotte Pierce – senior policy analyst at EdTrust-Midwest – said can affect academic outcomes and long-term workforce readiness.
“Strong and diverse teacher workforces have been linked to quantitative improvements in test scores,” said Pierce, “fewer absences and suspensions, higher graduation and college enrollment rates, and an increased trust between students and teachers.”
The report offers a roadmap to strengthen Michigan’s teacher pipeline, such as earlier recruitment and retention efforts. Pierce said state leaders are receptive and open to taking action.
Pierce also pointed out that the lack of diversity isn’t tied to a single failure point, but to barriers that build over time.
“What we really want to frame this as is a pipeline issue,” said Pierce. “So it’s not one single point where we’re losing all of our teachers, but rather, we’re not getting as much diversity of interest in the teaching profession and that could be for a number of reasons, including low pay.”
Researchers say barriers like cost, lack of support during student teaching, and poor early career conditions continue to limit who enters and stays in the profession. Pierce emphasized that representation in the classroom can shape how students see their own futures.
“When students aren’t seeing diversity at the front of their classrooms,” said Pierce, “it’s hard to inspire the next generation, if they can’t see themselves in that profession.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/teach67.png,,,2025-12-23 07:11:40.504931

An analysis from Gov. Mike Braun’s administration estimates that total state tax breaks on businesses and individuals could top $900 million over the next two years if the Legislature were to adopt all the tax changes included in what Republicans dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Republican legislators are poised to take up proposals on conforming the state tax code with federal rules after the legislative session resumes Jan. 5.
The federal changes include temporary deductions for individuals who receive tips and overtime wages along with the interest on loans for vehicles built in the U.S. Other adjustments give numerous tax breaks to businesses, including a broader deduction for some production facilities.
Chad Ranney, Braun’s state budget director, called conformity with the federal tax code “a provision-by-provision decision in conjunction with the Legislature.”
“There’s nothing that says you have to take all or nothing,” Ranney said. “We’ll figure out, working with the Legislature, what makes sense from a policy perspective, what makes sense from a fiscal perspective and, frankly, what gives Hoosiers the best bang for their buck.”
Details from conformity analysis
Indiana’s last major conformity update came in 2023, when Indiana adopted the Internal Revenue Code as of Jan. 1, 2023, bringing the state into line with pandemic-era relief measures such as the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan. 
The state analysis provided to the Indiana Capital Chronicle on Monday projects that taxpayers would save nearly $275 million over the next two years with the deduction for overtime wages. 
The tax break on tips would total about $80 million during that time, while the vehicle loan deduction was estimated at $70 million. 
The biggest of the business tax cuts amounts to an estimated nearly $380 million over the two-year period.










We have more priorities, urgent priorities that we need to tackle first before we implement any of these changes.


– Democratic Sen. Fady Qaddoura


But those savings mean revenue loss for the state budget.
The tax conformity debate will come in the wake of an improved forecast of state tax collections released last week. The new projections show that the state’s cash reserves could grow to nearly $5 billion by the middle of 2027 — more than double what was anticipated when the new state budget took effect in July.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, was noncommittal on what tax code changes legislators will take up.
“Ideally it’d be nice to be revenue neutral on some of that,” Mishler said. “You know, some of them are cost savings and then some would cost money. So I guess we just have to balance that out.”
Legislators would likely need to act quickly to enact those tax breaks for 2025 before individuals and businesses begin filing their tax returns — and amid worries of confusion over differences in what could count toward income subject to federal and state taxes.
It is possible that lawmakers could push through a conformity bill in the first few weeks of the legislative session that is now scheduled to conclude by the end of February.
Arguments over priorities
Few states have so far adopted the federal tax changes despite the Trump administration urging them to do so, The Associated Press reported.
One worry with Indiana adopting all the federal changes is that it would further reduce the state’s tax base, said Neva Butkus, a senior analyst for the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
That could make the state more dependent on its 7% sales tax — among the highest in the country — that now draws in nearly half of the state’s revenue. 
Butkus said the federal tax changes directed a disproportionate share of savings toward the wealthy. She also called the deductions on tip and overtime income “short sighted” and not equitable.
“Why should a child care worker making $30,000 and a bartender making $30,000 all of a sudden pay different amounts in taxes?” she said during a webinar put on by Prosperity Indiana last week. 
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, the top Democrat on the Senate Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee, said he believed the Legislature should be cautious in adopting the federal tax changes.
Qaddoura cited concerns about federal Medicaid funding cuts included in Trump’s tax and spending bill threatening to increase state costs for the health insurance program for low-income families. 
He argued that rather than enacting the federal tax breaks, the state should boost funding for programs such as child care vouchers that have long waiting lists and eliminate the state’s sales tax on residential and business utility bills.
“We have more priorities, urgent priorities that we need to tackle first before we implement any of these changes,” Qaddoura said. “We’re not obligated to comply with the entirety of what has been sent to us.”

Full of sacks containing plastic dust contaminated with lead, cadmium and chromium, the trucks made their way to the outskirts of Berger, Missouri, a town of 250 people along the Missouri River.

The next day brought another 85 tons. Then 43. Then another 22. By early 2014, 6,500 tons — or 13 million pounds — of powder, stuffed into drums and bags, filled the warehouse to its brim.
Over the next five years, drums would spill, sacks would rip and dozens of people would be exposed to the toxic material before it was cleaned up, in part, on the taxpayers’ dime.
 ‘A very successful program’

Raymond Williams had been in the sandblasting business for decades. His Ohio-based company, U.S. Technology Corp., made a national name for itself by leasing sandblasting material and equipment for the restoration of the Statue of Liberty and Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
U.S. Tech also leased the material to federal agencies and defense contractors, such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to strip paint off of planes, ships and other vehicles, including the space shuttle.
The sandblasting material, made of tiny plastic pellets, could be used for several projects before it became too fine to reuse. By that point, it was mixed with paint and metal chips containing lead, cadmium and chromium, heavy metals that rendered the powder hazardous.

Dumped In Berger is a collaboration between KBIA and The Beacon examining the U.S. Technology Superfund site in Berger, Missouri. Stories will publish daily the week of Dec. 15. Read the series.

Normally, hazardous material is considered waste and needs to be disposed of at a licensed facility. But under a federal law known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, companies can recycle hazardous materials into products instead.
They have to meet certain requirements first, though. The new products have to be a usable replacement for the regular version, and they can’t come into direct contact with the ground.
Finally, companies can’t sit on the hazardous material forever. To prevent hoarding, most of it has to be recycled within one to two years.
“If you’re doing these things, you’re exempt from regulation,” Williams told KBIA and The Beacon. “That means you don’t have to have a permit to transport it, you don’t have to have a permit to store it, you don’t have to have a permit to manufacture your product. It’s all exempt from regulation.”
By bypassing these regulations, U.S. Tech and its customers were able to save a lot of money. The cost of getting permits and paying to dump the material at a hazardous waste facility would be “astronomical,” according to Laura Mills, Williams’ lawyer.
At the same time, military officials were under growing pressure from the Department of Defense to comply with federal waste-minimization regulations, according to a ProPublica investigation into military contractors, including U.S. Tech.
Recycling the sandblasting powder helped bases meet quotas for eliminating waste, and recycling the material was baked into Williams’ contracts.
During the 25 years Williams oversaw U.S. Tech’s recycling program, he said the company had written approval from 48 states to offer its services to companies and agencies there.
KBIA and The Beacon reviewed many of these approvals, including one from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, which said: “The MDNR does not consider the spent plastic abrasive to be a solid waste if it is recycled according to (federal requirements).”
“It was a very successful program, and military bases all over the country got awards and prizes for participating,” Williams said.

In a 2007 magazine article, Williams was lauded for his development of a nonporous, stronger concrete block — made with 10% recycled sandblasting powder — that was being used for “re-building the South” after Hurricane Katrina.
“With two production facilities, one just outside of Canton, OH, and one in Yazoo (City), MS, the manufacturing plants are two of the most advanced of their kind in the world,” the article read.
 ‘Doing the right thing’

The Mississippi facility was the outcome of a collaboration between U.S. Tech and a company called Hydromex in 2000. Williams said Hydromex President Dennie Eugene Pridemore approached him with an offer to help recycle his material.
Under this new partnership, Hydromex opened a facility in Yazoo City, a town of 10,000 northwest of Jackson, to recycle U.S. Tech’s sandblasting powder into concrete blocks to help it fulfill its contracts.
It never sold a single block. 
“At some point, they started using less and less cement, less binding agent, to the point that most of their blocks were just crumbling in the yard. They had no structural integrity,” said Richard Harrell, the then-director of the Office of Pollution Control within the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ).
“Then, at some point, (Hydromex) just started pouring it in the ground and pouring pads over top of it,” he added.
A photo provided by Raymond Williams shows flooded trenches where U.S. Technology employees were in the process of digging up buried sandblasting powder during the cleanup of the Hydromex site in Yazoo City, Miss., in 2012. (Cal Tobias/Columbia Missourian)
Hydromex was shut down in 2002, and Pridemore would eventually be sentenced to more than three years in prison.
At the same time, federal investigators looked into U.S. Tech, ultimately concluding that Williams was a victim of Hydromex’s cover-up, not a conspirator.
Meanwhile, Williams took matters into his own hands.
“I went to the attorney general in the state of Mississippi and said, ‘Hey, we had a subcontractor inappropriately bury this material in your state. It’s going to cost millions and millions of dollars to recover it, and as the party that’s contracted with the government to recycle, we’d like to step in and … dig it all up … and put it back in the recycling world,’” Williams said.
Mills, Williams’ lawyer, said her client took on the job “because otherwise, he would not have been able to continue his lease-and-recycle program with the government, because they would have said, ‘Hey, this isn’t working.’”
“It was a matter of stepping up and doing the right thing, but also maintaining the business he had,” she said.
Under the federal law that makes it possible to recycle hazardous material, a company must recycle 75% of its material within a year. If it doesn’t, the material has been “speculatively accumulated,” making it hazardous waste that cannot legally be recycled.
Because Hydromex had speculatively accumulated the material on its site, that material was now hazardous waste in the eyes of the government. But in its offer to help clean up the site, U.S. Tech insisted that it be allowed to recycle the powder, and Mississippi agreed.
In 2003, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Tech entered into an agreed order, a legally binding agreement commonly used by the department. The agreement gave U.S. Tech one year, with the possibility of a second year, to remove, process and recycle the material from the site.
It would take until 2007 — the year after Pridemore was indicted — to fully recycle all of the above-ground powder.
During a later trial, Mills would question Felix Flechas, an expert witness who used to work at EPA Region VIII enforcing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
Flechas said U.S. Tech took a longer time because of the ongoing investigation into Hydromex — which turned the property into a crime scene — as well as wet conditions and the sheer amount of material.
“. . . this project is well within the time frames that would be expected for cleaning up and remediating this amount of waste,” he said.
Despite the delays, Harrell said the department was “trying to work with them” because “the agency encourages recycling.”
Promotional material provided by Raymond Williams shows commercial buildings where U.S. Technology’s “SEALTECH” blocks, made with 10% recycled sandblasting powder, were used. (Cal Tobias/Columbia Missourian)
“(You) had a pretty good collapse in some of the industries at that time, so a lot of the bricks he was making, he was having trouble selling them,” Harrell said. “We just tried to work with him on schedules and timelines as the economy ebbed and waned.”
Williams did sell blocks — in promotional material, he claimed his patented “SEALTECH” blocks, which use 10% recycled material, helped build Walmarts, hardware stores and even a “pregnancy support center” in Ohio, where he’s based.
In 2009, U.S. Tech and MDEQ began investigating the scope of the underground material. Two years later, they amended their original agreed order to give the company another two years to excavate and recycle the buried powder.
In 2013, before the deadline to have everything removed from the site, Williams reached out to MDEQ to tell it that U.S. Tech had gotten approval from the Mississippi Department of Transportation to use its powder in road base for an upcoming highway project.
MDEQ amended the agreed order again, giving U.S. Tech until the end of the year to get all of the remaining material to the MDOT project site.
But in October, the MDOT deal fell through because the department had lost funding for the new highway.
 A different route

Williams immediately reached out to MDEQ to ask if he could instead move the material to a site a mile down the road from the Yazoo City facility, where he hoped to set up his recycling equipment. Mississippi said no.
“We already had one contaminated site. We had contamination in the soil. We had contamination in the water around the site. We were concerned that all we would be doing is moving one problem from Problem A to Problem B and generating another site, ” Harrell testified in a 2015 court case.
“At that point, I don’t think we had any confidence that that material was being handled right,” Harrell told KBIA and The Beacon. “This had been going on for multiple years, and we weren’t seeing near enough progress to remove this material and handle it safely.”
So, Williams turned to the World of Concrete, an industry conference in Las Vegas.
There, he ran into Daryl Duncan, who had worked in abrasive blasting for decades, including as a salesman for U.S. Tech from 2003 to 2005.
“In our discussions, I related that I had to move 16 or 17 million pounds of recycle material out of Mississippi. Daryl said he would love to get the material since he had completed recycling several billion pounds of glass and liked the recycle supply business,” Williams wrote in a statement.
Duncan’s family owned a large warehouse outside of Berger, Missouri, a small town near the Missouri River east of Hermann. The warehouse, once the home of several factories, was vacant.
KBIA and The Beacon were unable to get in contact with Daryl Duncan, but some of his thoughts were included in a transcribed interview with federal investigators.
In that conversation, interviewers questioned whether Williams and Duncan conspired to dump the material in Berger to save Williams from the cost of properly disposing of it, but Duncan insisted he was “trying to develop that (site) into an industrial park.”
“We used to have GenCorps in the building; (it) had 300-400 employees. Was great. They moved out, and we are trying to develop that,” he said.
As part of that new enterprise, Duncan and his then-wife, Penny, founded a new company, Missouri Green Materials, of which Penny was listed as the registered agent. She declined repeated requests for an interview.
From the end of October through December 2013, trucks arrived at the warehouse almost daily, carrying tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds of hazardous powder each trip.
On Nov. 27, 2013, a Google Earth satellite captured at least nine semitrailers in the process of unloading their cargo — used sandblasting powder — into the Berger warehouse. (Source: Google Earth)
The government would later accuse Duncan of knowing it was hazardous. Prosecutors said Williams had it tested in October, and the results revealed more than seven times the legally safe limit of cadmium, a heavy metal and known human carcinogen.
Sacks from Yazoo City and barrels from other U.S. Tech facilities were loaded onto the warehouse floor. When space ran out, they were stacked on top of each other.
According to court documents, Williams tried to inform MDEQ in mid-November that U.S. Tech had been shipping the powder to the Berger facility, but the department never responded. When Williams followed up two weeks later, officials told him to contact Missouri regulators.
“I said, ‘I don’t know why. We don’t have a requirement to do that. But if it makes you happy, we will,’” Williams said.
When Williams called the next day, Missouri officials said Mississippi had informed them that U.S. Tech was illegally hauling hazardous waste into their state.
Both states ordered Williams to stop moving the material as Missouri launched its investigation. Ultimately, regulators at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources deferred to Mississippi’s decision.
“If MDEQ has evidence that this material is/was hazardous waste, then we would consider the material to be hazardous waste, contrary to Mr. Duncan’s claim,” Anthony Pierce, then an environmental specialist at Missouri DNR’s Hazardous Waste Program, wrote to Steve Bailey, an MDEQ employee who oversaw the Hydromex site, in December 2013.
 To be recyclable or not recyclable

In his conversations with Mississippi and Missouri officials, Williams argued that the material was not hazardous waste because it had been granted a recycling exemption under the agreed order.
When Williams volunteered to clean up the Yazoo City site and recycle what was there, Mississippi regulators decided to exempt him from permit requirements. But according to Bailey, the exemption never changed the status of the material itself, which had been speculatively accumulated by Hydromex.
“Since we have deemed it hazardous material, any time it is transported to another facility, it has to be properly manifested as a hazardous waste,” Bailey later testified. “We exempted it (for) them on (the Yazoo City) site.”
Williams also argued that the 2011 amendment to the agreed order allowed him to send the material to a “manufacturing facility designated by U.S. Technology.”
However, when Mississippi approved using the material for the road base, it amended the agreed order. It removed a section allowing U.S. Tech to use the material to make blocks and replaced it with a section allowing it to use the powder for the new highway.
That meant that under the new version of the agreed order, the highway project was the only legal way for Williams to recycle the material.
Because the highway project was made impossible by Mississippi’s state budget decisions, Williams argued U.S. Tech could revert to the previous amendment.
“. . . because the road base opportunity went away beyond our control, we reverted to the prior agreed order and shipped it up here to Missouri Green Materials,” Williams told federal investigators. “They were going to buy the equipment off of us and manufacture concrete products with the material.”
But even if MDEQ had agreed to revert to the previous version of the agreed order, that version said that how much could be sent to a facility “shall be controlled by the production capacity of the facility.” Missouri Green Materials’ capacity was unknown, as it had never recycled this material before and didn’t yet have equipment installed.

When Mills, Williams’ lawyer, pressed Harrell in court about what U.S. Tech was supposed to do after the highway project fell through, Harrell replied, “I believe we always left the alternative that he could ship it to a proper hazardous waste permitted facility.”
Which would be costly. Williams estimated the cost to dispose of 13 million pounds of spent blast media would be around $6 million.
By moving the material without permission, U.S. Tech violated the agreed order, the only thing allowing it to transport the material without permits, Harrell said.
Under federal law, the material had been speculatively accumulated and was therefore hazardous waste. Mississippi’s exemption applied only within its own borders, meaning that in Missouri or elsewhere, the material would be treated as hazardous waste, according to an environmental lawyer and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act expert who spoke with KBIA and The Beacon on background.
It would be several years before federal prosecutors accused Williams and the Duncans of illegally transporting hazardous waste and dumping it in Berger to save Williams from the cost of disposing of it properly.
In the meantime, the trucks had stopped coming. By the time the last truck left the facility, 9 million pounds of powder from Yazoo City and another 4 million pounds from U.S. Tech’s facilities in Arkansas, Georgia, Ohio and Utah filled the Berger warehouse to the brim.
Despite federal and state authorities knowing about the site, the material would continue to sit on the outskirts of the tiny town flanked by the Missouri River for five years.

Growing up in Missouri in the 1980s, the Show Me State meant something.
We built America’s cars. We brewed America’s beer. We even had America’s best baseball teams. Missouri was a bellwether state. If you wanted to know what was happening in the country, Missouri could show you.


But my home state, once proudly independent, is suffering an identity crisis.
There is the capitulation to national political forces — selling out its citizens to curry favor with oligarchs. There is the overturning of the will of voters by officials who owe their careers to those very voters. And there is the systematic hollowing-out of institutions and infrastructure that made us a dynamic force: labor, agriculture, education and rural health care.


The story of the above is a story of power. And if power lies in the ability to impose one’s will, then unilaterally disenfranchising 300,000 Missourians may look powerful indeed.
But in doing so, Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, Attorney General Catherine Hanaway and Gov. Mike Kehoe, don’t build power but enthusiastically cede it. They hand the reins for Missouri’s future to Trump and his malevolent billionaires, even foreign entities, and they are almost certainly shortening their own political careers in the process.


Viewed through a psychotherapeutic lens, Missouri isn’t exhibiting a Nietzschean “will to power.” Instead, I see what Viktor Frankl defined as a will to meaning.
“Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, … or a quest for power, … but a quest for meaning,” the psychiatrist wrote in his best-known work, Man’s Search for Meaning. “This striving to find a meaning in one’s life is the primary motivational force in man.”


So how do these seemingly nihilistic acts demonstrate a desire for meaning? And how does strong-arming voters show weakness?
Consider the beneficiary.
Contrary to conventional American individualism, Frankl writes that true meaning is found in duty to others. His theory of logotherapy “tries to make the patient fully aware of his own responsibleness; therefore, it must leave to him the option for what, to what, or to whom he understands himself to be responsible.” Missouri’s Republican Party has repeatedly shown itself responsible not to its constituents, but to Trump and Trump only.


Anecdote: As a candidate for state legislature, I spent months knocking doors in my suburban Republican district. A native of this district, a fellow churchgoer and parent of four children attending school here, I expected to find common ground with my neighbors “across the aisle”
And I was right: we largely agreed on many topics. Not only did we agree statistically — Amendment 3 restoring abortion rights and Prop A, guaranteeing paid sick leave and raising the minimum wage, both passed convincingly in my district — but we found common ground in face-to-face conversation, from a desire for gun safety to fiscal accountability.


But all too often, our friendly rapport was abruptly squashed by partisanship — partisanship predicated not on honest differences about our community’s needs, but on parroted talking points and hyperbolic proclamations of national political figures.


With each conversation, a depressing picture came into clearer focus. These people weren’t espousing deeply held beliefs or community needs based on lived experience, they were showing solidarity. Solidarity with television talking heads and social media accounts of indeterminate origin. Maddening as this was to me, a neighbor interested in improving our common spaces and shared destiny, I realized they had a different sense of community.


As gruff as our public discourse has become, people are still social animals. We do still travel in packs and sacrifice our own self-interest to boost the interests of others. Frankl’s theory still holds.


Like a trope in a teen drama, leaders like Hanaway and Hoskins show their true colors when they prioritize a pat on the back from the popular kids over the little people who put them there. After all, former Missouri Attorneys General and Secretaries of State have gone on to achieve a sort of MAGA B-list celebrity. That is a type of fame, and fame can pass for meaning, for a time.


But a Missouri in thrall to external validation—whether from a national political party in self-preservation mode or wealthy oligarchs looking to pad their bank accounts—is a Missouri drained of meaning.


Consider Indiana. They became the most consequential state in the nation this month when they voted down a gerrymandered Congressional map. After being showered with promises (and threats) from the RNC, they won a reputation as fearless, independent, and loyal to their constituents. They harken back to a Republican party that honored two things: “maverick” independence and the sovereignty of state’s rights.


Frankl, who built his theory of human motivation after enduring the atrocities of the Holocaust, emphasizes the importance of knowing oneself, of finding meaning not in extrinsic validation but in intrinsic value. Missouri’s inherent value is our citizens. When our officials don’t recognize us as valuable, they have little reason to protect the dignity of our labor or the freedom to make our own healthcare choices. They are happy to trade us away for the fleeting embrace of a celebrity.


Our neighbors — not TV pundits, not billionaires, not a political machine — comprise the community we have a responsibility to honor. “To be human is to be responsible,” Frankl wrote. “Hence, to become conscious of responsibility is to become conscious … of one’s self.”


In 2024, Missourians stood up for the middle class and personal healthcare freedoms. In 2025, we showed the courage—and the numbers—to fight back against unconstitutional gerrymandering. In these acts there is meaning. But if our elected officials don’t recognize the state’s true value (or honor their own oaths of office), then Missouri won’t mean much at all.

When Vermont legalized sports betting in 2023, it established the Problem Gambling Program, which tasked the state Department of Mental Health with expanding resources and support for those with problem gambling issues. 
As part of this effort, the department is rolling out a free 30-hour program to train the state’s mental health clinicians.
“Because this is a new product and offering within the state of Vermont, we wanted to make sure that our mental health clinicians and providers were equipped and educated,” said Chris Allen, the Department of Mental Health’s director of suicide prevention.

The training, which will begin on Jan. 13 and run for 10 weeks in live, virtual sessions, is part of a larger-statewide push to build up the appropriate resources to address problem gambling. State lawmakers allocated $500,000 for the department to use in 2025 for problem gambling programs. The money comes through an agreement with the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery, which receives a portion of the revenue the licensed sports betting operators earn in the state.
In 2024, the Department of Mental Health spent $34,814 out of that fiscal year’s allocated $250,000. Of that, $5,000 went to the training program, as it got off the ground. For fiscal year 2025, the department spent $20,000 on the training program and used nearly the full allocation on the range of its support programs, outreach and staffing for them, a department spokesperson confirmed.
Allen hopes that the training can make more of Vermont’s mental health clinicians eligible to receive referrals on the Vermont Gambling Help website or help them identify and respond to earlier signs of problem gambling in their patients. 
Only 14 providers in the state hold a certificate as a Vermont problem gambling specialist. However, the Department of Mental Health estimates that more than 11,600 Vermonters struggle with problem gambling, citing a national survey from 2021, even before legal online sports betting had begun in Vermont.
He hopes the state will be able to collect better demographic data on how many and which subsets of Vermonters are experiencing sports betting addiction. 
Allen knows that for many people, problem gambling issues compound with other mental health challenges — things like suicidal ideation, substance use disorders and general anxiety around debt.
The training aims to cover these co-occurring challenges, the ethics and fundamentals of gambling issues, as well as strategies to ameliorate the harms of addiction. Allen added that he is particularly glad the training includes a section on techniques for reducing harm, rather than only exploring cold-turkey quitting.
“Abstinence might not be an option for everyone,” he said. “We want to offer this and train clinicians to be proficient in talking through how to moderate a client’s gambling use.” 
Private practitioners and staff at the state’s designated mental health agencies are eligible to participate in the training — the registration for which is now open. Upon completing the free training, clinicians receive 30 continuing education credits, almost meeting the annual requirement to maintain professional licensure as a clinical mental health counselor in Vermont. For some, the expense and time commitment of continuing education courses can be a barrier to full licensure.  
The completion of the 30-hour course is a key component of qualifying for the state’s formal specialist certification.

(Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Corrections)No state that borders South Dakota has publicly confirmed a lethal overdose in a state prison in 2025.
South Dakota has reported eight. 
Most of the suspected or confirmed overdose deaths are thought to be tied to a synthetic drug known as K2, which typically arrives in prisons on sheets of paper soaked with the chemical and dried out for smoking.


South Dakota’s prison overdose problem
This story is part of a series examining a spate of prison overdose deaths in South Dakota, including the causes and potential solutions.
Read the series >


That’s how the drug has appeared in South Dakota’s prisons in each of the three K2 overdoses that have drawn criminal charges so far this year through the office of Attorney General Marty Jackley, who said Friday that another set of charges are pending for a similar case.
South Dakota’s outsized prison death count extends beyond overdoses, and more than half the deaths have been preventable. With 25 total in-custody deaths for the year, the state outpaces every neighbor but Iowa, which has logged 29 deaths for an inmate population more than twice the size of South Dakota’s. 
Death certificates for four of the South Dakota inmates list suicide as the manner of death. Another suspected suicide remains under investigation.
Most of the information released publicly on the overdose deaths has come from Jackley’s office. The state Department of Corrections has offered few details.
The department declined to offer responses to several security related inquiries from South Dakota Searchlight in recent weeks. The agency has also declined requests for an interview with former Iowa prison administrator Nick Lamb, who began his work as corrections secretary for South Dakota in mid-November after the resignation of his predecessor, Kellie Wasko.
Changing formulations, changing dangers
Lamb told the Corrections Commission earlier this month that South Dakota is “no different” from other states in terms of its struggle with K2.
Three correctional officers at Anamosa State Penitentiary in Iowa were reportedly treated for exposure to K2-coated paper a few months ago.
Denny Kaemingk, a former corrections secretary for South Dakota who now serves as a consultant for a security company, said he hears horror stories about K2 from prison officials all over the U.S.
Kaemingk said he’s confident in Lamb, based on the new secretary’s years of service in multiple states.
“He’s a fixer,” said Kaemingk, who was on the team of people who interviewed Lamb for the job of corrections secretary. “He sees problems and sets out to solve them. That’s what we saw that he did in Illinois, Iowa and New Mexico.”

* suspected cause, pending toxicology results



The company for which Kaemingk acts as a consultant, RaySecur, sells a scanner that’s designed to detect the presence of any foreign substances on paper.
In some regions, Kaemingk said, jailers and prison officials put the scanner on a cart and wheel it from cell to cell to check papers in inmates’ possession.
South Dakota has two of the scanning units, Kaemingk said, though the Department of Corrections declined to confirm as much, or to offer any other details on its drug mitigation efforts.
Technologies like scanners need to be able to detect any kind of substance, Kaemingk said, not specific chemicals, because synthetic drugs are frequently reformulated on the molecular level as state legislators vote to add chemicals to their list of banned substances.
The revamps have created a more potent product with more severe side effects. 
“The recipe today might not be the recipe six months from now,” said Kaemingk, who called the difference between the K2 he saw as secretary and what’s now circulating “the difference between night and day.”
DOC changes, concerns about staff
Former Corrections Secretary Wasko told reporters over the summer that friends and family members of inmates had been involved in some of the prison drug trafficking that’s taken place over the past few years.
At a July press conference, in response to a question from South Dakota Searchlight, she said that a March 2024 shutdown of tablet-based inmate communications was tied to drugs.
“We had offenders who were conducting nefarious illicit drug transactions through messaging,” Wasko said, marking the first public explanation for an incident that inspired two bouts of unrest and led to charges for 11 prisoners. 
The Department of Corrections hasn’t allowed in-person visits in Sioux Falls since Father’s Day, in part in response to concerns about visitors passing drugs. 
Four more people died of suspected drug use after the change.
“You can only blame so many things on contact visits,” said Doug Weber, a former South Dakota penitentiary warden.
New corrections leader says SD’s synthetic drug troubles ‘not any different’ from other states

In addition to smuggling in body cavities — something that’s a particular concern in work release facilities — Weber said that people could throw drugs over walls, drop them from drones, try to smuggle things in with the help of volunteers or medical staff, or try to take advantage of daily food service deliveries.
Threats to family members or people’s careers might be used to convince those who come and go from the prison to play along with drug smuggling.
“There’s definitely extortion stuff that goes on,” Weber said.
Weber was critical of former Secretary Wasko’s approach to security, particularly the frequent use of lockdowns, which he said can exacerbate security issues by frustrating inmates if they happen too often or last too long.
During his tenure, he said, there were daily cell sweeps for drugs, and officers worked to identify and target the inmates involved in trafficking.
More than one of 2025’s overdose deaths have allegedly involved collusion between prison staff members and inmates. Jackley first announced indictments for drug trafficking this summer. His office charged a former correctional officer, a 22-year-old named Carson DeYoung, with supplying K2 in September, and announced charges against another inmate and a former prison medical aid named Natalie Krause on Friday.
Jackley said he’s been in conversations with Secretary Lamb about potential security upgrades in the state’s prisons, and that Lamb is “open to working with us.”
He’d also like to see lawmakers stiffen the penalty for collusion between inmates and state employees. This year, lawmakers passed a bill to make it a misdemeanor for supervisors to look the other way when they see unethical or illegal behavior. Jackley wanted felony penalties. 
This year, he said, he’s working with lawmakers on a bill that could attach a possible 50-year prison term to anyone involved with distributing drugs that result in an in-custody overdose.
The details might change, Jackley said, but “this is where the conversation has been going.”
Security measures
The smuggling of K2 on sheets of paper changed the mail policies in South Dakota’s prisons years ago. Instead of being delivered, the letters are scanned and sent to inmates on prison-issued tablets. 
Kaemingk and Weber both said that inmates are always looking for new ways to beat the system. Some will swallow balloons filled with dope, Weber said, and “just wait a few days” to retrieve it from the toilet.
State apologizes, but can’t explain missing evidence in prison overdose case

Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead runs a jail that churns through 18,000 bookings a  year in Sioux Falls. That dynamic — short-term jail stays versus the longer-term sentences served by prison inmates — and the jail’s lack of outdoor areas make it more difficult for drugs to get in, he said, but that doesn’t mean the jail catches everything. 
The jail doesn’t have a scanner for paper, Milstead said, but it does scan inmate mail instead of handing it to inmates. It also has a body scanner, similar to an airport security scanner, used to search anyone who’s booked.
Gov. Larry Rhoden, during a recent press conference, said the state has ordered two such scanners for the penitentiary. Lamb told the state’s Correctional Rehabilitation Task Force that the state is working on security changes at the prison and mentioned scanners, but said he “cannot go into details.”
It’s not unusual to find drugs stashed in a body cavity at booking time, according to Milstead. 
“You’d be surprised at how many people carry it there regularly,” he said.
But the scanners don’t necessarily catch everything, and inmates never stop looking for new opportunities to smuggle in contraband.
“We’ve got people who spend every minute of every day,” Milstead said, “trying to find the most creative ways to get illegal drugs in.”



South Dakota prison deaths compared to other states
Twenty-five state prison inmates have died, including eight by confirmed or suspected drug overdoses, this year in South Dakota. The state has about 3,900 prisoners.
The death numbers stand out in the region:

Twelve inmates have died in Nebraska state prison custody, according to the agency’s news release archive. No release mentions overdose as a cause. Department of Correctional Services spokeswoman Dayne Urbanovsky did not reply to calls or emails about overdoses. Nebraska’s prison population stands at around 5,900.
Fourteen people have died in Minnesota state prison custody this year. None died of an overdose, from K2 or any other drug, spokeswoman Shannon Loehrke said. Minnesota has around 8,000 state prison inmates.
North Dakota, with a prison population of around 2,200, has had no inmate deaths this year, according to corrections spokeswoman Kayli Richards.
Wyoming, with a state inmate population of just over 2,000, has had eight in-custody deaths this year, “none of which were suspicious or narcotic related,” spokeswoman Stephanie Dack said.
There are 3,400 people in prison in Montana. Sixteen inmates have died in 2025, according to the state’s “Mortality in Corrections” online dashboard. The cause of some deaths remains under investigation, but no 2025 death is listed as “accidental,” the category spokeswoman Carolynn Stocker said could include a drug overdose. 
Iowa corrections spokesman Zach Carlyle did not return calls or emails on the subject of deaths in custody. His prison system’s news release archive shows 29 deaths in custody for 2025. None of the news releases mentions causes of death. The majority list hospice, palliative care or an outside health care facility as the location of death. Iowa is home to around 8,500 inmates

Felzkowski spoke at a Republican press conference about postpartum Medicaid expansion in April. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said in a year-end interview with the Wisconsin Examiner that the year has been one of “very steady growth” and top priorities for her in the remaining legislative session include passing legislation to help bring down the cost of health care, advancing medical cannabis legislation and passing additional tax cuts. 
Felzkowski pointed to the state budget in which lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers increased funding for roads and transportation costs, cut taxes including for retirees, increased special education funding and dedicated funding to mental health initiatives. She was one of four Senate Republicans to vote against the state budget, a vote she said she took because of her opposition to increasing the state’s hospital assessment without health care reforms. 
A slimmed down, 18-member Republican majority in the Senate this session and several GOP senators who took a stand against a compromise budget deal gave Senate Democrats an opening to come to the budget negotiating table, and to win compromises on school funding as well as stop cuts to the University of Wisconsin system.
Felzkowski said the slimmer margins this year have been normal. 
“If you look back for the last 30 years, when the Republicans are in control, we are normally at 18-15 margin in the Senate,” Felzkowski said. “When we were up to like 22, that was kind of a gift, so we are a very strong Republican majority right now.”
Felzskowski said working on health care affordability will be her top priority when lawmakers return in January. This includes working on health care price transparency and working to advance her legislation that would make changes to the regulation of pharmacy benefit managers — third-party companies that manage prescription drug benefits between health plans, employers and government programs.
Health care and prescription drugs
Felzkowski’s bill would allow patients to use any licensed pharmacy in the state without facing penalties and require benefit managers to pay pharmacy claims within 30 days. 
“Our neighbors to the south in Illinois just passed their version of PBM reform,” Felzkowski said, adding that her bill has passed out of committee and lawmakers are now discussing whether it will receive a full Senate vote. 
Felzkowski’s health care price transparency legislation would require hospitals to make publicly available to consumers the standard costs of “shoppable services,” which would be defined as those that can be scheduled in advance such as x-rays, MRIs and knee replacements. 
“What is one thing that you buy that you have no idea what it’s going to cost? It’s health care. That’s absolutely ridiculous,” Felzkowski said. “Other states have passed it. They’re starting to see the fruition of it and it does work. There’s a reason we have the fifth highest health care costs. It’s because our Legislature has not done anything to help bring those costs down and it’s time that we actually start doing that.” 
Felzkowski, who has been a longtime advocate for legalizing medical cannabis, said the Senate is “closer than ever” to having a vote on the floor on a proposal to do so, but she believes the chances of the Assembly advancing legislation remain “slim.”
Felzskowski said she hopes legislation to extend Medicaid coverage for postpartum women from 60 days after giving birth to one year isn’t dead this session. Wisconsin is one of two states in the U.S. that haven’t accepted the federal extension.
“I hope that my fellow assemblymen continue to put pressure on their leadership… Deep red states, blue states as well as purple states across the nation have postpartum care for 12 months and they’ve done it because it’s the return on investments for taxpayers as well as being the right thing to do,” Felzskowski said. “We see baby thrive, we see mom thrive, and it actually lowers the cost down the road.”
Fate of WisconsinEye
Felzkowski said Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos are having discussions about solutions to the shutdown of WisconsinEye, the nonprofit service that provides video coverage of legislative hearings, floor sessions and Wisconsin state government business. WisconsinEye halted its livestream and pulled down its video archive last week due to a lack of funding.
“Even if we do something temporary to get us through a session… just get through until April and then do a really deep dive on what should be the next step,” Felzkowski said, adding that that includes looking at how other states cover their state government.
“The transparency is important,” she said, adding they want to ensure people still have access to government proceedings and a record is still being kept of it all.
Felzkowski said she hopes Republicans can get one more tax cut done before the end of the legislative session next year. 
New tax cuts in the works
A few of the ideas legislators are considering include eliminating taxes on tips and overtime. 
“Anytime we can return money to our citizens is a good thing,” Felzkowski said, adding that state Republicans would like to align Wisconsin tax cuts with federal policy. The federal megabill approved in July included a tax deduction on tips and overtime that will be available from 2025 through 2028.
This December, Wisconsin residents are experiencing the highest property tax hikes since 2018, according to a recent Wisconsin Policy Forum report. The report explained that state budget decisions including Evers’ veto that allows school districts an annual $325 per pupil increase for the next 400 years as well as lawmakers’ decision to not provide any increase to state general aid this year have led to the hikes. 
Asked whether lawmakers will look to solutions for lowering property taxes, Felzkowski said it would take a new governor. 
“We have given [Evers] numerous chances to reverse that 400-year veto and he keeps vetoing the bill, so it’s on the governor’s plate right now,” Felzkowski said. “Until we get a different governor in the East Wing and we can start seriously addressing education and all the things that are wrong with it, I don’t know what to say.” 
Felzkowski said that even with the state budget surplus there wasn’t enough state money for the general aid increase.
“There were a lot of mouths to feed on that budget,” Felzkowski said. “With increasing revenues all over, there was not enough money out there to backfill that $325… We would have had to have raised taxes dramatically to do that. The dollars didn’t exist.”
Felzkowski said on education that she hopes Wisconsin will opt into the new federal education tax credit program. The program would provide a dollar-to-dollar tax credit of up to $1,700 to people who donate to a qualifying “scholarship granting program” to support taxpayer-financed private-school vouchers. Evers would need to opt the state into the program by Jan. 1, 2027, but so far has said he won’t. 
Confident GOP will hold Senate in 2026 
Wisconsin Republicans have held control of the state Assembly and Senate since 2010, and next year will test the strength of that majority when the state’s 17 odd-numbered Senate seats will be up for election for the first time under new legislative maps adopted in 2024. 
Last year when the maps were in place for the 16 even-numbered seats, Democrats were able to flip four seats. In 2026, Republicans will need to make sure Democrats cannot flip two additional Senate seats to hold control of the body.
Felzkowski expressed confidence that they will do so. 
“We will come back with a strong Republican majority. We have better policies, we have better ideas and we run great candidates,” Felzkowski said.
There will be several key, competitive districts in 2026 including Senate District 5, which is currently held by Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), Senate District 17, which is currently held by Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Senate District 31, currently represented by incumbent Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) who will face a challenge from Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp). 
“We’re going to run on the same policies we’ve always run on: lower taxes, strong freedoms, strong economies, strong education and government getting out of your way so that you can live the American dream,” Felzkowski said. “The Democrats are going to run on an anti-Donald Trump policy, more government, more influence in your life. It’s all they’ve ever run for.”
Some Democrats have taken election results in 2025 as a sign that people are unhappy with the Trump administration and are ready to elect Democrats. 
Felzkowski said she didn’t think that 2025 election results in other states were going to be applicable in Wisconsin, though she said the new maps could be challenging for Republican candidates. 
“Wisconsin is kind of a unique state. We’re a very purple state,” Felzkowski said. “We knew those candidates in Virginia were going to win, I mean, it’s a blue state so I mean you can’t really base us on what happened in Virginia and New Jersey… We’re going to be running in Democratic-gerrymandered seats, so we’re going to have to work very hard, but we will win.”
Wisconsin also has an open race for governor on the ballot next year. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is considered the frontrunner in the GOP primary, and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, are the current Republican hopefuls.
Felzkowski said she probably won’t endorse in the Republican primary for governor, but she is looking for a candidate who is a “conservative reformer who’s willing to take on the tough issues from health care, education, and corrections, lowering taxes” as well as someone who will do “a deep dive into our agencies,” adding that she hopes they’ll work to root out “waste, fraud and abuse.” 
The Democratic field of candidates is much larger including Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), Milwaukee County Exec. David Crowley, former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, former Department of Administration Secretary Joel Brennan and former state Rep. Brett Hulsey.

(Getty Images)Every generation faces a choice about who we will allow to speak for us, and what kind of political culture we in Ravalli County and across our state intend to build. We cannot control every voice in the public square, but we can draw a moral line between those who contribute to the work of citizenship, and those who seek only to inflame, intimidate, divide, and ultimately purge.
In that spirit, it is time to speak plainly about the extremism of the John Birch Society – their seductive rhetoric, both its history and its present posture.
For more than half a century, the John Birch Society has operated on a simple but destructive premise: That America is infiltrated, corrupted, and on the verge of collapse, not because of human imperfection or political disagreement, but because “the enemy” is always lurking behind the next door, your coworkers, your neighbors – a doctrine of distrust.  This organization built its identity not on civic dialogue but on suspicion. And suspicion, when elevated into doctrine, becomes something far more dangerous.
The record speaks for itself. John Birch Society leaders once claimed that President Dwight Eisenhower, a man who led the Allied forces to victory over tyranny, was a “dedicated communist agent.” They charged that the Civil Rights Movement was a Soviet operation. They declared that fluoridated drinking water was a communist mind-control plot, and that the United States was losing wars by deliberate design. These were not fringe mutterings. They were the public claims of an organization that insisted it alone could see the “truth.”
What we see now is not new; it is simply the next chapter of the same story. When political movements lose the ability to make a better argument or the capacity for humility, when disagreement becomes treason, and when complexity is replaced by conspiracy, the outcome is always the same — the purification mindset. That is a belief that society must be purged of its enemies, real or imagined, in order for virtue to survive.
History has seen this before, and we should be reminded of the cost.
During the French Revolution, Maximilien Robespierre and his Committee of Public Safety believed they could perfect society by identifying and eliminating its “corrupting influences.” They began with real grievances and ended with a guillotine. What started as an appeal to virtue ended in the “Reign of Terror,” not because the people were wicked, but because the logic of purging extremism can lead nowhere else.
The parallels with the Birch Society are not academic. They are structural.
Robespierre and the John Birch Society share the same underlying assumption: That society can be purified by rooting out enemies; that disagreement is a sign of treachery; and that those who do not conform must be exposed and removed.
When any movement defines itself by the enemies it imagines, rather than the values it upholds, it inevitably turns inward. And when it does, it devours its own.
America does not need another era of purifying zeal. We do not need an American Committee of Public Safety dressed up in 20th-century rhetoric. We need the opposite — civic courage, patience, humility, and a willingness to work with people who do not share all of our views. Our Democratic Republic will not maintained by the search for perfect allies, but by the imperfect work of reasoning together, building and rebuilding not tearing down.
The John Birch Society, where the end always justifies the means regardless of the law, represents a failure of that reasoning. It mistakes fear for insight. Intimidation and absolutism for strength. Our nation deserves better than conspiracy in the place of conversation. We deserve better than purging in the place of persuasion. And we deserve leaders who know that the purpose of politics is not to hunt enemies, but to build a future.
In this moment, when our communities are tired of division and hungry for dignity, we must reaffirm that extremism has no place in American renewal. Not because we fear it, but because we understand where it leads. We have seen its outcomes in history, and we have seen its smaller echoes in our own time. The work ahead requires steadiness, not frenzy. Cooperation, not cleansing, not purging our neighbors, but bringing a more persuasive argument to the table.
Let us be a people who choose to build rather than burn down.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/election-image-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 06:57:16.296718

Eight people have died of suspected or confirmed overdose deaths in South Dakota’s prisons in 2025, outpacing neighboring states. Most are believed to be linked to a synthetic drug commonly called K2, which typically comes into correctional settings on pieces of paper that have been soaked with the drug and dried out for smoking.
The prisons have also tallied five deaths listed as suicides this year, and 24 total inmate deaths — higher numbers for the state than any year in recent memory.


South Dakota’s prison overdose problem
This story is part of a series examining a spate of prison overdose deaths in South Dakota, including the causes and potential solutions.
Read the series >


Gov. Larry Rhoden, who recently hired Nick Lamb to succeed former Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko, said he trusts the prison system to turn things around, citing new camera purchases for the Sioux Falls penitentiary campus and the purchase of two new body scanners meant to detect drugs hidden in body cavities.
There’s a backlog on body scanners, but Rhoden said he talked to his predecessor as governor, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, about speeding up their delivery to South Dakota.
“I believe we will still get them yet this winter,” Rhoden said during a press conference on a new women’s prison, now under construction in Rapid City. 
He told reporters that he couldn’t offer much more on the state’s response to the overdoses.
“I can’t talk about any deaths that are currently under pending or active investigation,” Rhoden said. “And I also can’t talk about a lot of the security initiatives or changes we may be making, because that will jeopardize our operations. But we are looking at a lot of changes.”
Rhoden declined a request for an interview to talk in more detail about the issue. Spokeswoman Josie Harms said Rhoden’s comments in Rapid City cover the bases of what the administration can say.
Primary candidates say more should be done
Rhoden’s Republican primary opponents in the 2026 governor race aren’t sure that’s enough. 
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, said in an interview an overdose death count “well above the national average” is a cause for alarm, and that scanning pieces of paper for contamination isn’t enough.
‘Moral leadership’ needed to stop South Dakota prison overdose deaths, inmates and activists say

He’d like to see the prisons patrol more closely to catch drones he says might be dropping drugs into prison yards. He’d also like to see more random searches of cells, better screening of staff members and daily sweeps of the prison yard to make sure drugs haven’t been planted or dropped there before inmates leave their cells each day. 
“You’re never going to have perfection, so the fact that there have been problems is not as much a concern to me as the fact that there is no plan to fix them,” Johnson said. “There doesn’t appear to be any leadership.”
Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden also decried the situation as evidence of a lack of leadership. If elected, he said, he’d move for more collaboration with law enforcement investigators.
“If we can’t even keep drugs out of our prisons, how on earth are we supposed to keep them off the streets and keep our kids safe?” Doeden said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight.
Johnson and Doeden both talked about bolstering chemical dependency treatment as important steps, too.
Jon Hansen of Dell Rapids is speaker of the House in the state Legislature and a Republican candidate for governor. Hansen issued a statement on the overdose situation that read, in part, that “the buck stops with the governor — who can’t seem to get his house in order.”
“This dysfunction affects far more people than just the inmates within,” he wrote. “Repeated prisoner deaths like this opens us up to huge lawsuits, breeds a culture of prison disorder and violence, and makes it harder and harder to recruit and keep good corrections officers.”
Independent candidate weighs in
Allison Renville of Sioux Falls, who’s running for governor as an independent, volunteers at the penitentiary, working with a group of Native American inmates.
Renville said the Rhoden administration “needs to find out who is causing these casualties, either inmate or staff, before more lives are lost.”
But Renville sees other problems that need solving if the prison system expects to draw inmates out of cycles of drug use.
“Working to address the substance abuse and its underlying problems like depression, suicidal ideation and poverty will help people prone to predatory practices like K2 distribution,” Renville said.
Renville cited a shortage of space in chemical dependency treatment, a lack of options for activities and inmate lockdowns as factors contributing to drug use.

(Getty Images)About two dozen Idahoans gathered amid cold winds Thursday night in Nampa, holding artificial candles to mourn at a “pre-funeral” for affordable health care in the U.S. 
The gathering, organized by a group called the Appleseed Project, occurred the same week that Idaho’s health care insurance marketplace ended open enrollment, with thousands canceling their plans with the expected expiration of federal health care premium subsidies.

“Affordable health care is not yet dead, but it is on life support,” Alice Nelson, one of the event organizers, said Thursday. 
The “Health Care Vigil” included various stories from locals about the importance of affordable health insurance and ended with a call to action to contact Idaho’s congressional delegation and urge their support to extend the federal expanded health care premium tax credits, which are set to expire Dec. 31. 
The federal tax credits had reduced Idahoans’ premiums for insurance bought through the state marketplace, created through the Affordable Care Act, by an average of $407 each month, according to the health policy research organization KFF. 
U.S. House Republicans, including Idaho Reps. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher, voted last week on a health care bill that did not include an extension of the tax credits. Four centrist House Republicans joined Democrats in a petition to force a separate vote on extending the credits for three years, but a vote won’t occur until the new year, States Newsroom reported. 
Thursday’s gathering in Nampa focused on the tax credits.

“Tonight, we may be in mourning, but that doesn’t mean we are giving up,” Nelson said. “We will hold Congress’s feet to the fire until they have extended those tax credits.”

She previously worked for a company that kept her hours to part time, meaning she wasn’t eligible for health insurance coverage through her employer. She said she was offered COBRA, through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which allows for temporary health coverage if there’s a change in eligibility. 
At the time, a plan through COBRA would cost her $550 a month, she said. Franco was working around 28 hours a week for minimum wage, $7.25 an hour, which meant the premium cost would cost more than half of her paycheck, she said.
She experienced kidney failure and required dialysis for more than four years before she received a kidney transplant this February. She advocated for maintaining health coverage for everyone. 
Gary Sandusky, an organizer of the event, urged those in attendance to reach out to U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate deadlocked on two proposals to address rising health care costs, including a bill co-sponsored by Crapo and Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy that would have provided money through Health Savings Accounts for some state marketplace enrollees in 2026 and 2027, States Newsroom reported. 
Crapo and Cassidy’s proposal failed to reach the needed 60 votes to advance in the U.S. Senate. Crapo and fellow Idaho U.S. Sen. Jim Risch voted against a Democratic-led bill that would extend the premium tax credits for three years. 
If the U.S. House approves the bill to extend the tax credits, it will go to the Senate. It’s likely Crapo and Risch will again contend with the three-year extension proposal. 
“So what we’re suggesting is that, Senator Crapo, who was instrumental in defeating the ACA tax credits in the Senate, he will have to deal with it again,” Sandusky said Thursday, “and we think he needs to hear from Idahoans.”

(Photo courtesy of Luisa Caddle)When campaign consultant Sean Caddle pleaded guilty in 2022 to murder-for-hire, he was allowed to remain at home for nearly two years while he cooperated with federal prosecutors on a political corruption investigation. 
But that probe went nowhere, and now a series of prison interviews with Caddle raises questions about why the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Newark wasn’t able to bring charges stemming from a sweeping pay-to-play scheme that Caddle ran. 
“This was all a sham,” Caddle said. “I was never questioned [about] what I was doing wrong with those groups.”
Caddle, 47, is serving a 24-year sentence at the federal correctional institution at Fort Dix in Burlington County for paying two hitmen to murder Michael Galdieri in his Jersey City apartment in 2014. Galdieri was a friend of Caddle’s and, as the son of a former state senator, hung around and worked on campaigns. 
Caddle signed a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors in 2021 that required him to plead guilty to the murder-for-hire plot and provide information about political corruption. “He has been working, collaborating with the FBI in developing an important investigation,” defense attorney Edwin Jacobs told the court when Caddle pleaded guilty and was allowed to return home. 
Twenty months later, prosecutors noted his cooperation and recommended a lighter sentence.
But little came of the investigation, and Caddle received a longer sentence than was recommended by the prosecutors. Lee Cortes, an assistant U.S. attorney at the time, told the court he was satisfied with Caddle’s cooperation, but the information was “not actionable.” Cortes asked for a sentence of 15 years, but the judge tacked on another nine. 
Caddle insists he had evidence of political corruption, but he was never asked about it.
“I said, ‘Look, I’ll peel back all the layers of the dark money funds that existed,’” Caddle said he told federal prosecutors. “While initially stating they had tremendous interest, the reality was they didn’t even peel a page back on it.”
The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Newark declined to comment.
Caddle worked on political campaigns for about 20 years. He was primarily a get-out-the-vote specialist and also ran a series of funds that raised money for those campaigns. Early in his career, he worked for former Sen. Bob Menendez. He also worked closely with former state Senator Ray Lesniak, a Democrat from Union County who rose to a leadership role and ran for governor in 2017. Caddle also worked on campaigns to elect members of the Elizabeth Board of Education and on municipal elections in Perth Amboy, Bayonne, and Little Ferry. 
Caddle said he used dark-money funds for about a decade to skirt New Jersey’s pay-to-play laws, which restrict government contractors from making campaign donations. Dark money refers to nonprofit advocacy groups that are allowed to spend 49% of their budget on election campaigns and are not required to disclose their donors. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that this kind of campaign funding is constitutional. 
Caddle said he offered federal prosecutors information that would expose the secret donors, the elected officials who took the money, and the favors the officials did for those donors. But after his initial proffer — the statement cooperating witnesses provide about what they have to offer — neither the FBI nor the federal prosecutors followed up, he said. 
A recorded conversation obtained by the New Jersey Monitor documents a phone call between Caddle and his attorneys in the days before his sentencing. In that conversation, the attorney, Edwin Jacobs, tells Caddle that the U.S. Attorney’s Office is telling the judge that his cooperation was “stellar” and Caddle responds that he wishes he could tell the judge that. 
“But the problem is, after we did that initial proffer that you were at, they never questioned me about any of the other people,” Caddle says on a call he recorded with his attorneys. “I wish I could tell you they asked me about 37 people. They didn’t even ask me about the other four people on the proffer.”
In the conversation with his attorneys, Caddle says the only person investigators asked him about was Antonio Teixeira, the former chief of staff to state Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union).
Teixeira, 46, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and tax evasion and was sentenced to eight months of house arrest and three years’ probation in 2023, a month after Caddle was sentenced. Teixeira admitted that he had stolen approximately $100,000 from various campaign funds run by Caddle. 
Caddle said he is haunted by a phone conversation he had with Teixeira when the investigation was first closing in on him. Caddle said he told Teixeira that he was worried about becoming a cooperating witness, because a lot of his allies and colleagues were going to be hurt. Teixeira told Caddle he should do what’s best for his family, Caddle said. 
“My exact next words were, ‘If I do that, a lot of people will go to jail,’” Caddle said. “His exact words, without skipping a beat, was, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be all right.’”
Caddle now looks back at that conversation and believes Teixeira had the protection of powerful people.
“What do you mean you’re going to be all right? How are you going to be all right?” Caddle said. 
Teixeira didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
It’s impossible to know why the investigation never went any further. If there were a grand jury convened, that information would never be made public.
Peter Katz is a federal criminal defense lawyer in New Jersey who was a prosecutor for many years, worked on political corruption cases in New York, and then worked in Trenton for the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Katz said it’s not unusual to see no charges come from information provided by a cooperating witness. 
“The difficult part is when you have a piece of information, you have no idea how that fits into a larger picture,” Katz said.
He did not have any information about the Caddle case and spoke with the New Jersey Monitor to provide context. It’s impossible to know why prosecutors don’t bring a case because they are ethically bound to keep information secret if no charges are filed. 
“Usually it’s for a non-nefarious reason. It may be a manpower issue. It may be it doesn’t rise to the level of their interests. It may not align with what the U.S. attorney wants to focus on at the time. It may be there’s not enough evidence,” Katz said. “And it may be because of either incompetence or laziness or political persuasions. Certainly all those are possible. And I’ve certainly have unfortunately seen prosecutors do things that are unethical and inappropriate.”
Caddle looks back at the 20 months he was on home arrest, waiting for investigators to interview him. He thinks he was a patsy. 
“When it turned into a nothing burger, you know, you’re shaking your head going, ‘What happened here?’” Caddle said. 
The expectation among many was that Caddle’s cooperation would result in a major corruption case because he was allowed to remain at home for so long. 
“I remember so many different articles about, oh, how this is going to be the moment. And I’m reading these articles at home and I’m thinking to myself, Well boy, I don’t know what the hell they’re talking about. Like, I’m here. I’m not talking to anyone,” Caddle said. “And then you get frustrated, you develop anger, you get to feel like you got played.”

The state-backed grant will support BWXT's proposed TRISO fuel manufacturing facility in Gillette. 
The post Gordon awards $100M to northern Wyoming nuclear fuel manufacturer appeared first on WyoFile .","Gov. Mark Gordon on Friday awarded a $100 million state grant to BWXT to support its proposed $500 million nuclear fuel manufacturing facility in Gillette.
The Lynchburg, Virginia-based company, a longtime U.S. Navy contractor, says construction of its “Category II” TRISO fuel plant could begin next year, pending approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It’s expected to go online in 2030. 
TRISO consists of tiny enriched uranium pellets the size of poppyseeds, each encased in “carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of radioactive fission products,” according to the Department of Energy. TRISO can withstand higher temperatures than traditional nuclear fuels, and the fuel never leaves the encased pellet, the agency says.
BWXT is the first and sole recipient of Wyoming’s Large Project Energy Matching Fund program, created in 2024. The fund, as well as the Energy Matching Funds grant program, are administered by the Wyoming Energy Authority, while the governor has sole discretion over final grant awards.

“This is about meeting real energy demand with real projects,” Gordon said in a prepared statement. “Energy Matching Funds are not about government picking winners; they are about responding to market signals and investing where private capital, innovation, and demand are already moving.”
BWXT’s project aligns with President Donald Trump’s “energy independence agenda,” Gordon said, by advancing U.S. nuclear energy amidst a desire for the industry to be less reliant on foreign nations for nuclear materials. It will also create an estimated 200 permanent jobs and will “contribute approximately $100 million in Gross State Product annually,” according to an Energy Authority analysis.
But the state grant programs, including the $100 million award to BWXT, have faced criticism. 
There’s significant opposition to BWXT’s nuclear fuel manufacturing project in coal country, explained Gillette City Councilman Jack Clary. Aside from the human health and environmental concerns, the state is essentially using its fossil fuel largess to support a private company that threatens to compete against Wyoming’s legacy energy industries, he said.
“Down the road, coal will take a big hit because of this,” Clary told WyoFile. “We’re taking that money that was generated by coal and oil and [natural] gas to help fund a private business. It’s just not what we feel the money should be used for. Why are we allowing [a Virginia company] to actually extract money out of state? It’s insane.”

Although the grant programs include a matching requirement, the concept of giving state money to private energy businesses has also come under fire in recent legislative sessions. 
Gordon, however, maintains it’s necessary for Wyoming to provide financial backing for new energy projects in a highly competitive arena. “A former Legislature made a smart, forward-looking, say-yes-to-Wyoming decision,” Gordon said, referring to the creation of the grant programs. “States across the country are competing for these projects every day. Wyoming is in that competition, and it’s one we intend to win.”
Nuclear divisions
BWXT’s nuclear fuel manufacturing plant represents Wyoming’s third major foray into “advanced” U.S. nuclear energy. 
Portions of TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear power plant are already under construction near Kemmerer. The $4 billion project is backed by a $2 billion commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Meanwhile, Radiant Industries’ proposal to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing plant in Natrona County divided both residents and elected officials, in part, because it would have required storing spent nuclear fuel at the facility. Political division swelled when Radiant announced in October that it was withdrawing its plans in Wyoming and taking the project to Tennessee.
Though BWXT’s project does not include storing spent nuclear fuel waste, its reception among public officials in Campbell County and Gillette has been mixed. In a 6-1 vote, the Gillette City Council agreed to submit a letter of support for the $100 million grant to BWXT, the Gillette News Record reported, while the board of county commissioners declined to do the same. Two commissioners submitted a letter of support independent of the body, according to the News Record.
Clary, the lone dissenting vote on the city council, said he worries that a perennial effort to roll back Wyoming’s ban on storing spent nuclear fuel waste from out of state will eventually come to fruition and force radioactive waste on Wyoming communities that don’t want it.
“All you need is some money, a couple lawyers and policies do change,” Clary said.
Gillette Mayor Shay Lundvall indicated the community can help advance nuclear energy without sacrificing its efforts to preserve the coal, oil and gas industries.
“Gillette has always powered this nation, and now we are expanding that legacy,” Lundvall said in a prepared statement. “Governor Gordon’s decision to award BWXT significant matching funds is a clear vote of confidence in our people, our community and our role in America’s energy and technology future.”

The government is illegally allowing a Trump donor’s drilling company to skirt a court ruling that halted development at a Delaware-sized oilfield, conservationists claim.
The post Drillers say ‘political process’ outweighs environmental law in Wyoming oilfield appeared first on WyoFile .","“The political process,” and not environmental law, governs the development of a Delaware-sized oil and gas field in central Wyoming, drilling companies argue in an ongoing lawsuit that challenges the Converse County Oil and Gas Project.
A drilling magnate whose acolytes now oversee federal agencies in charge of oil and gas permitting made that argument — and others — through his company’s Dec. 8 court filing.
Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, donor to President Donald Trump and friend and associate of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, is watching his company’s prospects flourish as Converse County drilling proceeds despite a temporary injunction imposed by a Washington, D.C. court.
Continental, along with Devon Energy, Anschutz Exploration and the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, is fighting a new claim by the Powder River Basin Resource Council and Western Watersheds Project in the 3-year-old suit. The energy companies are aligned with the state of Wyoming and the federal government — all opposing a new claim that developers are skirting a court’s 2024 temporary injunction.
Federal Judge Tanya Chutkan last year halted drilling across 1.5 million acres until environmental questions raised in the original lawsuit are resolved. The conservation groups want to supplement their 2022 suit after the Bureau of Land Management this summer issued 255 permits to drill in the area and development apparently began, their filings state.
“Just because [conservationists] wish BLM had decided differently does not mean that they can enlist this Court under the guise of judicial review to delay or block the Project.” Continental Resources
But some environmental laws don’t apply to the development, despite conservationists’ claims, Continental and its allies say. In a court brief, the drilling companies said the Bureau of Land Management has analyzed the environmental damage drilling will cause and greenlighted the project.
“BLM analyzed the relevant impacts and feasible alternatives in its 1,108-page [Final Environmental Impact Statement],” the brief states. The agency in the last year also wrote shorter environmental reviews to authorize the 255 permits.
“Just because [conservationists] wish BLM had decided differently does not mean that they can enlist this Court under the guise of judicial review to delay or block the Project,” Continental and the other drillers wrote. “The political process, and not [the National Environmental Policy Act], provides the appropriate forum in which to air policy disagreements.”
The political process
Hamm’s “political process” includes donating millions of dollars to Trump’s campaigns, causes and aligned political action committees. Critics say the donations, documented by numerous media outlets, gave Hamm influence over energy policy and the political appointees who implement it.
In addition to Burgum atop the Department of the Interior, Trump appointed Hamm’s associate Chris Wright as Secretary of Energy. Last year, the University of Wyoming hosted Hamm at a fireside chat, honoring him as a “titan of industry” for advancements in fracking and horizontal drilling.
Gov. Mark Gordon joined Hamm, the executive chairman of Continental, at a Houston industry conference earlier this year and hailed both the Oklahoma oilman and Trump. “The new administration — with energy friends Doug Burgum and Chris Wright — understands states know how to manage their resources best,” Gordon said, according to one report.

The BLM issued the permits under agency “resource management plans” instead of relying on the overarching Environmental Impact Statement for the entire 5,000-well drilling proposal. That impact statement prompted the conservation lawsuit in 2022 and the temporary injunction. Judge Chutkan based her stop-work finding on a federal misrepresentation of groundwater impacts.
The BLM re-wrote that section of the statement and this summer began issuing drilling permits. Those permits, however, cited the resource plans, not the Environmental Impact Statement, as the authority under which drilling could begin.
Conservationists called foul and are asking to update their suit with new claims. That’s where the issue sits today, with conservationists and industry advocates at loggerheads over whether the suit can be updated and supplemented.
Pollution, odors, hazards
The latest round of court filings is long on legal arguments rather than the effects of drilling itself. The conservation groups don’t have a stake in the development — they lack “standing” — drilling advocates say. Powder River and Western Watersheds shouldn’t be allowed to bring new claims in a case that is close to resolution, drillers contend.
Developers also question the chance of conservationists’ success and whether claims of potential environmental destruction have already been legally resolved. Drillers said allowing the new claims would “scuttle any hope of timely final resolution” of the suit.
The new conservation claim “seeks to unnecessarily complicate this simple process, delay resolution of pending matters, and yoke separate and distinct agency decisions to unrelated matters before the Court,” the Department of Justice stated. “[T]his Court should deny the Groups’ motion to file a supplemental complaint,” Wyoming said.
The BLM’s permits were issued “in circumvention of the interim injunction,” the conservationists claim. The new claims are closely related to the original suit, and rules require judges to freely grant new pleadings, the conservation groups say.
To establish standing, the supplemental requests say that Maria Katherman and others are affected by the industrialization of the area. Members of the group who visit the wide-open landscape will suffer “exposure to air pollution, industrial noise, noxious odors, and traffic hazards; reduced wildlife viewing opportunities; deteriorated viewsheds and scenic enjoyment, including stargazing; and other harms.”
During one visit, “Katherman counted 42 semi trucks in just a 5-mile stretch, all hauling gravel or fracking sand,” conservationists state. The conservation groups say development could extirpate 54 sage grouse breeding ground leks and threaten more than 1,000 raptor nests.
Conservationists fought the firing of a BLM employee who they say was unjustly terminated by Trump’s first administration after standing up for wildlife protections.
Chutkan had not scheduled further action after Powder River and Western Watersheds filed their last brief Friday.
Continental claims an environmental ethos. Wildlife preservation is “a fundamental aspect of our operations,” the company states. Hamm is a philanthropist, donating millions to diabetes research and education, the University of Wyoming said.

The Forest Service resumes the long-delayed process to manage climbing in the popular canyon. Now it’s seeking public feedback.  
The post Feds propose ending ban on climbing route development in Tensleep Canyon — again appeared first on WyoFile .","The much-delayed federal plan to manage rock climbing on the soaring cliffs of Tensleep Canyon has resumed, laying the groundwork for climbers to renew route development after a nearly six-year ban. 
The U.S. Forest Service released a draft environmental assessment last week, and is seeking public comment through Jan. 20. The plan’s proposed actions include opening the canyon back up to conditional rock-climbing route development — which groups like Bighorn Climbing Coalition have long urged. That would put an end to a ban that’s been in place since 2019 in the recreation destination.
This is the third iteration of a plan that users have awaited for years. This one is accompanied by an extensive inventory of climbing routes. It lists the locations as well as pertinent conditions such as trail erosion or cliffs where the rock has been chipped away or glued — a controversial practice known as “manufacturing.” 
Sport climbing is characterized by the use of metal anchors permanently bolted into the cliff face. Climbers attach carabiners and ropes to them as they ascend. The prevailing ethos among climbers is that humans should not interfere with the natural rock resource by manipulating the route to improve the climbing experience. 
But without guardrails on climbing development, route building on Bighorn National Forest — and other public land — has historically occurred with little oversight, a reality that has spurred conflicts. The Tensleep Canyon plan could change that by setting development ground rules for the canyon. 
The draft details steps to significantly update an area that’s been hit by impacts of heavy use including rogue trails, crammed parking lots, improper disposal of human and pet waste, erosion at the bases of cliffs and a proliferation of dispersed camping. Proposed changes include adding up to 16 miles of mostly existing trails to the National Forest Service’s network, re-naturalizing 2.2 miles of closed or rerouted trails, prohibiting dispersed camping in certain areas, installing vault toilets in four locations and designing a parking area to accommodate up to 50 parking spaces.

Under the proposed action plan, the Forest Service would close the Leigh Creek Research Natural Area entirely to sport climbing and remove all 25 existing routes there. Sensitive plant and animal species have been identified in that zone.
The plan also proposes improving staging areas — spots at the base of routes where climbers spend time while roping up and belaying — with materials like retaining walls and staircases. That proposal aims to minimize erosion and other impacts. 
Starts and stops 
It wasn’t long ago that Tensleep Canyon was an off-the-beaten-path climbing area. Word got out, and in an era of social media and growing interest in the sport, the former backwater half an hour east of Worland has become one of the most popular sport-climbing destinations in the Northern Rocky Mountains, according to the U.S. Forest Service.
The federal land-management agency anticipated the sport’s rise. A 2005 resource management plan predicted climbing in Tensleep Canyon would require formalized management and included recommendations to develop a management plan.
It wasn’t until a climbing conflict roiled the canyon in 2019, however, that the agency diverted energy and resources toward that plan in a meaningful way.
Climbers had discovered what they believed was widespread, manufactured climbing routes. This process of either gluing holds to the rock or chipping them out using drills or hammers can be used to turn a featureless rock wall into a climbable route. While some degree of TLC is often employed to blow out loose stones or clean up routes during development, most climbers agree that significantly altering the character of the rock is unacceptable.

A battle grew over ethical development, who the culprits were and how to make them stop. That boiled over in a nighttime raid by climbers who manually chopped bolts from rock faces and affixed padlocks to bolts.
Following these heated actions, the Forest Service in July 2019 halted the establishment of any new climbing routes or trails in the entire Bighorn National Forest. It then began work on the plan, which stands to be one of only a handful of Forest Service plans specifically focused on climbing. The Forest Service has no national-level guidance on climbing. 
The district initiated a scoping process in 2021, but the process was put on ice after then-District Ranger Traci Weaver and other key players left their positions. Inventories started in 2022, and the Forest Service resumed the project in 2023. But it was paused again last year due to further turnover and a desire for more time to consult with Native American tribes. 
All told, forest officials met with historic preservation and other representatives from the Northern Arapaho, Eastern Shoshone, Crow, Northern Cheyenne, Sioux and other tribes on the matter, according to the Bighorn National Forest. 
What now?
The agency’s Powder River District office released the new 27-page Environmental Assessment last week. The public can view it, along with the inventory, implementation guidance and other documents, at this online project page or learn more through a StoryMap. Comments are due Jan. 20. 
The project area encompasses 26,544 acres located in the southern Bighorn range between the towns of Ten Sleep and Buffalo. Though area recreators also include OHV riders, hunters and skiers, the plan hones in on climbing.

“Bighorn National Forest staff need a climbing management plan to effectively manage rock climbing … to minimize user conflict, and to protect the area’s resources,” the office stated in a press release. 
The proposed actions are all designed to that end, it states. A major part of that is enacting a review and approval process for new rock climbing route development. 
The proposed plan would allow route development under certain conditions. It could occur “only where rock climbing would not negatively impact wildlife and botany sensitive species,” for example. It couldn’t negatively impact traditional cultural use areas either. 
In addition, the guidelines would “prohibit route development that removes rock from areas except where the rock in its natural position poses a risk to the climbing party or a future climbing party,” and “would prohibit gluing, attaching artificial holds, or using mechanical equipment to create holds where a natural hold did not exist.”

From Miss Frontier to the U.S. Senate, columnist Kerry Drake writes, Lummis has had remarkable success in state and federal offices. 
The post Lummis not running again changes 2026 political strategies appeared first on WyoFile .","If I had known I’d be interviewing a future U.S. senator, I would have probably worn something a bit more formal for the occasion on that hot July afternoon in 1976.

Opinion

Then again, I couldn’t. Cowboy hat, boots, Western shirt and jeans were the required uniform for anyone who wanted a press pass to Cheyenne Frontier Days. I looked like a drugstore cowboy but didn’t mind. The beer in the press box was cold and free, which is how I, and all the others covering the biggest rodeo in the country, liked it.
Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a former Miss Frontier, dropped a bombshell last Friday that she’s not running for re-election to one of the nation’s safest Senate seats. My mind turned to our first professional encounter nearly a half-century ago. I had only been a reporter for the Wyoming State Tribune for three months.
Lummis was already on the roof above the stands, watching bulls and riders coming out of the chutes. Wearing a white buckskin outfit and braided pigtails, she definitely looked like rodeo royalty. 
Our conversation didn’t include a drop of politics, by my recollection.
We talked about her cowgirl life growing up on a large Laramie County ranch. Her father, Doran Lummis, was chairman of the Laramie County Republican Party and a county commissioner in the 1960s. While she was obviously proud of her dad, I don’t recall her expressing any aspiration to follow in his footsteps into public service. 
She did, though, beginning in 1979. Lummis, then 24, is still the youngest female legislator ever elected to the Wyoming House. In 2020, she became the first woman U.S. senator to represent the Equality State.
I don’t know if serving as Miss Frontier played much of a role in her early success, but publicity certainly didn’t hurt. Once she was in the Legislature, Lummis’ political career took off.

Lummis received her law degree at the University of Wyoming in 1985, spent 14 years in the Legislature, clerked for the Wyoming Supreme Court, was elected state treasurer in 1998 and served two terms.
Then she was elected to the U.S. House and re-elected twice before taking a break from politics in 2016. But four years later, when Wyoming’s U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi retired, she was back campaigning for his open seat. Lummis raised $3 million for the GOP primary and general elections, an impressive sum for Wyoming politics, and defeated her Democratic opponent by 46%.
One of the reasons Lummis decided to leave after her term expires is that she’s tired.
“Deciding not to run for re-election does represent a change of heart for me, but in the difficult, exhausting session weeks this fall, I’ve come to accept that I do not have six more years in me,” the 71-year-old senator said in a news release. 
I can relate. I haven’t had the stress of campaigning; I’ve just covered them. While Lummis kept climbing the ladder, my career literally flatlined. I’ve done the same thing for 49 years: talk to interesting people and write it up.
But I did hang up my cowboy reporter costume in the early 1980s, and after various stints as a photographer, sportswriter, legislative reporter, film critic, entertainment editor and managing editor, I decided my true passion was reporting and commenting on Wyoming politics. 
Lummis and I live in two vastly different political worlds. Trump is one of her heroes, and I can’t wait until he’s out of office. Things were much simpler when we were younger and could enjoy watching the rodeo while she told me what life was like on her family’s ranch.
Lummis’ decision leaves many Republican candidates scurrying to see if there’s a place for them on the 2026 ballot. That only happens when a veteran politician unexpectedly retires and injects some life into what seemed like a pretty dull campaign season, except for electing a new governor to replace term-limited Gov. Mark Gordon.
For political columnists like me, this is an early Christmas present I didn’t dream of happening.
With the holiday just two days away, I’d like to say please, please, please! to Santa: Give us a U.S. House race between Gordon and Secretary of State Chuck Gray, two men who really don’t like each other.
You might be wondering why I’m talking about the House, when Lummis is in the Senate. I’m guessing Hageman will run for the upper chamber, leaving the lower chamber for the taking.  
Gordon has no state office to return to, so relocating to Washington, D.C., would be the perfect next step. He’s always had a high approval rating as a moderate governor, and he’s vetoed some of the far-right Freedom Caucus’ worst ideas.
Gray desperately wants to run for another office, as evidenced by the “Elect Gray” advertisements that ran during the Chicago Bears game Saturday. The spots didn’t say for what office, just elect him!
One thing is certain: Gray has no appetite for taking on U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, the early favorite to replace Lummis.
We’ll have to see how well the Hageman juggernaut, which began when she trounced Liz Cheney in 2022, holds up, and who will challenge her. Hageman will likely win, but Cheney’s downfall proved that no Wyoming pol is invincible.
The governor’s race could be a lightning rod for every House Freedom Caucus lawmaker and Senate ally. Non-officeholders already campaigning are Brent Bien and Joseph Kibler. Reportedly showing interest are Rep. Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, and Senate President Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester.
The more ultra-conservatives who dilute the gubernatorial candidate pool, the easier it will be for moderate Sen. Eric Barlow, R-Gillette, to win. 
The Freedom Caucus has the opportunity to see if it can retain power and grow an agenda aligned with Lummis that she no longer feels the need to lead. Lummis and I are hoping for different outcomes, but after 50 years of this, maybe we can both sit back and enjoy the show.

(Courtesy of the Idaho Supreme Court)The Idaho Supreme Court has dismissed a lawsuit from a bidder for an Idaho Medicaid contract to run mental health services.
The Dec. 18 decision upheld a lower state court’s decision to dismiss the lawsuit by Beacon, resolving a years-long legal dispute over a managed care contract that is likely Idaho state government’s largest contract, valued at $1.2 billion over four years.

Before Idaho awarded the company Magellan the contract to run Medicaid mental health services in 2023, Beacon initially had the highest score for its bid — but the state disqualified the company due to past work that officials said was related to the contract. 
Later in 2023, two separate Idaho district court judges dismissed lawsuits by Beacon and Optum, another bidding company that didn’t win the contract. The judges agreed that they lacked jurisdiction to review the state’s contract award decision, citing limits on judicial review in the State Procurement Act, Idaho’s government contracting law, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Optum’s lawsuit was dismissed in the Idaho Supreme Court in 2024. Last week, the Idaho Supreme Court ruled on Beacon’s appeal.
“… We hold the State Procurement Act does not violate the Idaho Constitution’s separation of power’s doctrine,” the Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 18. 
Beacon’s national affiliate, Carelon Behavioral Health, could not be immediately reached for comment. 
In a statement Monday, Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said the state Supreme Court “reinforced the authority of the Idaho Legislature to define when district courts may review agency actions of the executive branch.”
“As my office argued and the Court concluded, such authority is vested in the legislative branch by the Idaho Constitution,” Labrador said. “If Carelon had prevailed, losing bidders in government contracts could drag the state into court over every major contract and ask judges to second-guess agency decisions and invalidate billion-dollar agreements that Idahoans depend on for health care, roads, and critical services.”
As Idaho faces a projected budget shortfall, the contractor Magellan has cut critical mental health services. The contract to run Idaho Medicaid mental health services is called the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan.

Critics argue the policy has far-reaching implications and undermines academic freedom. (Photo: courtesy of Naseem Rakha)Once upon a time I consulted with a local nonprofit that needed help revising a client satisfaction questionnaire. Years earlier, I had apprenticed as a survey researcher, so I knew how to do this sort of thing. It’s a craft like any other. I fixed several problems with the old questionnaire and drafted a new version that would yield better data. People in the organization were grateful and happily paid me for my work.
A few months later, my contact at the organization called to say that they were ready to deploy the questionnaire, but they hadn’t had time to make the changes I recommended. He wanted to know if I thought it would be okay to use the old version. We were on the phone, so he didn’t see me roll my eyes. I said that using the old version would likely reproduce the problems they’d encountered before, but it was entirely up to them to decide what to do. It was their questionnaire, their data, and their effectiveness at stake, hence their choice.
In that instance, I hoped that people in the organization would value my work and benefit from it. But I wasn’t invested in controlling the product. It was as if they’d brought me a lamp to fix; once the repair was done, it wasn’t up to me to say where or when it could be turned on. This is how it is with “works for hire,” or what are often called in university contexts “directed works.” The creator of the work, no matter the expertise involved, relinquishes control of the product to whoever paid for the work to be done.
I have never thought of a syllabus this way.   
Over the course of a 40-year teaching career, which included stints at a community college, two four-year colleges, and three research universities, no one ever suggested that the syllabi I created for my courses were works made for hire—with all that this implied. None of my colleagues, as far as I knew, thought of their syllabi as works for hire, either. Nor did any department chair, department head, dean, or other administrator ever suggest such a thing. Syllabi—the documents that describe what a course will cover, how it will unfold, and what students will be expected to do—were seen as the intellectual property of the instructors who created them. 
But now, under a new policy, this would no longer be true in the UNC System. Peter Hans, UNC System president, has said—with little prior consultation with faculty—that course syllabi will be considered directed works, copyrighted and owned by the UNC System, not the instructors who created them. To some, this might seem like a small change. After all, faculty don’t usually hoard their syllabi; in fact, we eagerly share them with colleagues and students. You’re interested in my course? Great! Here’s the syllabus. 
And yet, the impending UNC policy is cause for concern. Because of the far-reaching implications of defining syllabi as directed works—the same, in effect, as calling them works made for hire—this policy can be seen as a trojan horse, sneaked in the back door and potentially usable later as a tool for controlling course content and undermining academic freedom. 
As with the questionnaire I mentioned at the outset, the content, character, and use of works made for hire are the province of whoever commissions the work. If syllabi are defined as such works, the same legal principles would apply. University administrators could say what must be included or excluded, the form a syllabus must take, and how the syllabus can be used—perhaps even whether a faculty member can share it with others or allow it to be reprinted. All this becomes legally permissible if a syllabus is owned by the university. This would amount to an extraordinary transfer of control.
I grant that this is a slippery-slope argument, and that the slope might be less slippery than I fear. Perhaps nothing worse will happen going forward. Yet in the current political climate, fear is warranted. Consider that the directed works policy is part of a larger policy change that defines syllabi as public records that must be provided to any interested party. What prompted this change? A snooping mission by the Heritage Foundation, a DC-based right-wing outfit that aims to purge US education of anything that smacks of DEI, critical race theory, or “gender ideology,” or insufficiently reveres free-market fundamentalism.
There is nothing secret about this. 
In its widely publicized Project 2025 report, “Mandate for Leadership,” which has come to serve as a policy manual for the Trump administration, the Heritage Foundation is clear about wanting education at all levels in the US to promote free markets and other so-called American values, while denying oxygen to DEI, critical race theory, gender studies, and area studies. When Heritage Foundation personnel wanted to pore through the syllabi of UNC System faculty for evidence of heresy, they were initially daunted—because syllabi were not consistently defined as public records (e.g., at UNC-Greensboro, they were; at UNC-Chapel Hill, they were not). Peter Hans’s policy diktat will change this.
The Foundation’s “Mandate for Leadership” also includes this line: “[S]tates should require schools to post classroom materials online to provide maximum transparency to parents.” Although the new UNC System policies regarding syllabi do not go this far, they are a step in the same direction, in service to the same goal: making education great again for white supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism. As faculty objecting to the policy argued, making syllabi public isn’t really about transparency for the benefit of students, as Hans claims, but about making faculty and their courses easier targets for outside critics with an ideological agenda.  
If faculty revise their syllabi to avoid being targeted, critics will likely demand to see classroom materials, as the Heritage Foundation calls for. If the demand for “maximum transparency” applies to K-12 public schools, why not to public universities as well? If syllabi are public documents, why not an instructor’s PowerPoint slides or handouts? For that matter, why are these latter works—also created as part of an instructor’s job—any less works made for hire than a syllabus? It’s not that the sky is falling; it’s that the logic of how the sky can be made to fall is right in front of us and seems to be guiding policy-making in the UNC System.
In the end, outside critics of higher education might not get much traction; if protected by the formal rules and informal norms of academic freedom, faculty can ignore such criticism, if they so choose. But when syllabi are defined as works made for hire or directed works, the situation changes. Now the entity that commissioned the work—the employer, the university—gains the power to say what the work may include, must include, may exclude, and must exclude. Now we’re talking not just about grading rubrics and assignments but potentially about course content. This is the eventuality to which the trojan horse policy of defining syllabi as directed works could lead. Which would mean, to put it bluntly, the end of academic freedom.
In 2022, the board of governors of the Florida University System, political cousins to the UNC Board of Governors, claimed that speech by professors in public universities is “government speech,” therefore subject to regulation by government officials. Such regulation was further said to include university curricula and course content. It’s a nutty idea, one that the courts have so far rejected. But the idea that professors should be brought to heel and allowed to teach only what is congenial to the far right still has a heartbeat. Listen closely and you can hear it beneath the words “directed work.”

(StockPlanets/Getty Images)West Virginia schools are increasing their online safety training for students to educate children on the dangers of sharing sexually explicit photographs with others. 
In November, 15-year-old Kanawha County student Bryce Tate was found dead by a self-inflicted gunshot wound hours after he was targeted in an online sextortion scheme.
Predators, typically outside of the United States, coerce victims into taking and sending sexually explicit photos and videos then immediately demand payment or threaten to release the photo to the victim’s family and friends, according to the FBI. It is a financially motivated crime.
State lawmakers passed a bill in 2024 requiring public schools to implement an age-appropriate cyber security training program for children, known as the Cyber SWAT program, or Safety While Accessing Technology. The program would teach students about the long-term and unforeseen consequences of sharing sexually suggestive or sexually explicit materials and how sharing it could be connected to bullying, sextortion and human trafficking. 
Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio
Sen. Laura Chapman, R-Ohio, a sponsor of the bill, said that as a mother of two, she felt compelled to make sure West Virginia students know about the risks of sending nude photos online. It could lead to sextortion, she warned. 
“Kids feel like they have no options, they’re in a panic. Unfortunately, a lot of people in that situation do take their lives,” she said. “Those poor children didn’t know what to do, and probably had never heard of a situation like this.”
Prior to the legislation, the West Virginia Department of Education was already providing cyber awareness and security lessons, according to department spokesperson Christy Day. The Cyber SWAT program is a defined curriculum that has to be the same in all counties for students in third through 12th grade. 
“This is an online platform designed in a game format that allows children to experience various situations, some of which are very sensitive, and answer questions as to how they should handle them. As students answer correctly, they progress through the game.” Day explained.
The bill required that each county school board implement the SWAT education program beginning with the 2025-2026 school year. Day said the app was made available within the first semester of this school year. 
Language in the legislation required the SWAT education program to be based on specific learning and modeling concepts. The bill didn’t come with any new funding for the schools to implement the training. 
“The non-profit organization Safe Surfin’ Foundation and the company Skyll were the vendors that could meet the requirements listed above in the legislation,” Day said. “Due to the sensitive nature of the content, several rounds of testing and revisions were necessary to provide age-appropriate content to children at both the elementary and secondary levels while also meeting the requirements of the legislation. The build and testing phase required extensive testing and revisions to ensure the game would provide the necessary learning experience within the context of mature subject matter.”
“Once this was achieved, the app was made available during the first semester of the 2025-26 school year,” she continued.
Chapman, who amended the bill to include an implementation date, hoped the program would be rolled out swiftly in hopes of preventing any future student tragedies. 
She said the bill provided “a toolkit for these students who are in this situation to know where to turn, to know how to report it, to know that they themselves are not going to be in trouble.”
West Virginia lawmakers this year passed legislation banning cell phones in classrooms — an initiative requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey. County boards of education were required to create and adopt a policy that includes whether cellphones are permitted on school grounds and what the consequence would be for students who violate the policy. 
Day said West Virginia public schools “want to support communities and families in providing safe environments for children regardless of whether they are inside of or outside of the school building.”

Bill Lee has been silent on his plans  (Photo: Getty Images)As a deadline looms for states to opt into a federal program to feed low-income kids during the summer, Gov. Bill Lee has yet to announce whether Tennessee will participate.
States have until Jan. 1 to decide whether they will give families with children the opportunity to draw on the federal nutrition program funding in 2026. 
Last year, citing rising administrative costs to the state, Lee made the decision to forgo Tennessee’s participation in Summer EBT, rejecting $84 million in federal funding allocated to feed more than 700,000 Tennessee children living in poverty during summer break, when in-school free and reduced costs breakfast and lunch are not available.
Lee has thus far declined to reveal his decision about whether Tennessee will rejoin the program, known as SUN Bucks, for the summer of 2026. The governor’s office did not respond to emailed questions Monday.
Meanwhile child advocates, faith leaders and elected officials have urged the governor to rejoin the Summer EBT program, citing the urgent need to address child nutrition in Tennessee, where one in five under the age of 18 face hunger.
Tennessee launches its summer food benefits this week. Most students in the state will miss out.

On Monday, a letter signed by 314 faith leaders across Tennessee urged Lee to rejoin the food program.
“To refuse federal partnership which can address that hunger is morally wrong, economically insane, and constitutionally inconsistent with the peace, safety, and happiness of the people,” said Rev. Gordon Myers, a retired Lutheran pastor from Memphis who signed onto the letter.
County mayors have also urged Lee to participate in the program.
“With the state’s decision to opt out of the federal Summer EBT program, families have lost access to a crucial benefit — $120 per eligible child — that helps pay for groceries when school cafeterias are closed,” a letter to Lee signed by more than 30 Tennessee county mayors said.
“Summer should be a time of joy, not hunger. Yet, this year, too many Tennessee children are going without the meals they need,” they wrote.



				Mayors asking for Gov. Bill Lee to opt into Summer EBT are those from Bedford, Campbell, Cannon, Chester, Claiborne, Clay, Coffee, Crockett, Dyer, Franklin, Gibson, Hancock, Hardeman, Hawkins, Jackson, Jefferson, Lewis, Lincoln, Marion, Marshall, Maury, Moore, Morgan, Pickett, Polk, Rhea, Smith, Stewart, White and Wilson. 			


In a separate letter to the governor, Sen. Lamar London, a Memphis Democrat, called the Summer EBT program “a commonsense way to make sure kids don’t go hungry just because school is out. These funds help parents stretch tight grocery budgets and this shopping supports our supermarkets and state economy.”
Republican states reject EBT
The Summer EBT program was established by the Biden administration in 2023 as pandemic-era food programs wound down.
Akin to food stamps, SUN Bucks provide families a debit card loaded with cash to use at the grocery store during the months that in-school meals aren’t available. Parents who meet the low-income requirements received $40 per month per child.
In 2024, more than a dozen Republican governors rejected Summer EBT funding, citing reasons ranging from administrative costs to opposition to “attempts to expand the welfare state.”
Lee also announced in 2024 that the state would forgo the funding beginning in 2025, citing administrative costs. In 2024 the state spent $5 million to administer the program. 
But after facing blowback for opting out of the program, Lee launched a smaller state-funding pilot program. 
Lee’s Summer Nutrition Initiative last summer operated in 15 counties, providing 18,000 students the same per-child funding as the federal program: $120 for each child for a total state expenditure of $3 million in the selected counties. 
Children in Tennessee’s other 80 counties, including the state’s urban centers in Shelby and Davidson, weren’t eligible.
National advocates have noted that Summer EBT, which brings in a flow of federal cash for low-income families to spend at Tennessee grocery stores, has an economic impact beyond dinner tables. 
The 2024 economic impact of Summer EBT in Tennessee, before Lee rejected the funding, was more than $115 million, according to the Food Research & Action Center.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Dozens of children, some dressed as angels, shepherds, and farm animals, stood flanked by twinkling blue and white lights as they sang Ukrainian Christmas carols at a Raleigh church recently.
Nearly four years ago, many of the children on stage were forced to flee their homes as Russian forces swept into Ukraine and drone strikes turned their neighborhoods to rubble. For some, it was their first opportunity to share in the cultural tradition of Vertep with other Ukrainian families since leaving home.
Held on Saint Nicholas Day, Dec. 6, Vertep marks the start of weeks of yuletide celebration in Ukraine. The performance is what Ukraine House founder Iryna Borodina describes as a “Ukrainian interpretation” of the nativity play, full of traditional folk songs and characters unique to the country. It’s the first time her organization has held the performance for Raleigh families.
Formed in the wake of the invasion, Ukraine House provides a Saturday school at Ridge Road Baptist Church in Raleigh where around 30 children learn Ukrainian art, history and language skills as well as activities like choir, guitar lessons, and ballet.
Parents say it is a crucial connection to the home their children were forced to leave behind. Some had lost much of their ability to read, write, and speak Ukrainian, more accustomed to English in day-to-day life. Others left at such an early age they never learned those skills in the first place.
“We left when [my daughter] was eight years old, so it was like second grade, and now she speaks English very well, more than Ukrainian,” said Yuliia Sytnyk, an art curator from Kherson who teaches at the Saturday school. “For kids, it seems like they get used to everything so fast, but of course it’s hard, all these changes.”

‘Each person tries to give something’
When Iryna Yermolaieva fled the war in Ukraine with her family, her oldest daughter had not yet started grade school. She did not know how to read and write in Ukrainian.
Traveling from place to place in Europe searching for refuge, there was no opportunity for her daughter to attend a Ukrainian school. It was only after coming to Raleigh that her child finally got the opportunity to become literate in her family’s language.
“We started attending classes in Ukrainian school, and in just a few months, she started reading Ukrainian,” Yermolaieva said. “She writes better than even me and my husband. Her handwriting is so perfect.”
Halyna Seredyuk, a longtime Ukrainian educator in the U.S. and overseas, was a big part of that journey. She has taught for 40 years, first as a high school teacher in Ukraine and then through Ukrainian Saturday schools abroad, including in Sweden and for roughly 20 years in Atlanta.

Seredyuk creates her own lesson plans, weaving in traditional Ukrainian proverbs such as Bdzhola mala, a y ta pratsyuye (“The bee is small, but it works too”). She brings back a big bag of handmade notebooks for the children every time she returns from a trip to Ukraine.
“They are reading, they are writing, they are talking,” Seredyuk said.
Though Yermolaieva’s daughter came to the school two months after classes began, Seredyuk worked one-on-one with her to get her up to speed. “She helped us so much,” Yermolaieva said.
Now, Yermolaieva volunteers her own time as a substitute teacher as many of the other parents do.“Each person tries to give something,” she said.
Yermolaieva said her daughters have made fast friends at the school. Her youngest, turning five years old this month, invited all of her classmates from the Ukrainian school to her birthday party.
“She just started [learning the] alphabet, a little bit of reading, art,” she said. “I hope everything will work out like with my oldest.”
At its core, she said, the school has provided an opportunity for her kids to experience their culture that she will be forever grateful for.
“I hope that this school will stay here for a long, long, long time and will help a lot of Ukrainian kids to know better their culture, language and history,” Yermolaieva said.
‘We need to build a new life’
Sytnyk, the former curator who teaches art at the school, feels she has no home to return to. “I don’t miss my home because I know that around, everything is destroyed,” she said.
Kherson’s population has fallen from nearly 300,000 to roughly one-fifth of that, with much of the city laid to waste under Russian occupation. Even two years after its liberation by Ukrainian troops, the city faces hundreds of drone attacks every week.

“Nothing exists right now, and we cannot come back [to] our life,” Sytnyk said. “That’s why we need to build a new life, and how it will be, it’s only God knows.”
Since coming to the U.S., Sytnyk has worked to keep the arts of Ukraine alive through visual and musical exhibits and hands-on workshops with institutions like UNC Chapel Hill, Carnegie Hall, and Yale.
One project she’s proudest of is a virtual tour of the vibrant home of Kherson artist Polina Raiko, its interior blanketed with painted representations of the artist’s grief. The home, a national cultural monument, was destroyed by floodwaters in 2023, after Russian soldiers destroyed a nearby dam.
She learned about the Saturday school program through Ukrainians in the Carolinas, a nonprofit that sprang up during the war to support the more than 2,000 refugees who have come to the state from Ukraine. As a teacher, she has brought her cultural expertise to the classroom.
Like Seredyuk, she has developed her own lesson plans for the classes at Ukraine House with the goal of connecting the children with their home country through its art. She also teaches a class for adults, open to Ukrainians as well as Americans who wish to better understand the country and its culture.
For a workshop on Petrykivka painting, a distinct floral pattern of painting originating from a village in Ukraine, she said some Ukrainian attendees came from as far as Wilmington.
“They said, ‘We don’t have anything about Ukraine, no events, nothing that we want to share with our kids,’” Sytnyk said.
“The parents want their kids to know about Ukraine and know their history, their culture, and it’s really important,” Sytnyk said. “Some people understood it only here when they’re so far from Ukraine.”
‘I live for two countries’
Under Borodina’s watch, the Ukrainian school has grown from a single weekly language class in 2022 to a full-fledged Saturday school, with four classes a day for everyone from preschoolers to fifth and sixth graders.
Borodina sees her work not as building an enclave for Ukrainians in the Triangle, but as creating a bridge between two nations.

“This school is a part of our war to save and preserve our culture,” Borodina said. “We do not want to allow our culture to disappear even in the USA, because Russia, for example, in this war declared that we are not existing, and our culture is not existing culture.”
In her view, the war has forced Ukraine to become a “global nation.” She is in communication with Ukrainian schools from all around the world, from North Carolina to Germany, aimed at raising a generation of children fluent in the cultures of their native and adopted countries — future ambassadors in a world where Ukraine must work alongside countries across the globe to defend itself and rebuild.
“Right now, I live for two countries,” she said. “This is my mission.”
But she’s troubled by a year of sometimes hostile rhetoric by President Donald Trump toward Ukraine’s government and deep uncertainty over the future immigration status of Ukrainian refugees in the U.S.
Unlike some families who belong to Ukraine House, Borodina does not wish for her children to remain in the United States indefinitely.
“I would like my children to come back to Ukraine,” she said. “Actually, I would like other American children to come back to Ukraine, because they are our heritage.”
She said she had plans to found a secondary school for Ukrainians that could serve a similar purpose in North Carolina, but abandoned those plans after Trump made it clear he would take a hardline stance on refugees.
But the school she leads and the welcoming community within it will persist, she says.
“I believe this Saturday school will live even without me,” Borodina said. “We [Ukrainians] used to help each other ourselves, always, and this is our history.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PB155044-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-23 06:12:15.551186

(Photo: Gabrielle Nelson/Buffalo’s Fire)RYDER, N.D.,  — Tyler Stafslien is a fourth-generation farmer who’s worked his family’s land in central North Dakota for about 20 years. Roughly half of his 2,500 acres are typically dedicated to soybeans, a major crop in the state and in the Mississippi River Basin. But growing soybeans has become less profitable over the last decade as input costs rose and the Trump administration’s tariff negotiations in 2018 and 2025 destabilized trade and strained farmers’ incomes. 
This year, wary of the precarious export market, Stafslien decreased his soybean acres by half.
“We’ve been experiencing in ag, the last couple of years, a downturn in commodity prices, a lot of that related to just a large supply across the globe of major commodities, but then you add this trade war on top of it, and it’s like the icing on the cake,” Stafslien said.
The administration announced on Dec. 8 a $12 billion fund for one-time payments to row crop farmers to offset a portion of their inflation- and trade-related losses in the 2025 crop year.
Farmers were asking for the federal relief funds and are happy the administration is finally answering, said Stafslien. But he’s still facing uncertainty. The administration has yet to announce how much money per acre eligible growers will be receiving, and the funds will not be distributed until February, further stressing farmers like him with large debt and growing interest.
“Payments announced this week must be followed by additional and expedient efforts to keep farmers on the land and to improve the farm safety net, leaving annual bailouts as cautionary historical context rather than ongoing policy,” David Howard, policy development director of the National Young Farmers Coalition, wrote in a statement Dec. 9. 
Farmers and farming associations are looking for longer term solutions: to diversify trade partners and increase domestic uses for soybeans as export revenues become less certain. Some, like Stafslien, are shifting to other crops, like corn and wheat.
Soybeans are the largest agricultural export in the U.S. The legume covers more than 81 million acres — or 10% — of all U.S. farmland, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported in September, and more than 40% of the nation’s soybeans are exported to other countries. 

U.S. farmers received $24.5 billion from soybean exports in 2024, with Chinese purchases accounting for $12.6 billion – roughly twice the amount purchased by the next five largest export partners combined, according to USDA data.
But this year, China stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans during tariff negotiations with the Trump administration, instead falling back on its relationships with Brazil and other South American countries to meet its soybean needs. For U.S. soybean farmers, this growing season ends with low prices, unsold harvests, big financial losses and uncertainty going into the next season despite a tentative new deal with China. 
“We learned firsthand that being heavily reliant on China for export sales is only good when things are good,” University of Tennessee Professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics Andrew Muhammad said.
How did we get here?
Soybeans brought by traders and missionaries from Asia first took root in North America in small quantities in the 1700s, but the USDA did not begin tracking soybeans as a crop until the early 1920s. 
Around that time, the USDA, land grant university extension agents and farm groups started to promote the soybean to farmers as a soil-fertilizing crop that yielded high-protein meal for animal feed, oil, and even meat replacements for human consumption. The Mississippi River Basin’s flat plains and intermittent rain proved to be ideal conditions for the crop. 
Soybeans gained a foothold on U.S. farms in “fits and starts” over several decades, author Matthew Roth writes in his book, “Magic Bean: The Rise of Soy in America,” but really took off as a cash crop after World War I. Its success was later buoyed by the Agricultural Adjustment Act that allowed soy plantings while restricting other commodities as a way to stabilize crop prices during the Great Depression, policies limiting foreign oils, and the growing need for animal feed and oil during World War II, according to Roth.
The crop helped diversify farming in the south and midwest. By the 1960s, Roth writes, “the soybean had insinuated itself thoroughly into the American diet,” but indirectly – as feed for the country’s livestock, oils for salads and derivatives in processed foods.

At the same time, soybeans proved to be a desirable product for international trade partners. In 1989, U.S. soybean exports totaled around $4 billion, about a fifth of which went to Japan. The Freedom to Farm Act in 1996 allowed farmers to plant single-crop fields, and with rising export demand from China starting in the early 1990s, many farmers chose to plant soybeans, Roth wrote.
In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization and gained better access to globalized trade with the organization’s members, including the U.S., according to Muhammad and the Council on Foreign Relations. From there, growth in China’s tourism economy and middle class spurred increased demand for meat protein, Muhammad said, heightening the country’s need for animal feed in the form of U.S. soybeans. 


 

By 2000, the crop was planted on more than 74 million U.S. acres, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service.
“Over time, China has grown, and it seems to be the case that our total export sales have grown with our exports to China,” Muhammad explained. “They’ve sort of driven that rise over the last two decades.”
Brazil’s soybean industry has competed with American exports since the 1970s, but since 2017 has consistently exported more than the U.S. 
When Trump first upped tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018, China retaliated, Muhammad said, and began investing more heavily in purchases and transportation infrastructure in Brazil. Their turn toward Brazil as a primary provider during trade negotiations in 2025 “represents a return on that investment (for China),” he said.
Farmers in the U.S. are reckoning with the fallout. 
Farming pains and changing plans
Justin Sherlock farms 2,400 acres of corn and soybeans in eastern North Dakota. His dad started farming in the early 2000s and he took over the farm in 2012.
“The last, you know, 13 years that I’ve been going, the last decade, has been pretty tough to really try and get established,” he said. 
For Sherlock, China coming to market very late in the 2025 harvest season was a blow to profits. Nearly one-quarter of the state’s agricultural exports hinge on soybeans, with China serving as the largest market for U.S. grain.
Sherlock was able to sell most of his soybean crop early to North Dakota soybean elevators — facilities that store the beans — which then found domestic processors in Nebraska and Kansas to sell to. But those domestic markets were also absorbing the supply that would typically be exported to China, so prices — around $8.65 per bushel — dropped significantly below Sherlock’s cost of production. He said he will lose “several hundred thousands of dollars” this year, on top of similar losses last year. 
“We just have to find a way to hopefully make it to next year,” he said. “That’s the struggle right now for a lot of producers.” 
Especially for young or beginning producers, said Sherlock, farmers will likely be having “tough financial discussions with their bankers and lenders.” Or, worst case scenario, these losses could mean losing their farms.
“You cannot have a successful agriculture industry in North Dakota without trade,” he said. “It’s so important that we fix these trade relationships and get back to doing business with other countries.” 

Trade uncertainty was keenly felt by soybean farmers in several Mississippi River Basin states, many of which lead the nation in soybean production and exports. 
Illinois accounts for 16% of the country’s total soybean exports, followed by Iowa with 13%, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service. North Dakota comprises 5% of national exports.
Even in states that aren’t among the country’s top producers, soybeans can make up a significant portion of the state farm economy. Tennessee ranks 16th in the nation for soybean exports, for example, but soybeans were the highest-ranked agricultural commodity produced in the state in 2023, bringing in more than $990 million in cash receipts. In 2025, soybeans covered nearly 1.5 million acres of Tennessee farmland – the most of any crop in the state – according to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture.
The USDA’s Economic Research Service reported in July that more soybeans are being processed domestically. Most of the soybeans that stay in the U.S. are crushed into oil and meal, and a majority of that meal goes toward feeding livestock. The oil is used in biofuels, for industrial uses, and in food. New crush facilities that separate the beans into oil and meal are under construction in North Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas and Ohio — states that previously shipped soybeans to other countries to be processed. Biofuel has increased domestic demand for soybeans — and crush facilities — since around 2010, providing an alternative for farmers facing lower demand from traditional export partners.
April Hemmes, a fourth-generation farmer in north-central Iowa, said in September that she is fortunate to have nearby options for her beans: there is an ethanol plant and a crush facility that makes soybean meal, biodiesel and food-grade oil, about 10 miles away from her farm. Farmers who don’t have those options will have a harder time adapting to changing export markets, she wrote in an email.
The lack of money in farmers’ pockets is trickling down to other sectors in farming communities, too, said John Bartman, a regenerative farmer working about 850 acres in northern Illinois. He pointed to farm equipment dealers and factories in Illinois and Iowa that are shuttering well-paying jobs because business has been so slow. 
“So it’s more than just farmers who have been affected by this,” Bartman said. 
What comes next? 
In October, China and the U.S. hammered out a trade agreement. China agreed to purchase at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the year, according to the White House, and will purchase at least 25 million metric tons each year through 2028. USDA export sales data from Oct. 2 through Dec. 8 shows China made soybean purchases from the U.S. totaling about 2.8 million metric tons.
For comparison, China purchased an annual average of 29 million metric tons of soybeans from the United States between 2020 and 2024, according to The Center for Strategic and International Studies, an international public policy think tank.
The deal “really isn’t much of a trade deal at all,” Bartman said.
“We’ve just gone through this tariff war, which we’re still going through right now, and what did we get out of it? China agreed to buy less soybeans than what we had last year, and we as farmers have suffered the collateral damage from this,” Bartman said.
With low trade prices and higher input costs, he warned, “we have not improved our economic situation for next year.”
Bartman is among farmers who are promoting investment in domestic uses for soybeans, including biofuels and plastics, though he acknowledges that a market the size of China’s will be “very difficult” to replace.
Muhammad said the turbulence in the soybean exports market shows that disruption of stable trade policy has consequences, which can hurt some sectors more than others.
The U.S. agriculture sector is often a political target in trade disputes, he said, because other countries understand the agricultural community’s significance in U.S. politics.
“It’s not a major export in the context of all exports, but it’s a politically viable community, and it carries a lot of heft in the context of trade agreements and trade policy because of the national security nature of food,” Muhammad said.
Farmers who are eligible for the Trump administration’s $12 billion Farmer Bridge Assistance program should expect the USDA to announce payment rates for crops the week of Dec. 22, according to the department. Payments are limited to up to $155,000 per person or legal entity.
The program appears similar to a $10 billion aid package offered to farmers impacted by trade retaliation in 2018. Those subsidies did not cover all of farmers’ losses. 
For many farmers like Sherlock, these subsidies are a necessity for short-term survival. He said any farming subsidies he receives go straight to paying his bills and paying off loans.
“There will be a lot of producers, especially young, beginning producers, who won’t be able to make it and farm next year if we don’t do something to help them pay their bills from this year,” he said.
Even established producers are worried. Stafslien works land that’s been in his family since 1912, but the tough years are piling up. 
“This is my future. This is my retirement. I don’t have a 401k plan. I have a farm,” said Stafslien, who lives on the farm with his wife, Shannon, and their two kids. “If I have to keep burning through this equity, that’s very, very scary for my future and my family’s future.”

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s top oil regulator is pessimistic about oil prices for 2026 but says oil production should hold steady, due in part to new drilling technology companies are using to remain profitable.
“Every time somebody thinks that the industry is essentially kind of maxed out on their technical capabilities, they usually come through with some type of innovation,” said Nathan Anderson, director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources.
North Dakota produced nearly 1.17 million barrels of oil per day in October, the most recent figure available. The market price of North Dakota crude oil averaged about $53 that month, close to the bare minimum producers need to make a profit and a drop of $14 per barrel since January.
“Operators generally have shut down or slowed down activity in the past at those levels,” Anderson said. “What we’re seeing now is these activity levels are continuing to maintain where they’re at in spite of that.”
North Dakota, the No. 3 oil producer in the nation, relies on oil and gas tax revenue for much of the state budget. The state maintains a revenue forecast to track that, based on oil production and fluctuations in prices. Oil production is nearly 2% above the state’s revenue forecast for the 2025-27 budget cycle, while the price was nearly 10% below forecast in October.

There are 27 drilling rigs active in North Dakota, compared to 37 a year ago at this time. The number of hydraulic fracturing crews dipped from 13 to seven in recent weeks, which Anderson said is partially due to budget constraints at the end of a calendar year. He expects activity will pick up in January. 
“Some of them are actually increasing activity,” Anderson said. “Each company has a slightly different business model on how they operate.”
One reason North Dakota oil production is stable, despite the dip in oil activity, is companies are drilling longer horizontal wells. Oil wells drilled in the Bakken typically drill vertically until they hit the Bakken rock formation about 2 miles underground, then curve horizontally for 2 miles. The surrounding rock is then fractured, or fracked, to release the oil. 
But companies are now drilling farther horizontally. More than 1,000 permits have been issued for wells that are drilled horizontally for 3 miles instead of 2. That accounts for 30% of all wells being completed, according to Department of Mineral Resources data. 
Some companies took it a step further in 2024 and began drilling horizontally for 4 miles. There have been 105 permits awarded for wells of that length, a fifth of which have been drilled and completed. 
These longer wells have made it economically feasible to drill in areas outside of the Bakken core, where wells are typically most productive. That has prompted more activity in areas like Divide County, Burke County and southern McKenzie County, Joel Brown, mineral services manager at Mineral Tracker, a subsidiary of First International Bank and Trust, said during a presentation this month.
Brown collected production data for wells in a portion of northern Mountrail County, one of those less productive regions, and shared his findings with the Board of University and School Lands. The typical Bakken wells produced 200,000 barrels of oil within an average of 46 months, and the 3-mile wells hit that mark in 22 months. 
The one well he analyzed that drilled for 4 miles horizontally in the area reached the milestone in eight months, Brown said. 
State-owned minerals projected to generate $8 billion in future royalty payments

The 200,000-barrel milestone is approximately when a well will “pay off,” said Gov. Kelly Armstrong, chair of the five-member board. If a company can recoup its investment quicker, then it can re-allocate those funds to a second well location, he said.
“Cash flow is their problem,” Armstrong said. “If they can pay off a well in eight months, they can drill more wells.”
The increased value offered by longer wells was evident this fall when the state held its highest-grossing auction of oil and gas rights in 14 years. The Department of Trust Lands, which manages state-owned minerals held in trust for the public, holds two lease sales a year. The October 2025 auction involved 64,000 acres and collected $49.5 million for the state.
“That acreage is now way more valuable than they previously thought in the past,” said Chris Suelzle, director of minerals management for the Department of Trust Lands. “You’re getting more out of a 3- or 4-mile lateral in your rate of return because you just don’t have to spend as much money.”
Those cost efficiencies will be particularly important while oil prices remain low. Anderson told lawmakers earlier in December he is pessimistic that oil prices will recover any time soon due to a combination of factors, including global oversupply. 
That oversupply is the primary factor contributing to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s price outlook for 2026. The agency’s data projects the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil to remain in the low $50s per barrel for all of 2026.
“It just doesn’t lend itself to me being bullish on oil prices in 2026,” Anderson said on Dec. 19. “I’m bearish probably for the next 12 months.”
The price of North Dakota oil will be slightly lower. North Dakota oil production is sold at a slight discount relative to West Texas Intermediate, factoring in the cost of transportation and refinery demand. The average discount in December was $6.61 per barrel according to North Dakota Pipeline Authority data.

The state’s SNAP ban includes regular soda, diet soda and zero-calorie soda, but does not include water, milk, juice and energy drinks. The state defines soda as “any carbonated, non-alcoholic beverage that contains water, a sweetening agent, flavoring, and carbon dioxide gas to create carbonation.
The Trump administration approved West Virginia’s SNAP soda ban waiver along with that of several other states this year. 
The SNAP changes are one part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. West Virginia was one of the first states in the nation to pass a sweeping ban of artificial dyes in foods sold in grocery stores and restaurants, another part of the MAHA agenda. The state also banned the use of some artificial food dyes in school lunches.
The SNAP soda ban is also part of a health initiative from Gov. Patrick Morrisey called the “Four Pillars of a Healthy West Virginia.” Other pillars included prohibiting the sale of certain food dyes in the state, and the “Mountaineer Mile” challenge to walk at least a mile a day. The governor has said the changes are “long overdue.”
“I’m happy now that in West Virginia, taxpayers are not going to be subsidizing soda and these sugary drinks — things that have no nutritional value and are directly linked to obesity, diabetes, a lot of other terrible health care outcomes,” Morrisey said during a news conference in August. 
Retailers who accept SNAP have been required to change their point of sale systems, which can cost up to thousands of dollars, Traci Nelson, president of the West Virginia Oil Marketers and Grocers Association told West Virginia Watch over the summer. 
Speaking to reporters last week, West Virginia Department of Human Services Secretary Alex Mayer said the department has been working with the state retailers association and federal Department of Agriculture to prepare for the change. 
“We meet with the Retailers Association regularly,” Mayer said. “So, what the team has been telling me is that the retailers are on board, and that there’s been progress, and that there’s been no indication that they’re not going to be prepared for that Jan. 1 date.”
Representatives for the West Virginia Retailer’s Association and the West Virginia Oil Marketers and Grocers Association did not return an email seeking comment last week. 
Critics of restricting the use of SNAP benefits argue the bans may negatively impact the businesses of state retailers, particularly for retailers located along the state borders. SNAP recipients in border counties may cross state lines to purchase soda, taking business away from West Virginia retailers.
About one in six West Virginians receive SNAP benefits. The benefits equal less than $6 per day per person, according to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. In 2024, SNAP brought more than $500 million in federal food benefits to about 2,200 authorized West Virginia SNAP retailers, the center said. 
The state Department of Humans Services told West Virginia Watch it will not enforce the ban on out-of-state soda purchases. 
“SNAP applicants, and applicants for all benefit programs administered by the West Virginia Department of Human Services (DoHS), have always been required to sign the Rights & Responsibilities form,” Angelica Hightower, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services, wrote in an email. “Soda will be designated as a non-eligible item under West Virginia’s newly approved waiver, however, the [Rights and Responsibilities] form does not reference or apply to purchases made in other states.”
West Virginia’s SNAP waiver allows the state to restrict soda for two years, ending Dec. 31, 2027. The state may request three annual extensions after that for a total of up to five years. As part of the evaluation process, the state will collect responses to a survey about the ban next year.

Most Idaho families struggle to find behavioral health care. Providers are scarce, waitlists are long and the number of young people experiencing trauma, depression and anxiety is rising. 
Idaho is widely known as a mental health care desert. Nonprofits are hit especially hard, losing counselors to organizations that can simply pay more. We believe that can change. 
Philanthropy can help spark progress. These three nonprofit organizations are some of the oldest in the state. They bring decades of experience, deep relationships with Idaho families, and an unwavering commitment to helping kids heal. 
For just as long, they have confronted the provider shortage individually. Now with our help, they are choosing to collaborate, combining their experience and insight to pursue solutions that no single organization could take on by itself. At the foundation, our role is to help make that collaboration possible. 
Our support is not about handouts. It’s about hand-ups. We aim to be an accelerant — a partner that helps remove barriers, expand opportunity, and give nonprofit leaders room to pursue innovative approaches. Our job is to stand behind them with long-term support and help them speak with a shared, stronger voice. This is patient work. The challenges are generations deep, and meaningful change rarely happens quickly. But we believe in long bets, especially when they are placed on thoughtful, competent leaders who put Idaho’s children first. 
This work fits squarely within the long arc of our mission. For nearly 60 years, the foundation has invested in opportunities that help Idahoans learn, grow and thrive. Education has always been a central focus because it is the most reliable pathway to opportunity. 
But a child cannot learn if they are not mentally healthy. Families cannot stabilize when support is out of reach. When we follow the journey of a young person, mental health is not an adjacent issue. It is foundational. 
We have supported these nonprofits for many years, and we have seen firsthand what happens when a child gets the right help at the right moment. Healing becomes possible. Futures open. Families find their footing again. 
It is a privilege to support the people and organizations doing this work every day. We believe in these nonprofits, and if this vital effort matters to you, they’re worthy of your support. Their dedication reflects the same belief that guided Joe Albertson. When capable leaders and the community come together, aligned in purpose and committed to Idaho’s kids, nothing is impossible.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS — High school senior Talia Joseph was taking a test at St. Mary’s Academy when she got a call saying that her family members had seen immigration enforcement officers in their neighborhood in Gretna.
Joseph is an American citizen but ever since the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s immigration crackdown has begun in greater New Orleans, she said she has been worried about her family members who are not. Joseph said she has undocumented relatives on both sides of her family. Her father’s family is from Grenada and her mother’s is from Honduras.
“I was just thinking, what if it’s the last time that I see them?” Joseph said. “I found it hard to finish my schoolwork, and I was just spiraling the whole day, just wondering what was going to happen.”
No one in her family was detained that day, but she still worries about what will happen next time.
The immigration sweeps coincided with Joseph’s exams. But when she normally would have been studying, she has been spending much of her time finding resources to help her community. She said she’s looked into food delivery resources for families that are afraid to leave their homes, and legal services to prepare for the worst-case scenario.
Looking out for her community, she said, is just “a part of life.”

Cristiane Rosales-Fajardo, founder of El Pueblo NOLA, said Operation Catahoula Crunch has taken a toll on student well-being. Older students are finding it hard to focus on exams and college applications, she said.
“Children are enduring a lot of the fear,” Rosales-Fajardo said.
And although Joseph feels safe going to school, attendance data suggests that other students may not. Attendance at schools across the area has dropped dramatically since the start of the immigration crackdown. In Jefferson Parish, where 39% of students are Hispanic, attendance was almost 9 percentage points lower than it was immediately after Thanksgiving break in 2024, according to district data obtained by Verite News. Rates have risen since then, but are still lower than they were last year. In New Orleans, attendance rates across 17 schools, especially those with higher Hispanic populations had also dropped from last school year, data shows.
The drops follow trends seen in Chicago and Charlotte during operations in those cities earlier this year. Although DHS has repeatedly said that it does not target schools, agents have been seen around schools in the greater New Orleans area before and after the operation began. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment Friday (Dec. 19) about how actions affect children or schools. 
Under a Biden-era rule schools used to be a protected “sensitive location” largely off-limits to immigration agents, but the Trump administration reversed those protections in January. A number of school leaders in the area have said that federal immigration agents will not be allowed into schools unless they have court warrants, but many families in the area are worried about encountering agents on the path between school and home.
“There’s no policy or procedure for when you know there’s a military-style operation in your neighborhood,” said Neil Ranu, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center. “So we’re asking schools to account for the reality of what’s going on and to make accommodations.”

Even children with legal status aren’t attending school, said Angela Ramirez, executive director of youth support group, Puentes New Orleans, given reports of agents detaining citizens and those with legal status.
“Even if these kids were usually or would usually be secure or safe, that’s not the case anymore, and that’s why, even if they have their documents in order, parents don’t want to send them to school,” Ramirez said.
Genesis, a 15-year-old who attends high school in New Orleans, was one of the thousands of students who did not go to school the first week after Thanksgiving break. She prefers to only use her first name for fear of retaliation against her and her family.
Genesis said her mother usually takes her to school. But when the operation began, her mother, who is from Honduras, stopped leaving the house and going to work. Genesis requested instructional materials from teachers, and said school administration was fairly accommodating of her situation. A volunteer started taking her to school two weeks ago, and she was able to submit all the work she had missed to her teachers.
“I do feel way better than I’m now back in school, and I can distract myself,” Genesis said. “I just feel a little better, but I still worry about my mom.”
In the classroom, the difference after Thanksgiving break was obvious, Ramirez said. At one of Puentes’ sessions in a New Orleans school, only three out of 23 enrolled students attended.
“It was evident that they were disengaged and they were concerned and frustrated at the same time,” Ramirez said. “And this is something you can easily assess and you can easily perceive when you walk into a classroom.”
Students and community members who work closely with them have said that they’ve seen an increase in stress and anxiety among young people. Not going to school can take a toll on their mental health and overall learning, Ramirez said.
Genesis’ teachers’ understanding, she said, eased some of her anxiety. The Jefferson Parish school district did not respond to requests for comment on whether they have or will offer alternative, online learning for students missing school. Charter school leaders in Orleans Parish would not speak publicly about alternative learning options. The NOLA Public Schools district did not respond to requests for comment on how the operation has affected students and staff.
The Southern Poverty Law Center and other civil rights groups submitted a letter this week to public school systems in southeast Louisiana asking that they consider offering accommodations for vulnerable students. Those accommodations would include excusing absences for Hispanic students who are afraid to leave their homes and offering online instructional material to make sure they don’t fall behind in school. Ranu, who signed the letter, said the response could be similar to emergency responses that were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Students who miss extended amounts of school will not only miss out on learning and socialization, but can also end up in legal trouble or expulsion. But districts, Ranu said, have the discretion to excuse absences and save families the trouble of dealing with truancy hearings.
Some students who have stayed home from school for fear of immigration raids have already received warning letters, said Rosales-Fajardo. Verite News obtained a copy of one sent to a student for missing five days of school, sent by the Einstein Charter School network. Einstein did not respond to phone calls with requests for comment.
Ranu said that families shouldn’t panic if they receive a notice in the mail. Some schools, Ranu said, have an automated system for sending out attendance warning letters. Parents should send a note to their child’s school to explain that they fear for their safety, he said.

Our reporting in 2025 shed light on major policy issues both new and old that have rattled cities like Holyoke, Leominster, and Lynn.","THIS YEAR, CommonWealth Beacon ramped up its coverage of Massachusetts’ former industrial cities by adding a new Gateway Cities reporter role in its newsroom. These 26 cities, which anchor regional economies around the state yet suffer from the long-term decline of manufacturing, have long faced a host of barriers to adequate schools, health care access, housing development, and more.  
These are communities where targeted resources, policy solutions, and revitalization efforts have the potential to strengthen and revive once-flourishing parts of the state. But policymakers, researchers, and local leaders agree that there is more work to be done.  
This year, our reporting shed light on major policy issues both new and old that have rattled Gateway Cities like Holyoke, Leominster, and Lynn. Some of the issues covered are longstanding, such as Holyoke’s struggle to convert vacant, blighted properties into much-needed housing. But other issues were new, like the Trump administration’s purge of federal funding aimed at helping communities prepare for future flooding, which directly impacted projects in Chelsea and Everett.  
CommonWealth Beacon chronicled these storylines and selected its top five pieces from 2025. Here is your Gateway Cities recap.  
Maternal health care access in Leominster and North-Central Massachusetts  
Reports of women giving birth in cars, ambulances, emergency departments, or reaching a maternity unit just in time to deliver are a far cry from what is expected in a state that consistently ranks first in the country for its health care system.  
But in North-Central Massachusetts, pregnant women and families are living a reality that data, statistics, and health care rankings don’t always show.  
Two years after UMass Memorial Health Alliance-Clinton Hospital closed its maternity unit in Leominster, a CommonWealth Beacon deep-dive found that the region is struggling. The hospital was one of 11 in Massachusetts that have closed or filed to close their maternity unit services since 2014. The region has already faced multiple health care service closures in the last decade, and its emergency medical services have since been stretched thin. Women have had to travel longer distances to give birth.  
The fallout of the maternity unit closure paints a complicated picture in a state that technically doesn’t have maternity care deserts. But experts and advocates say recent losses and impending cuts to Medicaid will make it harder to access maternal health care in Massachusetts. Other Gateway Cities are facing the same dilemma, CommonWealth Beacon recently reported.  
Rehabbing vacant, blighted properties in Holyoke  
Dozens of old, blighted industrial buildings sit boarded up along Holyoke’s canal system and have been mostly vacant for decades. Some are close to collapsing, while others are covered in graffiti. Scattered across the center of downtown, the battered brick buildings are an untapped opportunity and serve as a constant reminder to city leaders of what could be. 
In recent decades, historic mills and old industrial buildings in Gateway Cities across the Commonwealth have been renovated and converted into much-needed housing. The projects are often a way for cities to preserve their historic charm while creating modern residential units in high demand. They also help to revitalize post-industrial era cities that suffered from the long-term decline of manufacturing. 
But while Eastern Massachusetts cities like Lowell and Lawrence have had success – with almost no former industrial buildings left to restore – cities farther west with weaker housing markets, which don’t enjoy the luxury of being connected to Greater Boston via the commuter rail, still struggle with an array of blighted properties that have yet to be developed. In these communities – like Holyoke, Springfield, and Fitchburg – the housing market doesn’t support rents that attract developers for these projects.  
Federal flood prevention funding in Chelsea and Everett  
When the axe fell on $882 million in federal funding aimed at helping communities prepare for future flooding, it came paired with a critique of the program’s very purpose.  
The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program “was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,” a FEMA spokesperson said in April. In dramatically re-orienting the US federal agency responsible for coordinating the country’s disaster relief efforts, the Trump administration cancelled all BRIC applications from Fiscal Years 2020-2023, imperiling states from New England to the Gulf Coast. 
Chelsea and Everett had money on the line – a $120 million flood resilience project for the Island End River, which generates dramatic flooding during serious coastal storms, that included a storm surge barrier, storm surge control facility, and wetland restoration set to begin construction in 2026.   
Massachusetts officials later estimated that some $90 million in funding and potential grants would be pulled, almost $50 million of which was dedicated to the Chelsea and Everett endeavor. Overnight, project managers overseeing resilient park and stormwater flooding projects, updating drinking water and watershed regulations, and preparing for the best ways to hold rising waters at bay rushed to triage.  
A tale of two middle schools in Holyoke  
After an October report published by the MassINC Policy Center (which is a part of MassINC, the nonprofit that publishes CommonWealth Beacon) detailed an inequitable state reimbursement process that disadvantages Gateway Cities and urban districts when it comes to school building projects, reporter Hallie Claflin travelled to Holyoke to tell the tale of two middle schools.  
As half of the school district’s middle school students filed into a newly built, state-of-the-art facility this year, the other half weren’t so lucky. Instead, those students filed into Clare P. Sullivan Middle School, a dated building constructed in 1961 that was originally built as an elementary school.  
In 2019, Holyoke set out to build two new middle schools to replace their dated facilities. After months of heated debate, a ballot measure to fund the project was voted down by the community, and the city was forced to continue with the construction of just one school – all they could afford.  
Some say the outcome is a testament to how limited fiscal capacity, an insufficient state funding formula, and local tax constraints work to prevent Gateway Cities like Holyoke from building equitable, modern school facilities. Many have also argued that racial bias has long prevented the city from investing in its public schools. 
New development clashes with affordable housing advocates in Lynn 
Thanks to the newly constructed Lynn Harbor Park, residents can now enjoy a view of Lynn Harbor that had been obstructed by garbage for decades.   
The waterfront is one of Lynn’s major attractions, and its development has been a key part of the North Shore city’s ongoing growth and economic revitalization plans. As the Harbor Park project neared completion this year, investors came flocking to the South Harbor. Several private housing projects are already underway.  
But affordable housing advocates in Lynn have raised concerns about the kind of development the park has attracted, comparing it to the technology-driven redevelopment of Boston’s wealthy Seaport District, which has resulted in a mostly high-income, white neighborhood on a previously underutilized waterfront.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/leominster-hospital-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 06:12:15.551186

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Fox Business host Dagen McDowell recently showed Americans that even Republican pundits will launch a war on Christmas if it means supporting AI’s creeping expansion into the economy.
“Everybody needs to get on board. I just don’t — You know what? Buy a fake [Christmas] tree!” shouted McDowell recently, defending the proposed destruction of a Maryland Christmas tree farm to make room for artificial intelligence data center transmission lines. 
But Fox media figures aside, do Americans actually want AI to become a major part of not just how we conduct business, but of how we live?
AI plans, straight from the horse’s mouth
People are usually right to give new technologies the benefit of the doubt and to be cautiously optimistic about where they will take us. 
This time it’s different. 
There is no benefit of the doubt for where AI is headed, because the “Tech Bros” who run AI companies have been honest and loud about what they’re planning:
“AI and robots will replace all jobs,” says xAI founder Elon Musk, attempting a utopian description of what life will look like when AI does everything for everyone. 
Color me skeptical that the wealthiest man on earth will advocate for an economically egalitarian society where everyone’s needs are met at the largess of billionaire-controlled AI systems, especially considering this particular billionaire runs an AI data center that’s poisoning a Memphis community.
As AI takes the helm of decision making, signs of perpetuating historic biases emerge

Musk established xAI’s “Colossus” data center in Memphis in 2024. The Southern Environmental Law Center took legal action against xAI in 2025 for operating 33 methane-powered gas turbines, despite only having a permit for 15. The facility belches nitrogen oxide and formaldehyde around the clock, blanketing primarily African American communities in a toxic haze and increasing Memphis’s smog by 30-60%.
Musk promised economic growth for Memphis, but do the handful of jobs created by the data center justify pollution and environmental racism, not to mention the facility’s massive electricity and water needs?
Tennessee is making a huge bet on AI
Each state is facing the question of how to approach AI, though the Trump administration is doing its best to stifle states’ rights with President Donald Trump’s recent executive order banning states from regulating AI. Tennessee lawmakers are not complaining, though, because the Volunteer State is all in, embracing AI with the kind of mad glee a dog has as it pounces on a porcupine. 
In November, Tennessee released its first Artificial Intelligence Advisory Council Action Plan, outlining how the state will integrate AI across government, education, and industry. The plan says nothing about curbing AI’s harmful effects on society or the environment, and it equivocates on how AI will affect Tennessee’s job market. 
Integrating AI throughout the state requires data centers, of which Tennessee now has at least 60, with the global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield identifying Nashville as an “emerging market” for data centers (Nashville has 27 data centers as of November). The surge of AI infrastructure into the state and the strain these facilities place on the grid is a big part of why Tennessee made the Top Ten list for states with the highest electricity bill increases in 2025.
Artificial intelligence is already changing how Americans work
Every time the Tech Bros promise to create jobs through AI development, they also brazenly admit this new technology will come at the cost of untold numbers of existing jobs.
“I think 30 to 40% of the tasks that people do in today’s economy could be done by AI in the not very distant future,” said OpenAI founder Sam Altman.
AI’s economic disruption isn’t just predicted, it’s already here. Amazon is automating its warehouses with AI-powered robots in places like Shreveport, Louisiana, and Stone Mountain, Georgia, slashing its human workforce and planning another half-million layoffs. UPS and Verizon have also executed significant layoffs, citing AI adoption. 
The changes are affecting young people the most. The U.S. is posting its highest college graduate unemployment rate in decades, with businesses closing their hiring portals and using AI to replace entry-level positions.
Tradespeople and working-class folks might think they’re safe, but AI is coming for them, too. A cohort of AI experts left the industry and collaborated on a paper predicting that humans will produce superhuman AI sometime between 2027 and 2030. 
Americans, anxious about AI’s role in the election, may not know its full scope, expert says

“Several large tech companies have explicitly set the goal of getting to [AI] super intelligence in the near future, which means an AI system that is better than the best humans at everything, while also being faster and cheaper,” says Daniel Kokotajlo, one of the paper’s co-authors and a former OpenAI employee.
Once AI development reaches a superhuman, super-intelligent stage, all human talent becomes obsolete immediately. Kokotajlo explains that at this stage, the AI begins training itself: advancing without human influence. The AI, not humans, begins designing and building robots that then go out into the world, build infrastructure and factories, and create more robots. In the blink of an eye, AI becomes its own quasi-species that can do everything humans can do, only better. 
If AI-powered robots in Shreveport and Stone Mountain are already running Amazon warehouses and physically moving packages around without the help of humans, it doesn’t take a stretch of the imagination to envision robots fixing your plumbing, re-roofing your house, cooking your food or teaching your kids math.
The economy is supposed to be about creating new opportunities, not giving up existing ones
From TV hosts arguing that we should have fewer choices in Christmas trees to tech oligarchs suggesting Americans shouldn’t have as much access to labor markets, it has been alarming to see formerly staunch defenders of capitalism suddenly argue that fewer opportunities are the correct way forward.
If AI expansion continues as it has been, publicly unaccountable and directed solely by a few tech billionaires and their bought-and-paid-for politicians and pundits, it will fundamentally alter how we conduct business, how we ascertain truth, and how we innovate.
Let us not so readily sacrifice the very avenues by which we express our humanity.

(Getty Images)Just days before Christmas, West Virginians should be focused on family, faith and the small joys that carry us through the coldest months of the year. Instead, far too many families across our state are staring down something that should never be part of the holiday season: the real possibility of losing their health care on Jan. 1.
With Congress leaving Washington for the holidays without extending the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced subsidies, the reality is now set. These critical affordability measures — lifelines for roughly 67,000 West Virginians — are slated to expire. And paired with the looming threat of Capito Care — or the “Big Beautiful Bill” — which makes the largest cuts to Medicaid in history and destabilizes our coverage system even further, West Virginia families are heading into the new year with more uncertainty than comfort.
The timing could not be more painful. Marketplace premiums are already rising sharply for many families in our state. Parents who found coverage they could finally afford last year are opening renewal notices that show premiums doubling or tripling. Older adults who rely on ACA plans until they reach Medicare age are being told their new premiums will rival a mortgage payment. Families who were budgeting for Christmas have been forced to pull from those same savings to keep their children insured.
And because Congress adjourned without renewing these subsidies, there is no longer time to prevent the immediate impact. The choices households are now facing are brutally simple: pay more than they can afford or go without coverage altogether.
This isn’t how a society should care for its people—especially not during the season that most deeply reflects compassion, generosity, and community.
Here in West Virginia, the consequences land harder than almost anywhere else. Our state has one of the highest percentages of residents relying on Medicaid. We have a large number of older adults, rural families, and workers in physically demanding jobs who depend on reliable, affordable health care to stay healthy and stay employed. Losing subsidies doesn’t just threaten individual families — it strains rural hospitals, weakens local economies and pulls stability out from under entire communities.
And yet, this moment also reflects something deeply true about our state: West Virginians know how to endure hardship, and they know how to fight for what’s right. In every major health care battle of the past decade, our neighbors — patients, caregivers, nurses, faith leaders and advocates — have stepped up to share their stories and stand together. That civic strength didn’t prevent this particular setback, but it will be essential in the weeks and months ahead.
The truth is that while Congress missed the window to prevent the immediate premium spikes, nothing about this outcome is inevitable going forward. Policy choices created this situation, and policy choices in the new year can fix it. There is still time — and still a responsibility — for federal leaders to restore the subsidies, protect Medicaid, and reject proposals like the “Big, Beautiful Bill” that would push even more West Virginians into crisis.
As we head into Christmas, my hope is that lawmakers remember the human impact behind every line of a bill or budget. Health care isn’t a partisan talking point. It’s the insulin a grandmother needs to survive. It’s the cancer screening that catches a problem early. It’s the coverage that lets parents take their child to the doctor without fear of bankruptcy.
At West Virginians for Affordable Health Care, we remain committed to lifting those stories and pushing for solutions that protect every family in our state. This season may bring anxiety for many, but it also brings clarity: West Virginians deserve better. They deserve health care that is reliable, affordable, and treated as the essential foundation it is.
Christmas reminds us to care for our neighbors. As we move into the new year, we must make sure our policies do the same.

Pennsylvania’s Department of Human Services is notifying households who might have lost benefits like medical or food assistance because of a problem with a state mail vendor that caused more than one million pieces of mail to be delayed by a month, officials said Friday.
The Harrisburg-area vendor did not send a month’s worth of state mail, officials have said.
Some families in the Pittsburgh area have been impacted by the problem.
Raymond Jiang is a 26-year-old Franklin Park resident with autism.
His mother Lei Zhang said her son Raymond’s Medicaid assistance was wrongly cut off because of the mail delay.
On December 12, she received a letter — dated Nov. 10 — saying her son’s Medicaid would be terminated Nov. 23. By the time she got the letter, it was too late to be able to keep the benefits on while she appealed the case.
The cutoff means not only has he lost the health insurance Medicaid provides, but also services and supports like a job coach, who helps him maintain his job as a dishwasher at a senior living center.
The ordeal has been very stressful, Zhang said. “I don’t know how he’s going to live without those supports,” she said.
About 1.7 million pieces of mail from the state’s Department of Human Services were impacted by the delay, which lasted from Nov. 3 to Dec. 3.
A spokesman for the department, which administers benefits like Medicaid and food stamps, said the agency’s staff “has worked around the clock” since it discovered the problem “to ensure clients receive communications as quickly as possible so they can respond to renewals and requests for information, and so DHS can make accurate eligibility determinations and avoid unnecessary disruptions.”
The department is working to notify impacted households, said Brandon Cwalina, a DHS spokesperson, and is also seeking guidance from federal officials since programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, have strict federal guidelines.
The department is extending deadlines for appeals “where possible under federal and state law,” Cwalina said.
It’s unclear exactly how many people have been impacted to the point of losing their benefits, said Maripat Pileggi, a supervising attorney at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, which assists low-income clients and has been helping some impacted by this issue.
People who receive assistance through SNAP or Medicaid must renew their benefits annually, and for SNAP, must also fill out semi-annual renewal paperwork every six months. People also must report changes in income or household size.
While the state has a website and an app where people are able to receive electronic notices, report some changes and upload documents, many people still receive paper notices through the U.S. mail about renewals.
“Mail is critically important for public benefits,” said Ann Sanders, an advocate with anti-hunger organization Just Harvest, which helps people apply for food assistance.
Sanders said the state will send text message reminders when people need to renew their benefits, but the reminders are often necessarily vague, she said, such as telling people to call the department.
“They won’t send you a text message that says your benefits were stopped,” Sanders said, partly because that’s exactly the kind of message sent by online scammers.
The state has since terminated the contract with the mail vendor, “and is exploring all legal options to protect Pennsylvanians, hold the vendor accountable and recover damages caused by the delay,” DHS’s Cwalina said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pennsylvania-Capitol-in-Harrisburg-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 05:57:46.551408

Medicaid, in particular, is a regular recipient of this criticism. Billions of government dollars are spent each year on the program, yet our nation continues to rank among the least healthy in the developed world.

This disconnect between health care spending and outcomes should make us pause. How much of our health care cost is truly about care, and how much is being consumed by the administrative machinery that manages care? It’s time to look beyond simply how much we spend and focus instead on how we spend and what we expect to see in return.
For decades, Medicaid has been viewed as a safety net: a system put in place to catch patients when they fall and provide them with coverage when they need it most. But safety nets can do more than catch; they can also propel. Public health programs should not only protect patients from medical crises but should propel them toward lasting health. However, achieving this requires one critical shift in the way we approach government-funded health care. We must move away from such a heavy focus on enrollment and begin to focus more deliberately on what comes after enrollment — patient engagement and education.
Health care coverage alone does not create wellness. Patients must be supported to engage in preventative care, and when they are, the results are undeniable. A flu shot costs less than the flu; a mammogram costs less than metastatic breast cancer; managing blood pressure costs less than a stroke. Preventive care isn’t just smart medicine, it’s compassionate care. It helps people stay healthy, catch problems early, and avoid needless suffering. And it’s also fiscally responsible: investing in prevention saves lives and reduces strain on families, communities, and the health care system as a whole. Given this, a patient’s enrollment in Medicaid should be viewed as the very beginning of their health care journey – not the outcome. Coverage allows the real work of launching a patient’s coverage into care, and care into health, to begin.
But Kentuckians need support to turn their coverage into action. That starts with knowing what’s already in their hands: every Medicaid member is assigned a primary care provider (it’s right there on the back of the insurance card), and their managed care organization (MCO), the company that runs their Medicaid plan, is just a phone call away. MCOs can help connect members to practical supports like transportation, care coordination and even incentives that make it easier to show up and stay engaged in care.
Still, coverage alone isn’t enough if care doesn’t fit real life. Health care has to work around jobs, kids, language barriers  and long commutes — not the other way around. That means extended hours after 5 p.m. and on weekends, urgent care options, clinics inside schools, translation services, mobile clinics, community health workers and the kind of wraparound supports that remove everyday obstacles.
Community Health Centers have been doing exactly this for almost 60 years, and Kentucky is fortunate to have 30 organizations operating nearly 600 sites statewide so high-quality, community-based care is never far from home. To help patients find these clinics and better navigate the health care system, the Kentucky Primary Care Association developed FindHealthNowKy.org to serve as a simple, user-friendly tool to help Kentuckians quickly connect with the services they need, where and when they need them.
The gap between coverage and care isn’t just clinical — it’s motivational. People can’t value what they don’t understand. When patients begin to see health care as an investment in their own future — and not just a bureaucratic necessity — they begin to engage. And that’s patient activation: turning passive coverage into active care.
This is the real return on investment — when we shift from paying for illness to investing in long-term health and wellness.
The worst-case scenario is a missed opportunity: someone remains covered but disengaged, sicker, unable to work, and still caught in the safety net. The best-case scenario is transformational: an activated patient who stabilizes, learns, grows, and propels themselves forward – managing chronic disease, preventing illness, gaining literacy, working more, and eventually graduating off public assistance altogether.
That’s the kind of ROI Kentucky should be proud to fund.
As Kentuckians know, in basketball, you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. The same holds true for health care. We can have the best programs, the most compassionate and skilled providers, and the most generous benefits. But if patients don’t engage in the opportunities available to them, we all lose.
Our challenge, and our opportunity, is to ensure that every Kentuckian understands that coverage isn’t the end of the story. It’s the start of a new one. When we invest in patient activation, we’re not just funding health care — we’re investing in human potential. And that’s how a safety net becomes a launchpad.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/241210MobileClinic408-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:57:46.551408

(Photo courtesy Dominion Energy)Dominion Energy’s massive Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, which is nearing completion, has been put on pause after the U.S. Department of Interior announced that “national security risks” were identified by the Department of Defense in classified reports.
According to a press release, the pause on offshore wind leases is intended to give the two departments time to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess ways to mitigate the potential risks from the projects. The nature of those risks was not disclosed to the media. 
Dominion officials said the pause will last 90 days while the assessments are conducted. The announcement came just one day after a ship left port to begin installing the first turbines beyond the two pilot turbines that were built in 2020.
In response, Dominion raised concerns that delays to the project could worsen strains on the electric grid as energy demand continues to grow from the naval base, residential customers and the rapidly expanding data center industry.
“Stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation’s most important war fighting, AI, and civilian assets. It will also lead to energy inflation and threaten thousands of jobs,” Dominion said in a statement.
The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is one of five major offshore wind projects now on hold. The $11 billion, 2.6 gigawatt project is designed to supply enough electricity to power more than  660,000 homes and is well into the construction phase, with the first turbines expected to be installed on their foundations in the coming weeks. The project includes a total of 176 turbines. 
Before the pause was announced, Dominion projected that the first power from the project would come online around the end of March.
“The project has been more than 10 years in the works, involved close coordination with the military, and is located 27 to 44 miles offshore, so far offshore it does not raise visual impact concerns. The project’s two pilot turbines have been operating for five years without causing any impacts to national security,” Dominion said.
This is not the first challenge the project has faced from the Trump Administration. In September, funding was pulled from several offshore wind projects and related port renovations. Those affected included the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port, also known as Fairwinds Landing, and the Portsmouth Marine Terminal Offshore Wind Development Project, both of which were already underway or had already spent the allocated funds.
The PMT project was intended to serve as part of the staging area for the CVOW project but ultimately was not impacted by the funding changes. U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, has been pushing back in recent months to make sure the project moves forward.
“I have been working with the Department of the Interior and Gov. Youngkin for months to safeguard Virginia’s Coastal Offshore Wind Project, and I am deeply disappointed by this news. This new directive will negatively affect Hampton Roads, thousands of workers, and the amount of energy that can be produced. It will also undermine military readiness,” Kiggans said.
U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats, and Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, released a joint statement calling the move by the Trump Administration political:
“Despite our senior roles on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, the administration has failed to share any new information that supports this sudden and sweeping move to halt all offshore wind development, including a project off the coast of Virginia that is already almost complete and operational,” they said. “That silence speaks volumes, especially given the president’s longstanding, well-documented opposition to offshore wind.”
An order from the Department of Interior said previous unclassified reports had identified risks with offshore wind projects, including radar interference caused by the movement of turbine blades.
“Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers,” Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement.
Dominion pushed back on the pause, arguing that completing the project is critical both to national security and to providing reliable power to the commonwealth.
“CVOW is essential for American national security and meeting Virginia’s dramatically growing energy needs, the fastest growth in America,” Dominion said. “This growth is driven by the need to provide reliable power to many of America’s most important war fighting installations, the world’s largest warship manufacturer, and the largest concentration of data centers on the planet as well as the leading edge of the AI revolution.”
Dominion customers are already paying for the project through their monthly electric bills after the State Corporation Commission approved the project in 2022. 
“Our customers are paying for the project after a careful review of project costs and benefits by Virginia state regulators in 2022. These same state regulators, along with numerous federal agencies, oversee our cyber and physical security program, which is among the strongest in the energy industry,” Dominion said.
The Office of Governor Glenn Youngkin could not immediately be reached for comment.

Advocates say expanding insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization would help more Virginians build families without facing overwhelming financial barriers. (Photo by Thanasis Zovoilis/Getty Images)Forty-four years ago on Dec. 28, my mother gave birth to me, the first baby in the U.S. conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF). I exist because of science, and most importantly, because my parents had access to this groundbreaking new healthcare in Virginia. 
The commonwealth of Virginia, the state where my parents became the first in the nation to give birth to an IVF baby, has a chance to make the procedure far more accessible to many Virginians by mandating that this safe and effective medical treatment be covered by insurance. 
The state that led with the science to help create families can now once again become a national leader in lowering the financial barrier to accessing it.  
It wasn’t that long ago that IVF was a brand-new medical technology regarded as experimental. 
In 1981, my parents, struggling with infertility, left our home in Massachusetts to receive IVF treatment in Virginia from Drs. Howard and Georgeanna Jones, who pioneered it, because the procedure was outlawed in our home state. Just over four decades ago, IVF was new, misunderstood and heavily restricted. 
Thankfully, today, IVF is accepted as standard care for infertility, and the vast majority of  Americans — a reported 86% — support access to this treatment. While to call IVF a miracle would be to shortchange the medical geniuses behind the treatment, each of the tens of thousands of IVF babies born in the U.S. yearly are a personal miracle to people struggling with the devastation of infertility. 
Yet ironically, Virginia, the birthplace of IVF, today lags behind many other states in mandating insurance coverage for the procedure, putting it out of reach for far too many. 
Without insurance coverage, one round of IVF can cost from $12,000 to $25,000. Most people need to undergo several rounds before sustaining a viable pregnancy — adding a crushing financial burden to the emotional angst and physical ordeal of fertility care. 
We know a very high number of couples who embark on IVF stop their treatment because of the cost — and we don’t even know how many people never even begin it because of the burden of out-of-pocket expenses.
In the DMV, both Maryland and Washington, D.C. residents have greater access to IVF than the one in six Virginians facing infertility. 
Other states have taken their commitment to helping infertile couples seriously. Massachusetts, which once barred my parents from IVF, today offers one of the strongest and most comprehensive IVF coverage mandates in the country. 
Fortunately, the Virginia General Assembly returns in January with a meaningful opportunity to expand access to family building. 
Last year, Democratic Del. Dan Helmer of Fairfax passed a transformative bill to direct Virginia’s Health Insurance Reform Commission to include IVF and infertility treatment in Virginians health plans. Helmer’s bill means that for millions of Virginians, the decision to start a family isn’t limited by their ability to afford care.
IVF is the most pro-family medical care we have. It allows patients a chance at parenthood. It is also modern health care critical to addressing the medical condition of infertility which, like any other medical condition, should be covered by insurance to diagnose and treat. 
Without mandated insurance coverage, Virginians facing infertility face impossible choices. But having a baby shouldn’t be a privilege only for those with resources or employers that cover fertility care. It’s a right that should belong to all Virginians. 
As living proof of what can happen when people have access to science, I urge Virginia legislators to seize this moment and help families across the commonwealth. Forty-four years ago, Virginia made my birth possible by removing the barrier to new medical care. Today, its leaders can remove the cost barrier to IVF and give the next generation the same chance that was given to my parents. 
Elizabeth Carr is the first person born in the United States through in vitro fertilization and a leading advocate for fertility rights and patient-centered care. She speaks nationally and internationally on access to infertility treatment and currently works at Genomic Prediction, a company that provides genetic testing for embryos used in IVF.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Several Eastern Shore counties have withdrawn from an appeal of Maryland’s recertification for the Conowingo Dam, a challenge that the state feared could put a $340 million settlement with Constellation, the dam’s owner, in jeopardy.
But the county that hosts the dam, Cecil, is moving forward with the complaint, which argues that counties on the Shore were improperly excluded from the recertification process. Tbe appeal also bemoans the fact that the agreement itself does not guarantee that harmful sediment in the dam’s overflowing reservoir will be drained out.
The deal resolved years of legal wrangling between the dam owner and the state, pluscwaterkeeper groups that intervened in the litigation. In exchange for recertification — which is needed for Constellation to get a 50-year license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to keep operating the hydropower plant at the dam — Maryland is set to receive $340 million from Constellation for environmental projects at the site. If all goes according to plan for the state, the federal license will incorporate Maryland’s conditions.
Several counties on the Shore had joined the appeal of the certification filed by an attorney for the Clean Chesapeake Coalition. But Maryland Department of the Environment officials lobbied counties to rescind their complaint, arguing that it could muddy the waters as the dam tries to get its new FERC license.
Officials also worried that an anticipated policy change from the Trump administration, undermining states’ recertification authority, could make matters worse.
After those conversations, Dorchester and Kent counties opted to abandon the administrative appeal, which MDE will ultimately rule on. Queen Anne’s has also withdrawn, according to the state and the Coalition, but that county did not respond to a request for comment.

“They [MDE] explained to us more about how a delay in this agreement going through could hamper some of the actions they want to do to clean up the bay,” said Dorchester County Council Presdent Lenny Pfeffer. “We’d rather see some cleanup than no cleanup.”
Cecil County, though, is holding pat, said county spokesperson Robert Royster.
In a statement earlier this month, Royster expressed concern that county leaders didn’t play a role in the settlement, and said that the county’s water intakes south of the dam, including in Perryville, Port Deposit and Havre de Grace, “continue to experience significant impacts from sediment and debris trapped behind the Conowingo Dam.”
Dorchester County officials also learned after filing the administrative appeal that “it wouldn’t be possible to change the negotiations between Constellation and the state,” because they occurred as part of the litigation, Pfeffer said.
“MDE has told us that they will be giving us a seat at the table going forward,” Pfeffer said.
Adam Ortiz, deputy secretary at the Department of the Environment, said the state has “committed to the parties that dropped the challenge that they can have an advisory role in the implementation of the projects.”
“We’ve had good conversations in recent weeks, and when good people talk, good things happen. So, we’re really glad that these counties have stepped back,” Ortiz said.
After nearly a decade of back-and-forth, state officials are eager to “get out of the courts and get to work,” Ortiz said.
Pfeffer said that his county council does not plan to renege on a $5,000 commitment to the attorney who filed the complaint, Charles “Chip” MacLeod. The money came from the county’s contingency funds, Pfeffer said.
Kent County also planned to send the same sum, said Ronald Fithian, president of the board of commissioners. But it’s unclear whether the funds were dispatched before the county reversed course, Fithian said.
Fithian said that the state promised to convene a meeting in January to discuss the Conowingo settlement with the counties — if they dropped the appeal.
“We just figured it might be better to work with them and go to this meeting,” Fithian said, “and see if we could recommend some ways that would make the bay a healthier place.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HEADSHOT-198-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:12:09.816046

(Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)The second half of New Hampshire’s biennial legislative session starts on Jan. 7. As the state aims to fulfill its goal of increasing child care capacity and combating workforce shortage struggles, here’s a look at some of the filed bills relating to early care and education. 
House Bill 1566, Senate Bill 483: An act making a contingent appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services for recruitment and benefit grants for child care employees. 
What these bills aim to do: After the federal government said the state could not use Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds for child care employers, $15 million is in limbo despite it being allocated in the state’s budget earlier this year. HB 1566 and SB 438 propose allocating $15 million in a “non-lapsing general fund appropriation” for the next fiscal year to aid child care employers in recruiting and retaining employees. So far, this is the only child care-related bill filed in both the House and the Senate, with very few differences in language. 
What legislators said: Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, a Concord Democrat and primary sponsor of the bill in the House, said failure to fund the $15 million appropriation would be “sliding backwards” instead of moving forward. 
“The real issue that we are having in New Hampshire with our child care community is that we do not have a workforce, and we’re trying to hang on,” she said. “There is a workforce shortage, but child care is something that really benefits businesses, government, families; it’s something that really benefits everyone.” 
The hearing for SB 483 will be held on Jan. 14 at 1:30 p.m. at the State House. 
House Bill 1515: An act repealing the child care grant program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
What the bill aims to do: If passed, HB 1515 will repeal the $15 million appropriation in House Bill 2 to the Department of Health and Human Services to provide recruitment, retention, and benefit grants to child care employers.
What one bill sponsor said: Bill sponsor Rep. Len Turcotte, a Barrington Republican, said, “the language [of House Bill 2] also details what the money could be used for, mostly for payments to child care centers and their employees. I do not believe we, as taxpayers, should be on the hook for what the ‘backers’ proposed.” 
House Bill 1433: An act creating a child care tax credit for qualifying businesses.
What the bill aims to do: HB 1433 proposes creating a tax credit program that would incentivize businesses to create or expand child care programs. If passed, businesses would receive a tax credit if they increase the number of seats in a child care program by 12 or more, either directly or through a third party, after Jan. 1, 2027. 
The bill states: “The general court finds that: The availability of reliable child care is critical for parents to remain in the work force, and that there is a shortage of child care available to working parents in New Hampshire. It is in the interest of this state to stimulate the creation and expansion of child care programs by providing an incentive to businesses in the form of a tax credit.” 
Expenditures eligible for the tax credit include money spent on the creation or renovation of a child care facility and on operational expenditures — employee compensation, training, utilities, and rent — during the first two years of a new facility. Businesses can claim a credit equal to 50% of their total expenditures applicable to the Business Profits Tax and Business Enterprise Tax. 
What Gov. Kelly Ayotte said: During a forum on investing in child care on Oct. 30, Ayotte said she was “very mindful” of the bill’s ability to motivate the private sector into colocating child care. 
“So if there’s a way that we can incentivize the private sector, say ‘this is an investment area where you invest,’ we’re going to provide some added incentive for [businesses] to do that, because that makes it a lot easier for people,” she said. “It makes it easier for employers, because they have child care right there, they can attract good employees, and it’s a win-win for both sides of the aisle.” 
Senate Bill 614: An act establishing pooled risk management programs for the benefit of child care centers and foster family homes. 
What the bill aims to do: If passed, the bill would establish a pooled risk management program for child care centers and foster family homes, specifically for liability insurance. A risk pool is a collective agreement in which multiple businesses share and manage their risks, maintain financial stability together, and provide support to one another, rather than buying insurance from an agency. 
The bill states that child care centers and foster care homes are “presently burdened” with trying to secure insurance and that it is “essential to the proper functioning of child care centers and the foster care system.” Liability insurance is a significant expense for child care providers and has become increasingly difficult to obtain due to the high risk and limited availability of coverage.
A risk pool may provide coverage for workers’ compensation, general, professional, or employer liability; medical payments; unemployment compensation; property damage; transportation and/or theft. The bill requires the state to “ensure standards are met” in establishing the pool, and the pool will not be subject to insurance regulation or taxation. 
What one bill sponsor said: “Liability insurance for day cares is very expensive,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, a Bedford Republican. “There aren’t many insurance companies offering that specialty liability coverage, and the market is described as a hard market by the insurance department,” she stated. “This is a practical, fiscally responsible step that strengthens the foundation of care for New Hampshire’s children.”
House Bill 1195: An act relative to municipal zoning requirements for child day care providers.
What the bill aims to do: Currently, some towns have local zoning ordiances that prevent family-based care in residential areas and center-based care in commercial areas. The zoning barriers do not always align with state law and can make it difficult for providers to open new child care programs. 
HB 1195 would ensure that in residential areas, family care providers are allowed by right to use their homes as a child care facility as long as they comply with state licensing rules and requirements. It would also require towns to allow child care centers in commercially zoned areas.
What bill sponsor, Rep. David Page, said: Page, a Conway Democrat, said, “We know that with the dire shortage of available slots, parents are often commuting long distances to the nearest center where they can find care and then having to double back to their place of employment. More child care near jobs makes sense for families and for employers. It’s a win-win.”
Senate Bill 645: An act relative to income eligibility for New Hampshire child care scholarship program and allocating certain revenue to fund the program. 
What the bill aims to do: If passed, SB 645 will increase income eligibility for New Hampshire’s Child Care Scholarship Program from the current 85% of the state median income to 95%. Additionally, it proposes reallocating 2% of tax revenue generated from alcohol and tobacco to the Department of Health and Human Services to help administer the program. 
Senate Bill 608: An act relative to family caregiver support in certain programs and child care support for kinship caregivers.
What the bill aims to do: SB 608 proposes to amend the eligibility requirements for the Child Care Scholarship Program and child care training costs, and to expand the services allowed under Medicaid waiver programs. 
Eligibility currently requires a parent, grandparent, or legal guardian to be working, applying to work, or in a training program. If passed, the bill will change the work requirements of the Child Care Scholarship Program to allow retired grandparents who are the legal guardians or primary caretakers of their grandchildren to be eligible for the program. SB 608 also proposes changes that would require the Department of Health and Human Services to offer evidence-based trauma-informed trainings at no cost to child care providers. Currently, trauma-informed trainings are not legally mandated to be evidence-based and can be at the expense of the provider. 
Additionally, the bill directs Health and Human Services to seek approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to expand family support services as an allowance to the Acquired Brain Disorder, Choices for Independence, and Home and Community Based Services waiver programs. 
House Bill 1720: An act relative to notice to child day care providers of child care scholarships.
What this bill aims to do: The bill proposes new measures to improve communication between the Department of Health and Human Services and child care providers using the Child Care Scholarship Program. It requires that if a licensed child care program is named on a scholarship application (as is sometimes the case because applicants must be connected to a provider before or during the application process), the provider must be electronically notified within three business days. 
A notice would include the child’s name, anticipated start date, and a statement that the application is pending eligibility determination. Health and Human Services would also be required to notify providers within three business days whether a child is approved, denied, or has withdrawn their application.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ecebillsstatehouse-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:12:09.816046

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Establishing a comprehensive data privacy law. Using tax credits to offset energy costs. Returning sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations. Expanding the state’s infrastructure to track and test rape kits. 
These are among the nearly 400 proposals that the Maine Legislature is poised to revisit when lawmakers reconvene in January. The state Legislature operates on a two-year cycle, often pushing off the most debated bills into the second year. 
Or, in the case of digital privacy, some policy debates can span multiple Legislatures. 
Maine is now in its 132nd Legislature but lawmakers first proposed this type of law during the 131st, with two competing plans failing after outsized lobbying efforts. Those plans returned in 2025, with the version that would make regulations in Maine among the strictest in the country the top lobbied bill of the year. But agreement has still not been reached, so debate will resume when lawmakers reconvene. 
Some of the bills carried over received initial votes but the final outcome is still undetermined. The data privacy bill favored by the Judiciary Committee reached the floor, but lawmakers decided not to vote on it and instead to push off a decision until next session. (Read about why here.) 
Meanwhile, legislative committees decided to carry over other bills that they didn’t finish work on,sometimes even before holding public hearings, which was the case for the sweeping tribal sovereignty bill. 
Not included in the table above, lawmakers also opted to carry over all of the bills that were left on what are referred to as the appropriations and study tables when the Legislature adjourned, as well as any bills left in the possession of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee.
The appropriations committee sets the budget, and if a bill is not accounted for in the budget, it’s placed on the appropriations table, where lawmakers on this committee decide whether to fund it with remaining funds after the budget is set. 
Two of the bills that lawmakers didn’t fund had to do with sexual assault forensic examination kits, commonly called rape kits. One would establish a statewide tracking system for such kits, and the other would require an inventory be taken of existing kits in the possession of law enforcement. These kits preserve evidence left behind during an assault through a forensic medical examination that survivors can choose to undergo. DNA evidence from these kits can then be used to solve and prevent crimes.
As the Legislature enters the second year of its two-year cycle, any bills left on the table upon final adjournment will die. During the 131st Legislature, less than 10% of bills that were placed on the table at some point ultimately became law. 
Bills end up on the study table if they involve studies. The Legislative Council, which is made up of the ten elected members of leadership, manages this table and decides which bills get legislative staff to help conduct the research.
Last session, the council did not approve studies on a range of issues — such as an equitable energy transition for Maine’s workforce and the feasibility of establishing a dedicated state family court — which can be considered again next session. (More on those proposals here.)
Any bills that get funded off of the appropriations table or staffed from the study table still need the approval of Gov. Janet Mills, who is entering the final year of her two-term tenure. 
During the first regular session, Mills postponed her decision on 61 bills that the Legislature had approved. 
This legislation included proposals to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following the state’s largest toxic foam spill in Brunswick.
Noting the high number of bills passed at the end of session, Mills said she needed more time to thoroughly review these proposals and their implications. When the next session begins on Jan. 7, Mills will have three days to either veto the legislation or allow it to become law without her signature. 
She’s already announced her intention to allow at least two to become law: one bill to restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement and another that will require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Stewart_12_4_JNeuger-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:12:09.816046

(Official photos.)It now seems nearly inevitable that health insurance costs will spike at the end of the month for nearly 600,000 Ohioans and 23 million Americans. An Ohio family doctor and colleagues in other states are blasting Republicans in Congress for not doing more to stop it.
Subsidies for health care purchased on exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire Jan. 1, causing health expenses to more than double for millions.
“Without the ACA tax credits, they just can’t make health care work in their budget. So they’ll put off screenings… they won’t just split pills, they won’t take them at all,” said Catherine Romanos, a Columbus family doctor. 
She was speaking during a virtual press conference last week sponsored by the Committee to Protect Health Care, a nonprofit advocacy group of 36,000 doctors that says it doesn’t accept funding from for-profit health care corporations. 
“I don’t blame them,” Romanos said of her patients. “Everything is expensive — rent, child care, groceries. Something has to give. I blame the leaders in Washington. They had an opportunity to help out patients like the ones I see every day. They had an opportunity to ensure that their constituents would continue seeing the doctor… but they chose not to.”
The office of Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno attacked Romanos on political grounds and said he was working on a compromise extension of the subsidies. The office of Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted did not respond to a request for comment.
Despite President Donald Trump’s promises to quickly stop inflation, it continues nearly a year into his second term. 
Meanwhile, when adjusted for inflation, median annual income actually dropped from about $71,000 in 2019 to $67,873 four years later, according to the Ohio Housing Finance Agency.
Even so, Husted and Moreno this summer voted for Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
It extended Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, at a cost of $4 trillion over 10 years, with $1 trillion of that benefit flowing to the richest 1% of Americans. It will add an estimated $3.4 trillion to the deficit.
At the same time, it cuts more than $1 trillion in medical and food assistance to low-income Americans over the same period.
Even though they extended the tax cuts, congressional Republicans opted not to extend 2021 subsidies to people buying health insurance on the ACA exchanges. 
The struggle over the subsidies was at the center of a 43-day government shutdown that ended Nov. 12.
Husted said he didn’t want to put the $350 billion cost to extend them 10 years “on the national credit card for a program that we know is dysfunctional.”
Those subsidies average about $700 a year, but they can be as high as $20,000 for some. They’re credited with helping to bring the rate of uninsured Americans to an all-time low. 
Republicans have thus far thwarted Democratic attempts to renew the subsidies, but huge majorities of Americans support doing so. 
Vulnerable Republicans in Congress have defied their leaders and joined an effort to force a vote on extension sometime in January. 
Moreno has been participating in bipartisan talks about a compromise. And he and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, in December made a proposal for a two-year extension that didn’t go anywhere.
If an agreement is struck in January, it can be made retroactive. But by then, the damage will already be piling up.
The health-analysis nonprofit KFF estimates that average premiums for 23 million Americans will more than double in the absence of the subsidies. And nearly 5 million are expected to drop coverage and join the ranks of uninsured.
The time to have extended the subsidies was months ago, before the government shutdown, Rob Davidson said. 
He’s an emergency doctor in western Michigan who spoke during the Committee to Protect Health Care press conference. 
“This didn’t sneak up on us,” he said. “Democrats and health care advocates have been calling for months — pretty much all year — for Congress to take action and extend the ACA tax credits but congressional Republicans have chosen to do nothing.” 
He said expiration of the subsidies would hurt everybody. 
Emergency doctors in Ohio have said that just because people lose insurance, that doesn’t mean they’ll stop getting sick. And emergency departments have to treat them regardless of their ability to pay. 
That will sap hospital budgets and increase wait times and compromise care for all, they said.
“This isn’t just a crisis for Americans who get their health care through the ACA,” Davidson said. “When millions of Americans can no longer afford their plans, and when millions more lose their health care because of Republican cuts to Medicaid, hospitals operating on thin margins will be forced to close.”
Romanos, the Columbus family doctor, said patients themselves will become sicker if skyrocketing premiums make them poorer. 
The vast majority of those receiving subsidies already are in the bottom half of the income distribution. 
About 70% of the people using the ACA exchanges make 250% or less of federal poverty guidelines. 
For a family of four, that’s $80,375 a year,or  a third less than the median income for a family of that size in Ohio.
Romanos said patients will ration their own care if they think they can’t afford it.
“Maybe they don’t get all the lab tests that I want, or they don’t take all the medicine I prescribe,” she said. “Some just can’t afford the health care I recommend.”
She said it all could have been prevented months ago.
“Here in Ohio, our senators, Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, voted against helping Ohioans afford health insurance,” Romanos said. 
“They voted to let premiums skyrocket. Earlier this year, senators Moreno and Husted voted to give tax breaks to billionaires, but I guess health care for working families is just too expensive. What a slap in the face for my patients. Ohioans deserve leaders who look out for them, not billionaires like Donald Trump, who mocks affordability.”
Reagan McCarthy, Moreno’s communications director, responded with a statement focused on politics instead of the ACA subsidies.
“Catherine Romanos is progressive activist and longtime Democrat donor who supported (former Democratic Vice President) Kamala Harris (and former Democratic Ohio Sen.) Sherrod Brown,” McCarthy said in an email. 
“Romanos even served as a surrogate for the Ohio Democrat(ic) Party and falsely attacked Senator Moreno repeatedly. Someone who ‘fell in love with the idea of being an abortion provider’ is hardly an objective source for this garbage ‘journalism.’ Once again, the Ohio Capital Journal chooses to shamelessly prop up Ohio Democrats rather than report the facts.”
Husted’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
After the government shutdown ended in November, Husted proposed a “freeze” that would have extended the subsidies while cutting benefits, the number of people who could get them, or both.
Makunda Abdul-Mbacke is an OB-GYN in Rockingham County, a rural area in the North Carolina Piedmont. 
She said taking away the ACA subsidies and slashing Medicaid spending will drive many already-struggling rural hospitals out of business. 
She said that will force struggling patients to drive farther for preventative care such as pap smears and mammograms.
“Without a mammogram, we will not be able to pick up breast cancer when it’s early,” Abdul-Mbacke said. 
“We will pick it up when it’s stage three or stage four and that means that someone is losing their mother. Someone is losing their aunt or their sister or their daughter. It just appears as though the Republicans we elected just don’t care about those things as long it’s not their family.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Twenty-year-old Mikayla Foreman knows her experience is meaningful. Dealing with homelessness since 18 and currently living in a shelter, Foreman has managed to continue her academic journey, studying for exams this month in hopes of attaining a nursing degree.
But Foreman believes there were intervention points that could’ve prevented her from experiencing homelessness in the first place.
“If someone in school had understood what I was going through, things could’ve been very different,” she said in an interview with Stateline.
As more cities impose bans, fines or jail time for adults living on the streets, young people who have been homeless say they face unique problems that could have been addressed earlier. Through more than 400 interviews and survey responses, young people across the country recently told researchers how earlier guidance and intervention might have made a difference for them. The research suggests the country is missing its biggest opportunity to prevent youth homelessness — by intervening well before a young person reaches a shelter and years before they are chronically homeless.
The report, from Covenant House and the University of California, Berkeley, finds that the pathways into youth homelessness are different from those of adults experiencing temporary or chronic homelessness. A young person coming out to their family, or becoming pregnant, or experiencing untreated trauma can create conflicts that push them into homelessness. A lot of that doesn’t show up in current data.











If someone in school had understood what I was going through, things could’ve been very different.


– Mikayla Foreman, 20



The survey responses offer the nation’s schools and social services agencies the chance to get ahead of youth homelessness, researchers say, not only by intervening earlier, but also by pinpointing and responding to the diversity of needs among teenagers and young adults who might be close to losing their housing.
Advocates say there are multiple intervention points — in school, in child welfare organizations and inside family dynamics — where the worst outcomes can be avoided. States such as California, Florida, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington have explored some of those intervention points in policies that range from guaranteed income pilot programs to youth-specific rental assistance and campus housing protections.
Hawaii has made its youth drop-in and crisis-diversion program permanent, and Oregon and Washington have expanded rental assistance and education-centered supports for vulnerable youth. Florida now requires colleges to prioritize housing for homeless and foster students.
“With young people, we have opportunities to intervene much further upstream — in schools, in families, in child welfare — before anyone has to spend a single night on the streets. That’s simply not the case with older adults,” said David Howard, former senior vice president for Covenant House and a co-author of the new research, in an interview with Stateline.
“Even at 18, 20 or 24 [years old], young people are still developing,” Howard said. “Their vulnerabilities look very different from middle-aged adults, and the support systems they need are different too.”
One of the key points of intervention for potentially homeless youth is school. Public schools across the country have increasingly reported more homeless students since the COVID-19 pandemic.
And homelessness has many various regional factors outside of individual circumstances, such as climate-driven homelessness. More than 5,100 students in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina became homeless as a result of hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024.
With homelessness rising, new federal rules could benefit states that take tougher approaches

“Homelessness is multifaceted and lots of us slip through the cracks because the system isn’t designed for our reality,” said Foreman, a former Covenant House resident who helped conduct the new research.
Foreman’s insights and lived experience were included in the study, which showed that youth homelessness rarely begins with an eviction or job loss — frequent causes of homelessness among adults.
The top three reasons that young people experience homelessness for the first time, according to respondents, were being kicked out of their family homes, running away, and leaving an unsafe living situation such as one affected by domestic violence. Other instigators included being unable to afford housing, aging out of foster care, being kicked out of or running away from foster care, and moving away from gang violence.
However, respondents also had suggestions for ways government, schools and the community could help or prevent youth homelessness. They suggested youth-specific housing options, identifying and helping at-risk youth in health care settings, providing direct cash assistance and offering conflict resolution support within families.
Among the most common suggestions was to offer services that create long-lasting connections for young people.
“Strong relationships with non-parental adults, including mentors, teachers, service providers, and elders, were identified as especially important when family connections were strained or absent,” the report said.
Couch, car or curb: Defining which young person is ‘homeless’ affects aid state by state

The surveys and interviews also demonstrated that young people want mental health care tailored to their personal experience, said Benjamin Parry, a lead researcher on the report, speaking during a September webinar hosted by Point Source Youth, a nonprofit that works to end youth homelessness.
The research breaks out responses from a few specific groups — Indigenous, Latino, immigrant, LGBTQ+ people of color and pregnant or parenting youth — to understand their distinct needs, said Parry, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley’s School of Public Health. “There’s so much nuance and specificity within these different groups.”
Indigenous youth, for example, often are dealing with the effects of intergenerational trauma and alcoholism that have been projected onto them, Parry said. Those young people have far different needs than pregnant or parenting youth, he noted.
“They are like, ‘I don’t know where my next paycheck’s going to come from, I don’t know how to put food in my baby’s stomach, I don’t have a support network or someone to go to for this advice,’” he said. “That specificity is exactly why we need to understand this better and do better to tailor our approaches and responses.”

Kennedy's departure to run for lieutenant governor will bring about a six-way race to replace him in the senate. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA major figure in the Georgia Senate is out, and six candidates are hoping to earn their way in.
Former state Sen. John Kennedy, a Macon Republican who served as president pro tempore, the Senate’s second-in-command, stepped down this month to focus on a run for lieutenant governor.
Kennedy had represented his district, which includes Crawford, Monroe, Peach and Upson counties as well as parts of Bibb and Houston counties, since 2014. Five Republicans and one Democrat have signed up to face off to replace him, including a former GOP state representative, a recent small town mayor and an ex-Fort Valley city council member.
The winner will only serve for part of this year’s legislative session – the election is set for Jan. 20 with a runoff scheduled for Feb. 17, while lawmakers will gavel in Jan. 12 and likely wrap up around late March or early April. All members of the state Legislature will be up for re-election next November.
Here’s a look at the candidates hoping to become Georgia’s newest state senator, listed in alphabetical order.

Eugene Allison
Allison, a Republican and retired factory worker from Thomaston, is an outspoken proponent of strengthening domestic violence laws. He has spoken at City Council meetings on the topic and can sometimes be seen standing on the street holding signs criticizing officials for not doing enough to stop domestic violence.
Allison said he became interested in advocacy after learning that a loved one experienced domestic violence.
If elected, Allison said his top priority will be to increase penalties for domestic violence and related crimes like stalking.
“I’ve been talking to different victims, not just in District 18, but throughout Georgia, and their stories are about the same,” he said. “They got anger management classes, or they didn’t get locked up, police would only give them a warning instead of making the arrest, so that’s why domestic violence is a priority.”
He said he also wants to prioritize increasing school safety, including by hiring more law enforcement and installing metal detectors.
LeMario Brown

The sole Democrat in the race is LeMario Brown, a small business owner and farmer in Peach County who previously served on the Fort Valley City Council.
In a phone call, Brown said his priorities if elected will center around affordability.
“It’s about taking care of real people and real issues,” he said. “We’re talking about just common sense stuff, being able to feed your family, being able to be sustainable with this health care system we have now that I feel like (the Trump) administration put us in a bad spot in. That’s the story out here all over this district and all over the state of Georgia, a lot of rural hospitals are closing, a lot of people, they’re losing insurance because their premiums are going to be skyrocketing.”
Winning in the district as a Democrat will be a tough hill to climb. Kennedy won nearly two thirds of the vote in 2022, the last time he faced a Democratic challenger.
But, buoyed by wins and overperformances in recent elections, state Democratic leaders are putting their weight behind Brown. Figures including Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones and Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey have visited the district to stump for Brown.
Lauren Daniel

Daniel, a Republican from Locust Grove, previously served in the state House, where she sat on committees including education and transportation. Daniel won her seat in 2022 and was defeated in the 2024 Republican primary by state Rep. Noelle Kahaian.
In an email, Daniel said she’s running on her conservative bona fides and her record in the House.
“I’m running because I believe Middle Georgia deserves a senator with conviction and experience to defend our conservative values from the radical left and end the California creep that’s coming into the state of Georgia,” she said. “I’m the best person for the job because I am the only one in this race who has stood with President Trump, I’ve already served in our legislature, and I have a proven record of being unapologetically conservative, while also being able to be effective.”
Among her top priorities if elected, Daniel listed reining in property taxes, improving the education system and boosting public safety.
Steven McNeel

McNeel, a Republican attorney from Bibb County, did not respond to requests for comment.
In campaign statements, McNeel pledged to uphold conservative values if elected, including by cutting taxes, promoting school vouchers and supporting the federal government’s efforts to deport undocumented migrants.
“As your State Senator, I will work diligently to protect our values, stand up for our farmers, and support policies that attract good jobs to Middle Georgia.”
Nathan Warnock

Warnock, a Republican from Bibb County, is a retiree whose career has included serving 15 years in the U.S. Army as well as working in the mortgage and insurance fields.
Warnock said in a phone call that he had been looking for ways to get involved in the community during his retirement, and the opening in the Senate seemed like a sign from above.
“I’ve always wanted to serve, and there’s just some things that I’d like to get done,” he said. “I’d like to see senior citizens be exempt from property taxes and from school taxes. I would like to have a bill passed that if any facility is caught selling alcohol or tobacco to minors, that they lose their license and ability to sell alcohol or tobacco for a minimum of five years, maximum of 10 years, and that that location, even if sold or transferred ownership, is not allowed to be able to sell alcohol or tobacco for that length of time.”
Warnock said he is not accepting campaign donations from anyone for the race so he won’t be beholden to anybody.
“If you’re the kind of person that wants to try to always root for the underdog, I’m your man,” he said. “This is a David and Goliath moment, and I really feel like this is God saying to do this.”
Eric Wilson

Republican Eric Wilson served as mayor of the city of Forsyth since 2016 before resigning to run for Kennedy’s seat. Before serving as mayor, Wilson was a member of the city council, and he is a co-founder and owner of a medical transportation company.
In a phone call, Wilson said those experiences help make him the best candidate for the job.
“I believe I’m the right person for the job because I’m uniquely qualified,” he said. “I have experience for 25 years as a business owner, meeting the payroll and taking care of my employees and taking care of our customers, and also I’ve spent the last 16 years in local government in a small town, serving as mayor for the last 10 years, and I think those experiences combined make me qualified to serve the citizens of District 18.”
Wilson said his top priorities if elected will include lowering costs with a focus on reducing property taxes and building on this year’s tort law legislation to lower insurance costs.

A group of college students braved the frigid New England weather on Dec. 13, 2025, to attend a late afternoon review session at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Eleven of those students were struck by gunfire when a shooter entered the lecture hall. Two didn’t survive.
Shortly after, a petition circulated calling for better security for Brown students, including ID-card entry to campus buildings and improved surveillance cameras. As often happens in the aftermath of tragedy, the conversation turned to lessons for the future, especially in terms of school security.
There has been rapid growth of the nation’s now US$4 billion school security industry. Schools have many options, from traditional metal detectors and cameras to gunshot detection systems and weaponized drones. There are also purveyors of artificial-intelligence-assisted surveillance systems that promise prevention: The gun will be detected before any shots are fired, and the shooting will never happen.
They appeal to institutions struggling to protect their communities, and are marketed aggressively as the future of school shooting prevention.
I’m a criminologist who studies mass shootings and school violence. In my research, I’ve found that there’s a lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of these technological interventions.
 Grasping for a solution

Implementation has not lagged. A survey from Campus Safety Magazine found that about 24% of K-12 schools report video-assisted weapons detection systems, and 14% use gunshot detection systems, like ShotSpotter.
Gunshot detection uses acoustic sensors placed within an area to detect gunfire and alert police. Research has shown that gunshot detection may help police respond faster to gun crimes, but it has little to no role in preventing gun violence.
Still, schools may be warming to the idea of gunshot detection to address the threat of a campus shooter. In 2022, the school board in Manchester, New Hampshire, voted to implement ShotSpotter in the district’s schools after a series of active-shooter threats.
Other companies claim their technologies provide real-time visual weapons detection. Evolv is an AI screening system for detecting concealed weapons, which has been implemented in more than 400 school buildings since 2021. ZeroEyes and Omnilert are AI-assisted security camera systems that detect firearms and promise to notify authorities within seconds or minutes of a gun being detected.
These systems analyze surveillance video with AI programs trained to recognize a range of visual cues, including different types of guns and behavioral indicators of aggression. Upon recognizing a threat, the system notifies a human verification team, which can then activate a prescribed response plan.
But even these highly sophisticated systems can fail to detect a real threat, leading to questions about the utility of security technology. Antioch High School in Nashville, Tennessee, was equipped with Omnilert’s gun detection technology in January 2025 when a student walked inside the school building with a gun and shot several classmates, one fatally, before killing himself.

 Lack of evidence

This demonstrates an enduring problem with the school security technology industry: Most of these technologies are untested, and their effect on safety is unproven. Even gunshot detection systems have not been studied in the context of school and mass shootings outside of simulation studies. School shooting research has very little to offer in terms of assessing the value of these tools, because there are no studies out there.
This lack is partly due to the low incidence of mass and school shootings. Even with a broad definition of school shootings – any gunfire on school grounds resulting in injury – the annual rate across America is approximately 24 incidents per year. That’s 24 more than anyone would want, but it’s a small sample size for research. And there are few, if any, ethically and empirically sound ways to test whether a campus fortified with ShotSpotter or the newest AI surveillance cameras is less likely to experience an active shooter incident because the probability of that school being victimized is already so low.
Existing research provides a useful overview of the school safety technology landscape, but it offers little evidence of how well this technology actually prevents violence. The National Institute of Justice last published its Comprehensive Report on School Safety Technology in 2016, but its finding that the adoption of biometrics, “smart” cameras and weapons detection systems was outpacing research on the efficacy of the technology is still true today. The Rand Corporation and the University of Michigan Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention have produced similar findings that demonstrate limited or no evidence that these new technologies improve school safety and reduce risks.
While researchers can study some aspects of how the environment and security affect mass shooting outcomes, many of these technologies are too new to be included in studies, or too sparsely implemented to show any meaningful impact on outcomes.
My research on active and mass shootings has suggested that the security features with the most lifesaving potential are not part of highly technical systems: They are simple procedures like lockdowns during shootings.
 The tech keeps coming

Nevertheless, technological innovations continue to drive the school safety industry. Campus Guardian Angel, launched out of Texas in 2023, promises a rapid drone response to an active school shooter. Founder Justin Marston compared the drone system to “having a SEAL team in the parking lot.” At $15,000 per box of six drones, and an additional monthly service charge per student, the drones are equipped with nonlethal weaponry, including flash-bangs and pepper spray guns.
In late 2025, three Florida school districts announced their participation in Campus Guardian Angel’s pilot programs.
 


  Three school districts in Florida are part of a pilot program to test drones that respond to school shootings. 

There is no shortage of proposed technologies. A presentation from the 2023 International Conference on Computer and Applications described a cutting-edge architectural design system that integrates artificial intelligence and biometrics to bolster school security. And yet, the language used to describe the outcomes of this system leaned away from prevention, instead offering to “mitigate the potential” for a mass shooting to be carried out effectively.
While the difference is subtle, prevention and mitigation reflect two different things. Prevention is stopping something avoidable. Mitigation is consequence management: reducing the harm of an unavoidable hazard.
 Response versus prevention

This is another of the enduring limitations of most emerging technologies being advertised as mass shooting prevention: They don’t prevent shootings. They may streamline a response to a crisis and speed up the resolution of the incident. With most active shooter incidents lasting fewer than 10 minutes, time saved could have critical lifesaving implications.
But by the time ShotSpotter has detected gunshots on a college campus, or Campus Guardian Angel has been activated in the hallways of a high school, the window for preventing the shooting has long since passed.

As deadline looms, members struggle to agree.",Ginny Monk and Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/23/connecticut-towing-dmv-reform-overhaul/,The group was part of a legislative overhaul prompted by a CT Mirror/ProPublica investigation that found the state’s laws favored towing companies.,"This article was produced in partnership with ProPublica through its Local Reporting Network. Sign up for our newsletter to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.
As the Connecticut legislature overhauled the state’s towing laws last spring, lawmakers came up with a hopeful idea: gather towing companies, consumer advocates and state officials to hammer out a few arcane details that could have big implications for some Connecticut drivers whose cars are towed.
The ambitions of the task force, convened in response to a Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica investigation, grew quickly as it began to meet in September to come up with recommendations for the legislature. Perhaps they could make it easier for low-income people to get their towed cars back or prevent them from being towed at all. Maybe they could change the administrative process that sometimes made it hard to find owners of the cars, which frustrated drivers and towing companies alike.
But with a Feb. 1 deadline looming for its recommendations, the panel has made little progress on reaching a consensus.
That could pose hurdles for lawmakers who say towing practices are still unfair and want to pass more reforms during the legislative session that starts in February.
“We’re still anxiously, eagerly awaiting word from the working group on their recommendations,” said state Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, who co-chairs the Transportation Committee.
Until a few months ago, Connecticut residents’ cars were towed from their own apartment complexes without warning over minor issues like an expired parking sticker.
When those residents went to pick up their vehicles, towing companies often refused to take credit cards or even let owners get their belongings from inside their cars.
And if the owners didn’t have cash to pay the fees, which mounted every day, towing companies could ask the Department of Motor Vehicles for permission to sell some vehicles after just 15 days.
Much of that changed after a new law went into effect in October following the CT Mirror and ProPublica investigation that exposed how the state’s laws had come to favor towing companies over vehicle owners.
Towing companies must now give people warning before removing vehicles from apartment parking lots unless there’s a safety issue. The towers must accept credit cards and let people get their belongings. And although the sales process can begin after 15 days for vehicles worth less than $1,500, towers must wait 30 days before selling them.
Part of the new law also required that a DMV task force examine the process companies use to get rid of towed cars. Lawmakers said they especially wanted the group to look at what happens to profits from the sales of the towed vehicles. Currently, towing companies are supposed to hold onto proceeds for a year so owners or lenders can claim them. After that, any unclaimed funds, minus the towing costs and fees, are required to be turned over to the state. But CT Mirror and ProPublica found that hasn’t happened in part because the DMV never set up a system to collect the money.
The working group has met four times. They’ve talked about stopping towing fees from accumulating once vehicle owners indicate they want their cars back. They’ve also debated changing the way towing companies value cars, which determines how soon towers can start the sales process. DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera proposed scrapping the valuation system and letting companies sell all vehicles after 30 days.
And both consumer advocates and towing representatives complained about the process for notifying owners that their cars have been towed or are about to be sold. The system relies on the vehicle’s registration, which can often have out-of-date addresses. CT Mirror and ProPublica interviewed several people, particularly lower-income residents, who said they were never informed that their cars would be sold.
Yet at the most recent meeting Dec. 15, task force members couldn’t even agree on how many letters needed to be sent to vehicle owners. The meeting got heated on several occasions even as Guerrera warned the deadline to complete a report was approaching.
The working group hasn’t discussed how any proceeds should be given to the state.
Still, in an interview, Guerrera projected confidence that they would reach a compromise.
“You’ve got two sides here that are very passionate about what they believe in, and like any good piece of legislation that people try to draw up, it takes many times at the table to craft something that you can have individuals sign off at the end,” he said.
At Monday’s meeting, consumer advocate and attorney Raphael Podolsky said he was concerned the committee was missing some key issues including making sure people can get their vehicles back.
“I’m more concerned not how do you sell the car, but how do you make sure it never gets to that point?” Podolsky said.
Members of the towing industry argued against a DMV proposal that would mandate that companies send car owners a second certified letter when their vehicles are going to be sold, informing them of the date and location of the auction.
Eileen Colonese, secretary of the industry group Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said more letters won’t resolve the issue of addresses being wrong.
“You have to find out who the owner of the car is,” said Colonese of Farmington Motor Sports. “If we don’t solve that problem, all the rest of this is really a waste of everybody’s time and money.”
Towers and Guerrera proposed creating a DMV portal where towing companies would list every car towed and where it was being held.
Colonese said it’s difficult for the towers to agree to most of the proposals because they would add costs to companies. Transportation Committee ranking member Rep. Kathy Kennedy, R-Milford, is considering this question as well; “it’s their livelihood,” she said of the towing companies.
Cohen and her co-chair, Rep. Aimee Berger-Girvalo, D-Ridgefield, said they also want to see more transparency from the DMV after the news organizations found that a department employee faced little consequence for five years after an internal investigation found he had abused his power by trading favors for steep discounts on towed cars. The employee was fired last month. He appealed the decision and said he had done nothing wrong.
Guerrera said he wants the working group to have at least three recommendations before the legislature begins its three-month session. He said the group may have to meet twice more in January to come to an agreement. He warned if the group doesn’t reach a consensus, neither side will be happy with the report he plans to submit and what the legislature does from there.
“I’m going to submit the report after the next meeting or two meetings, and they can come back and go to the legislature and say, ‘I still don’t like it,’” Guerrera said. “But I am going to put down what I believe is something that is fair.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0908_SR_TowingMeetingDMV_106-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:12:09.816046

Some of the ex-officers wore red-striped outfits that identified them as the most dangerous inmates behind bars.
Parker, a 33-year-old Black man, had survived the abuse of these white officers, most of whom were part of a self-styled group called the “Goon Squad.” 
On the fateful night of Jan. 24, 2023, he heard officers kick in the door.
“I saw the devil come to me,” he told the judge in the sentencing hearing, “in my home, where I was supposed to have been safe.”
They had handcuffed him and his friend, Michael Jenkins, before they shocked them with Tasers, shoved a dildo into their mouths and poured liquids over their nostrils. 
Parker feared he would suffer the fate of his father, whose lung disease caused him to die gasping for air, he said. “I felt like I was dying and drowning at the same time.”
Not long after, a deputy jammed his gun inside Jenkins’ mouth and pulled the trigger. The bullet missed Jenkins’ spine and shattered his jaw.
In the courtroom, Parker stared at another deputy, the one he called a “devil” because he said he had overseen the violence that night. Parker told the judge, “He shouldn’t be let loose.”
That 29-year-old former deputy sat there, numb, wondering what the judge’s words would be.
In a series of exclusive interviews through phone calls and hundreds of emails with Mississippi Today over the past year, Christian Dedmon talked about the fraternity he found in law enforcement and his descent into cruelty. “I see Michael Jenkins bleeding in my sleep sometimes,” he said. “It is a nightmare I will spend the rest of my life paying for.”
‘Mindless murderers and sadistic torturers’
As early as he can remember, Dedmon hated drugs.
He hated what they did to his parents. He hated what they did to his friends. He even refused to take pain medication after being injured.
Born in 1994, he grew up as an only child in the shadow of Mississippi’s capital in the suburban city of Pearl. He was 2 when his parents divorced, and he bounced between them, from rental home to apartment to trailer.
One night when he was 12, he helped his father repossess a car. When they began to hook the car to the tow truck, people rushed out, screaming. During the tumult, his father closed the hydraulic arm too fast, cutting off two fingers from Dedmon’s left hand.
Doctors managed to reattach his index finger but could only save half his thumb. Four other surgeries followed, and Dedmon missed most of sixth grade. A few years later, he moved out, dropped out of high school and drove tow trucks, just like his dad.
He was 16 when he heard of a horrific murder in Jackson, Mississippi. A Black man, James C. Anderson, had been beaten and run over with a truck.
Then he heard that his first cousin, Deryl Dedmon, was involved in the attack with other Rankin County residents, most of them in their early 20s.
He felt sick. How could anyone do such a thing?
To support his cousin, Christian Dedmon attended the sentencing hearing, where U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves talked about the lynchings of more than 4,700 Black Americans between 1882 and 1968.

The judge detailed how this white mob of teenagers, like marauders of the past, invaded the city of Jackson, which they called “Jafrica.” They beat Black homeless men. They beat a Black man at a service station. They beat a Black man at a golf course who begged for his life.
“Like a lynching, for these young folk going out to ‘Jafrica’ was like a carnival outing,” the judge said. “It was funny to them — an excursion which culminated in the death of innocent, African-American James Craig Anderson. On June 26, 2011, the fun ended.”
Reeves posed a question that could have been asked later of the Goon Squad officers: “How could hate, fear or whatever it was transform genteel, God-fearing, God-loving Mississippians into mindless murderers and sadistic torturers?”
Deryl Dedmon, who ran over Anderson with his truck, received 50 years in prison.
Pam Lantrip, said her grandson, Christian Dedmon, was “really upset about his cousin going to prison for what was essentially a life sentence.”
She never dreamed this grandson, the one who never got into trouble, would be next.
Law enforcement became the ‘brotherhood’
While Dedmon was still a teen, a police officer he knew from deer camp invited him to ride along. Dedmon grew up cheering Chuck Norris as he beat up the bad guys on television, and now these rides lit “a fire within me,” he recalled.
At age 19, he became a 911 dispatcher for the Pearl Police Department, finished high school and got married. Months later, he learned his wife was pregnant. They listened to the baby’s heartbeat, and the obstetrician said everything looked fine.
Days later, she began to bleed, and he rushed her to the emergency room. A sonogram revealed there was no heartbeat. They wept at the awful news, the first of three miscarriages.
On the 15th anniversary of the 9-11 terrorist attack, Dedmon enrolled at the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers Training Academy. He graduated weeks before Christmas in 2016. 
Two months later, he and his wife had a daughter, their miracle baby, and Dedmon vowed to be “the daddy that I did not have.”
He worked as a patrol officer for Pearl police, and law enforcement became the “brotherhood” he had never experienced.
Not long after he joined the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department in 2017, his mother was arrested for selling meth. Inside her home, officers said they also found heroin, marijuana, fentanyl and a firearm.
“I spent his entire life trying to protect him from the world and from anyone who could hurt him,” recalled his mother, Jennifer Williams, “but at the end of the day I was the one who hurt him the worst.”
Dedmon said Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey asked him if he was going to have a problem with his mother being jailed there. Dedmon replied no, but the truth was, he was devastated. He said her arrest made him even more determined to get drugs off the street.

He spent extra time stopping cars and searching them. Through that work, he met narcotics investigator Brett McAlpin. All the meth users seemed to know McAlpin’s name.
Dedmon idolized McAlpin like a big brother. He said McAlpin convinced him they had to do more than arrest those using or selling drugs. They had to make these drug abusers pay. 
McAlpin taught him how to hit people so their injuries wouldn’t show up in their jail mugshots, and he didn’t use a Taser because it recorded every time it was used, Dedmon said. Instead, McAlpin “carried a huge piece of wire on his vest that would hurt if you were hit with it,” he said.
To get people to talk, McAlpin fired his gun in the air — a tactic that often worked, Dedmon said.
The pair didn’t stop there. Together, they destroyed the property of those they believed were using or selling drugs. They smashed food into people’s faces, berated them and told them to leave Rankin County. 
To get confessions, officers sometimes shoved guns into people’s mouths, and behind office doors, investigators would hit people “with phone books and whatever,” Dedmon said. “It’s daily operations up there.”
He came to believe this approach made their community safer for children, he said. “We made people scared to sell drugs, to use drugs or to steal.”
He realizes now how wrong that was. “My job was to clean up the streets while following the Constitution,” he said, “not to be the judge and jury in place of a failed justice system.”
Those who embraced McAlpin’s ways could go on “missions” with him, Dedmon recalled. Over the years, he said, more than a dozen different deputies joined in those missions.
Some deputies, however, steered clear of McAlpin and Dedmon. Two deputies from that time said they didn’t trust the pair because they had heard stories about those missions.
Some of them warned Dedmon about hanging out with McAlpin, who had a reputation for excessive force. “He wouldn’t listen,” recalled one former deputy, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. 
In January, Sheriff Bailey testified in a lawsuit that he knew nothing about the violence carried out by Dedmon, McAlpin and the others. 
Dedmon responded that “people being mistreated was no secret to anyone.” As long as he filled out a use-of-force report, the sheriff “didn’t give a shit what I did,” Dedmon said. “That took care of it.”
Mississippi Today and The New York Times corroborated at least 17 incidents involving 22 victims, based on witness interviews, medical records, photographs of injuries and other documents. Allegations in these incidents include everything from melting metal onto a bare leg to using a Taser to shock people in their genitals.
Dedmon estimates he arrested hundreds of people a year. Those included many cases where he said officers raided homes without warrants, beat people to get information and illegally seized evidence that helped convict people of drug crimes.
Despite this evidence of possible wrongful convictions, the state of Mississippi has yet to conduct a review of all the cases involving Dedmon and other officers now in prison.
Sheriff became the father he never had
In 2019, Dedmon was involved in three deadly shootings, firing the fatal shot in one of them. Each time, he saw a therapist, who signed the paper for him to return to work. Each time, he was back on the street in a few days.

Afterward, Sheriff Bailey bragged about his young deputy, who became Rankin County’s “Top Cop” for the year. “When we would go to political functions, he would say I was the ‘deadliest motherf—er in Rankin County’ to his friends and people around, being funny,” Dedmon recalled. “I never found it very funny.”
In fall 2019, McAlpin became the department’s top investigator. Former deputies said he became the sheriff’s right-hand man.
When the question arose about who would replace the veteran investigator, few doubted it would be Dedmon. Former deputies said they admired Dedmon’s hard work but bristled at his arrogance.
The new job was a dream come true for the 25-year-old Dedmon. He began to arrest as many people as he could, including his own father for meth possession.
Bailey became the father he never had. And like a son, Dedmon wanted to please his father. He said he did everything the sheriff asked him to do, including working with jail inmates to muck out the chicken houses of the sheriff’s mother.
In return, Dedmon and his wife said Bailey bought them an elegant dinner on Valentine’s Day. Other gifts followed. Dedmon said the sheriff made him executor for his will, promising him $50,000, a half-dozen guns and a flatbed Dodge truck. Family members and friends recalled Dedmon telling them this.
Dedmon said the sheriff had him handle cases involving personal or political connections. For instance, although he worked as a narcotics investigator, he said Bailey assigned him to investigate a near-fatal attack in 2019, carried out by the brother of Bailey’s girlfriend.
Clint Pennington slashed his wife so badly that doctors had to put more than 80 stitches in her back. “I am in constant fear — fear that he will somehow try to hurt me again,” his then-wife, Amanda, wrote. “I never feel safe.”
After Pennington pleaded guilty to aggravated domestic violence, the judge sentenced him to five years in prison. Pennington served his time instead at the Simpson County Jail, where he became a trusty. He walked free on Sept. 6, 2024, after spending three years and four months behind bars.
Dedmon said by doing such favors for the sheriff, he received “the power to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted, but it came with a price.”
His wife filed for divorce in 2020. “He was married to his job,” she said, asking not to be named for fear of retribution. “If he heard on the radio that somebody’s house was burning, he was out the door. If a child was missing, he was out the door. If a storm left a road blocked, he was out the door with a chainsaw.”
After a heated argument with Dedmon, she said she complained to McAlpin, who chastised her, “We are alpha males, and you can’t treat us like this.”
That moment made her realize she would receive no sympathy from this brotherhood, she said. “That was Christian’s family.”
The fateful ‘mission’
On the evening of Jan. 24, 2023, thunder rumbled as Dedmon prepared to fry venison for him and Josh Hartfield, a narcotics investigator for Richland Police Department, who had come by to chat. 
Dedmon’s cellphone rang. It was McAlpin. The chief investigator fumed about the home near where he lived in Braxton. A neighbor had seen “suspicious” Black men at the house owned by a white woman.
Dedmon knew the home well. In recent years, several narcotics arrests had taken place there, and two years earlier, he had worked a drug homicide inside the home.
He said McAlpin told him to look out for cameras, lock up everyone there and make sure there were no bad mugshots.
The deputy asked Hartfield if he wanted to go. He did.
Dedmon texted fellow deputies and asked if they could go on a mission. Lt. Jeffrey Middleton, whose shift was called the “Goon Squad,” replied yes. So did patrol deputies Hunter Elward and Daniel Opdyke.
After they arrived, Dedmon and others kicked in the carport door. Harfield kicked open the back door.
For the two Black men inside, Eddie Parker and Michael Jenkins, the nightmare had just begun.
For an hour and a half, officers tortured the two men. After Jenkins continued to deny he knew anything about drugs, Elward jammed his pistol inside Jenkins’ mouth and pulled the trigger.

The gun didn’t fire because the deputy had unloaded the chamber.
He racked the slide again, and when Jenkins repeated that he knew nothing, Elward pulled the trigger again. This time, a bullet smashed through Jenkins’ tongue and shattered his jaw.

As Jenkins lay bleeding, the officers dashed outside. Dedmon recalled McAlpin yelling, “Let me think, let me think.”
The officers planted drugs, disposed of evidence of their crimes and created a cover story. McAlpin and Middleton warned officers that if they failed to stick to this story, “they could find us all dead together,” Dedmon recalled.
When the two supervisors later saw Dedmon texting on his cellphone, they demanded to know who he was talking to, he recalled. He said they glared at him when he told them he was letting his girlfriend know he would be late.
Dedmon called for an ambulance, and when the sheriff arrived, the officers shared their concocted story of seizing the two men’s drugs and shooting Jenkins in self-defense. Bailey seemed satisfied.
When the sheriff saw that two deputies had turned off their body cameras, he became upset. He expected them to be turned on, but, as he later testified, he didn’t realize there was an exception for narcotics operations.
This wasn’t the only thing Bailey was upset about, according to two deputies present. They said Bailey mentioned the deadline to file for running for sheriff was Feb. 1, eight days from then.
Dedmon said Bailey called it “a bad time for him to have drama that close to an election qualification” because “someone else could put their name in the hat to run for election.”
Opdyke, another deputy there, said Bailey “was upset because it would bring bad publicity — as if we would’ve waited until after he was elected again, he would’ve swept it under the rug and we would’ve all been fine.”
The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, which investigates every officer-involved shooting, issued a press release: “Rankin County Sheriff’s Department deputies were conducting a narcotics investigation when they encountered a subject that displayed a gun towards the deputies. The subject was transported to a nearby hospital.”
The next day, Dedmon said the sheriff texted him, saying his Taser use would have the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department on the national news. His Taser had been fired four times and Elward’s, eight times.
Hartfield had denied using his Taser, but an internal investigation at the Richland Police Department determined he had fired it five times. The department demoted him, suspended him for two weeks without pay and placed him on administrative leave with pay.
At the Sheriff’s Department, McAlpin and Middleton continued to supervise their divisions. Dedmon, however, was assigned desk duty. “I felt sad, scared and miserable,” he said. “No one would speak to me, so I just started staying home.”
He saw the situation as a lose-lose proposition: Say nothing and risk prison time. Or tell the truth and risk being killed.
‘I knew my life was over’
Dedmon headed for the woods dressed in camouflage. He had his .270 Remington rifle. It was still deer season, his favorite time of year. Today, he had another prey in mind: himself.
He arrived before dawn and sat in the deer stand, watching the dark sky brighten into blue. Soon, streaks of yellow appeared. Then orange and red.
When a buck wandered up, Dedmon said he stared through the scope at the antlers stretching in all directions. He took aim but couldn’t bring himself to pull the trigger.
After the deer disappeared, he fired the rifle. The sound spooked him, and he left.
Each morning that followed, he had a different excuse for why he shouldn’t kill himself. One day, he worried about his daughter. On another, he thought suicide seemed scarier than what he would face behind bars. On yet another, he trembled at the thought of facing God for what he had done.
“I was caught between wanting to drink myself to death, tell the truth or just end it all,” he said. “I knew my life was over.”
Middleton and McAlpin kept reaching out to make sure he stuck to the cover story, Dedmon said. McAlpin had cheered on the torture of the two men, but now he wanted “to make it look like he was never on the scene. He used me to do it and threatened to kill me if I changed my mind.”
But when MBI agents began to question that story, McAlpin grew paranoid, Dedmon said. “He started acting insane.”
Dedmon continued to spiral downward. No longer receiving overtime pay for his narcotics work, he struggled financially. He said he texted the sheriff and asked if he could work on the chicken farm for extra money.
The sheriff never texted back, but a deputy showed up with a sealed envelope, Dedmon said. After the deputy left, he tore it open and counted the cash: $1,000.
‘Policemen can’t go to jail’
On July 13, 2023, Deputy Daniel Opdyke met with FBI agents, federal prosecutors and Justice Department officials. This time, he shared the whole story of what happened that night.
McAlpin confronted Dedmon outside a gas station. “He told me he was going to talk to the feds the following day and wanted to be sure I was going to continue to lie about him not being there,” Dedmon recalled. “He said, ‘Our lives are on the line. Don’t f— it up.’”
Dedmon was the last deputy to talk with the feds, and he volunteered little. Not long after, his attorney, Michael Cory, called and told him the feds were estimating he would receive a 24-year prison sentence. If he didn’t plead guilty, he was told, the feds planned to also indict him for kidnapping.
Cory said he let Dedmon know that he wasn’t so sure about the 24-year figure, given what he estimated the range would be under the federal sentencing guidelines.

Dedmon thought about his life. The joy he felt in becoming a law enforcement officer. The joy he felt in becoming a father. And now the despair he felt about serving more than two decades in prison. 
That meant he would miss his daughter’s high school graduation. He would miss her leaving home. He might even miss walking her down the aisle at her wedding.
The night before pleading guilty, he handed his law enforcement certificate and awards over to Nick McLendon, chief of the Richland Police Department, and asked him to use these items to warn cadets at the training academy about compromising their integrity.
The next day, Dedmon pleaded guilty to federal charges in the torture of Jenkins and Parker and spent his first night in jail. When his 7-year-old daughter learned that he wouldn’t be coming home, Dedmon’s mother quoted her as saying, “What do you mean he’s in jail? Policemen can’t go to jail.”

Hours after five of his deputies pleaded guilty to federal charges on Aug. 3, 2023, Bailey held a press conference, where he apologized to the victims but never mentioned them by name. 
He placed his hand on his chest. “My moral boundary is set by my Christian faith,” Bailey said. “Do I cross that boundary? Sometimes I do. These guys were so far past that boundary, it’s unbelievable.”
Asked how he didn’t know what these deputies were doing, he replied, “That’s what I have supervisors for.” What he didn’t mention was that two of his supervisors had been among those pleading guilty.
When a reporter said some residents were calling for his resignation, the sheriff laughed. “The only thing I’m guilty of in this incident is trusting grown men that swore an oath to do their job correctly.”
Asked if he thought these deputies could have committed similar acts in the past, Bailey replied, “I’d say anything is possible right now.”
Dedmon said for the sheriff “to act as if these five guys are the only people under his nose that used unnecessary force is a lie.”
Asked about Dedmon’s allegations, the department’s attorney, Jason Dare, responded that Dedmon is “a convicted felon – convicted of falsifying evidence.”
An investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times has revealed that a loose-knit group of Rankin County deputies had carried out a campaign of terror for two decades. They barged into homes in the middle of the night and tortured people they suspected of buying or selling drugs until they shared information.
“If the gun had not gone off that night and shot one of the victims through the mouth, there is a good chance the Goon Squad would still be operating,” said Jackson lawyer Jeffrey Reynolds, who represented Opdyke.
‘He hid behind his badge and gun’
The day before his sentencing on March 24, 2024, Dedmon heard on the radio that Elward had received 20 years in prison. He figured his sentence would be close to that. Twenty-two people had written letters of support, and some planned to testify.
An hour before his sentencing, his lawyer told him the judge was going to give him 40 years. “It was like being struck by lightning,” Dedmon recalled. “He told me it would do zero good for any of my character witnesses to speak, that Judge Lee had his mind made up.”
In the courtroom, Michael Jenkins called Dedmon “the worst example of a police officer in the United States.”
Michael Jenkins was in Rankin County Circuit Court, Monday, Aug. 14, 2023, to hear the guilty pleas of the officers accused of beating and torturing them in January.
In a statement, Jenkins said, “Every time I try to take a bite of food, the pain reminds me of what happened that night. All the things I used to enjoy doing in my life have been affected.”
The gunshot wound to the jaw has affected both his singing and drumming at church, he said. At night, he wakes up covered in sweat because of nightmares of the attack, he said. “I’m broken inside. I don’t ever think I will be the person that I was.”
Dedmon’s attorney told the judge the torture that took place that night was nothing new. “Everybody knew that was the culture of the department,” he said.
McAlpin, who received 27 years, put the whole attack in motion by ordering Dedmon to take care of the problem, the attorney said. “It’s an injustice to sentence Christian Dedmon to significantly more time than his supervisor, who was there, who initiated it, who didn’t stop it.”
Assistant U.S. Attorney Erin Chalk said Dedmon faced an additional charge  in an unrelated case for firing his gun to try and scare a confession out of a man he had pulled over to the side of the road. Although he was young, he knew what he was doing, she said. “He hid behind his badge and gun.”
Dedmon apologized to Parker and Jenkins, saying he would never forgive himself for what he did. “If I could take every bit of it back, I promise you I would, or if I could take it myself, I would.”
A year after the sentencings, Parker told Mississippi Today that he forgives his torturers. “I do, because they know not what they did,” he said. “That’s the way God put it on my heart.”
What concerns him is that other officers involved in similar conduct have yet to face charges. “They got nothing, not even a slap on the wrist,” he said. “It’s scary knowing that kind of danger is out there, walking free.”
For more than a year, Parker said he never left the house where he was tortured. After he began to leave, officers sometimes pulled him over and searched his car. He said he welcomed these searches because it gave him an opportunity to share his story.

But after Louisiana officers searched his car on Dec. 17, they arrested him. He now faces charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of cocaine, methamphetamine and ecstasy. He is also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm.
Parker had a felony in Rankin County for failing to “stop vehicle pursuant to officer’s signal” and was convicted in Alabama in 2019 for drug possession with intent to distribute.
Dedmon said he finds no joy in Parker’s arrest. “Prison is a very traumatic experience, and it would be very hard for me to wish this on anyone,” he said. “I truly wish him the best and pray that he uses this opportunity to turn his life around before he ends up with a sentence as lengthy as mine.”
‘Hell of a brotherhood, isn’t it?’
Dedmon said he entered law enforcement, “not as a devil, but to make a difference in the community.”
He doesn’t blame Jenkins and Parker for seeing him that way. “I can’t change their view of me,” he said. “I can only change the man I am from this point forward.”
He said he thanks God that Jenkins “is alive. Nothing about me matters.”
These days in prison, he sits with others battling suicidal thoughts. “I’m expected to set an example,” he said, “yet on the inside I’m dying.”
His life brightened in June when he married his longtime girlfriend. There was no ceremony. Instead, a Kansas pastor wed the pair by phone.
He is slated to be released from prison in 2057 — three years after his cousin, Deryl. By that time, Dedmon will be celebrating his 63rd birthday and eligible for Social Security.
“I’m sitting here with a life sentence while a number of those who did the same kinds of things I did have gotten promotions,” he said. “Hell of a brotherhood, isn’t it?”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/18132958/MT-ChristianDedmon-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:12:09.816046
