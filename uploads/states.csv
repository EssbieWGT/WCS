Buffalo, N.Y.
Died Oct. 17, 2025
Stamford, N.Y.

Anne Pratt Slatin passed away on Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, at The Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, N.Y., at the age of 80 from pneumonia.
She was born on Oct. 31, 1944, in Buﬀalo, New York, to Mary McNeil and Wilson Holly Pratt. Her early summers were spent at Camp Otsego in Cooperstown, where she began as a camper and later taught sailing — friendships from those years stayed with her for life.
In 1979, Anne married Dr. Harvey L. Slatin in their apartment in New York City, and later that year their daughter, Emily, was born. In 1986, the family moved to Stamford, N.Y., where Emily grew up and where Anne would spend the rest of her life.
Anne gave much of herself to Stamford. She served for many years as a village trustee and later became the first woman to be elected mayor, serving a two-year term. She was also a longtime member of the Stamford Village Library Board, committed to supporting the institutions that made the town stronger.
In her professional life, Anne worked as a self-employed genealogist, helping families trace their histories and reconnect with their roots.
In her later years, Anne volunteered with the Middletown Springs Historical Society in Middletown Springs, Vermont, near the retired dairy farm owned by her daughter, Emily, and Emily’s wife, Amelia. She loved both places and gave her time freely to the communities that mattered most to her.
She loved animals, especially cats, and delighted in the company of Penfold, her daughter’s dog, who always made her smile. That aﬀection also shaped her support for Heart of the Catskills, a cause close to her heart.
She is survived by her daughter, Emily Pratt Slatin, and Emily’s wife, Amelia Phoenix Desertsong; her sister, Mary Ellen Pratt-Phillips; and Loralei Jurztrenka, who first cared for Anne as a nurse and, in time, became a cherished part of the family’s life. She was predeceased by her husband, Harvey; her sister, Holly E. Keller; and her lifelong friends Frank and Carol Bell, and Ellen Wayman, of Stamford, and Richard “Dick” Woodhouse of Cooperstown.
Anne preferred simplicity over ceremony. At her request, there will be no calling hours or funeral.
The family extends their heartfelt gratitude to the doctors, nurses and staﬀ at The Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown for their extraordinary care and compassion during Anne’s final days.
Her final wishes were to be cremated and buried without ceremony at Lakewood Cemetery in Cooperstown, New York. Contributions in her memory may be made to the Stamford Village Library, the Stamford Fire Department, or Heart of the Catskills.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bruce Cole.","Born April 19, 1933
Medford, Massachusetts
Died Dec. 24, 2025
Marlboro, Vermont
Details of services
He has been laid to rest in King Cemetery in Marlboro. A celebration of life for Bruce will be held mid-April 2026. Letters of condolence can be sent to the family at P.O. Box 133, Marlboro, Vermont 05344.

Bruce Cole, 92, of Marlboro, passed away peacefully on Dec. 24, 2025, surrounded by his family. Born on April 19, 1933, in Medford, Massachusetts, Bruce was the son of Barbara Sawyer Cole and the Rev. Alfred Storer Cole of Wilmington, Vermont.
Bruce’s life was defined by hard work, compassion, a sense of humor, and an unwavering commitment to family and community. It was in Boston where he met his lifelong partner and greatest love, Barbara Draper. They were both young dreamers working and aspiring to become veterinarians at Angell Memorial Animal Hospital. Their shared passion for learning and service became the foundation of a love that lasted 70 beautiful years.
Bruce began his education at Tufts University, where his father taught, and later attended the Massachusetts College of Agriculture. He served his country with dedication in the Army Dental Corps in North Carolina during the Korean War. In 1959, he and Barbara graduated from Marlboro College, a place that remained a touchstone throughout his life and career.
In the early 1960s, they bought an old farmhouse in Wilmington, Vermont. With tireless energy and care, transformed the surrounding woods and fields into a working farmstead. A place of animals, shared work and laughter. It became their home for six decades, where they raised their five children and created a lifetime of family memories. For his grandchildren, it was a place of learning, adventure and love, where the roots of family were deeply planted.
Both Bruce and Barbara pursued careers in education with joy and purpose. After earning teaching certifications, Bruce went on to earn two master’s degrees and was later recognized with an Honorary Master’s in Education from Marlboro College. His passion for learning took him beyond the classroom — including a sabbatical in 1975 to study the English Primary System in England, and participation in an archaeological dig in Farfa, Italy, in 1981. These experiences enriched his teaching and inspired the many children whose lives he touched.
Bruce’s tenure at Marlboro Elementary School was truly remarkable. As a teaching principal, he upheld high standards with warmth, creativity and deep respect for every child.  He had a rare ability to see potential in others and lift people up – meeting people where they were, encouraging confidence and helping them believe in themselves. His approach, ahead of its time, nurtured curiosity, resilience, and confidence, creating a safe and supportive environment where children felt valued and capable. Decades of students, families and colleagues continue to hold him in the highest regard, carrying his lessons of encouragement.
Bruce found meaning in shared work and time spent together. He spent countless hours alongside his children and family—mowing lawns, painting houses and caring for the farm. After-school and summer days were filled with cutting and stacking firewood, sugaring, shoveling snow, tending to animals and skiing at Hogback Mountain. In these everyday moments, he taught by example, showing that love often looks like showing up, pitching in and doing things side by side.
For fifteen years, Bruce, Barbara, and their five children welcomed the community to Maple Ridge Farm Camp on the hillside in Wilmington. Here, campers would learn how to care for animals, develop an appreciation for nature and the outdoors, and be enthralled by wild stories Bruce told around the campfire during the weekly campouts. Camp excursions in the yellow school bus to oceans and mountains sparked friendships and fostered a lifelong love of animals and the outdoors. The camp reflected Bruce’s gentle guidance, patience, and belief in learning through experience.
Bruce was a husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, teacher, mentor, neighbor, and friend. He volunteered at the Deerfield Valley Health Center, the Diversion Board, Deerfield Valley Fair, Windham County Conservation District, Marlboro Cares and Marlboro School Association.  Bruce is survived by his beloved wife, Barbara, and his children, Bridget Cole, Dianna Driller (Ron) of Tahoe City, CA, Scott Cole (Jody) of Richmond, VT, Andrew Cole (Jennifer Langdon) of Kilauea, HI and Jennifer Nilsen (Karl) of Wilmington, VT.
He was a proud grandfather to 10 grandchildren: Courtney, Colin, Caitlin, Abigail, Tenaya, Garret, Nicholas, Gunnar, Eve & Mara. And 4 great-grandchildren. Bruce also leaves extended family, friends, and many former students who still call him Mr. Cole.
He will be deeply missed for his quick wit and sarcasm delivered in his Boston accent and the steady, comforting presence he brought into the lives of those around him. He lived with integrity and humility and made time for everyone he encountered, always ready with a story, a helping hand,  or quiet encouragement.
No words can truly capture who Bruce was or the depth of the impact he made; that is something felt in the hearts of all who knew him. Think of him every time you enjoy a cup of coffee, mow a lawn, split wood, paint a house, fire up a green machine, listen to NPR, pour real Vermont maple syrup over your pancakes or catch a glimpse of an old Dodge Dart.

Allen Reavis, R-Atchison, appears for a Dec. 17, 2025, recording of the Kansas Reflector podcast. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — As freshmen legislators last year, Rep. Allen Reavis and Rep. Lon Pishny began having conversations about about the unspoken impact state laws and regulations have on city and county governments.
Bills were being debated, Reavis said, “and it just felt like the effect it would have on local government wasn’t being fully measured.”
“If you’re a legislator who lives in a large city, you may not have the understanding of what happens in a small town with that same legislation,” he added.
Reavis, an Atchison Republican, and Pishny, a Garden City Republican, realized they needed to find a way to help educate and work with their peers. Their idea was to bring together lawmakers with experience serving in or working for local governments, and they formed the bipartisan Local Government Caucus to address their concerns.


They appeared on the Kansas Reflector podcast with Nathan Eberline, executive director of the League of Kansas Municipalities, to talk about the caucus.
“I’m concerned that we’re doing one-size-fits-all legislation in Topeka,” Pishny said. “We mandate it and pass it out to 105 counties when there’s such a variation in operations among those 105.”
Much of the tension flows from a combination of the Legislature mandating local government services, then trying to regulate local property taxes. For a while, the Legislature capped local property tax increases at the rate of inflation. Then, in 2021, the Legislature imposed a confusing “revenue neutral rate.”
That means cities and counties have to lower their property tax rate each year to offset gains in property values — and then send notices and hold public meetings before returning to the same rate as before.
Rep. Lon Pishny, R-Garden City (left), and Nathan Eberline, executive director of the League of Kansas Municipalities, appear for a Dec. 17, 2025, recording of the Kansas Reflector podcast. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)
Pishny said the revenue neutral rate was “troubling,” even if the premise was admirable.
“I pay taxes in multiple counties in Kansas, and I would prefer not to pay any more either,” he said. “However, I do want that fire truck to show up at my house, or that ambulance to show up at my house, and some of the services are extremely important.”
Pishny served on the Finney County Commission for 10 years before being elected to his Kanas House seat. Reavis said he spent 13 years in city government and two years with the county before being elected to the House.
They have identified about 40 legislators between the 125-member House and 40-member Senate who have local government experience. They said most are on board with the new caucus, and leadership supports the effort.
But, Pishny said, some remain skeptical.
“Leadership has even cautioned us they don’t want another lobbying group, and that’s not what we’re about,” Pishny said. “We are about education and information and helping people understand the role of local government and what the differences are across the state.”
Reavis said they don’t want to initiate legislation but would like to be responsive to bills and serve as a resource.
They identified several proposals already on their radar, including one that would eliminate a requirement that the Legislature approve local sales tax initiatives and just let local voters decide. They are also interested in discussion about franchise fees, which are charged to a utility to use public rights of way. There could be a challenge to the three-mile zoning jurisdiction that cities have in unincorporated areas. And they could see another wave of efforts to limit local property taxes.

Eberline recalled past efforts by the Legislature to eliminate certain costs, such as mortgage registration fees.
“I remember saying at the time, ‘Well, the more that you do this, the more you shift to the property taxes.’ Those services don’t go away,” Eberline said.
“And so here we are, 10 years later, and everybody’s frustrated by the property tax discussion,” he added.
Eberline said the communities that are thriving in Kansas tend to have something in common.
“It almost always tends to be the place where the city is working with the county is working with the state legislators, and they do have this idea of shared governance, a shared constituency, and the idea that we’re in this together,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC170001-1024x671.jpg,,,2026-01-05 09:57:21.704842

(Photo courtesy of the Office of the Governor)Gov. Tim Walz ended his campaign for a historic third-term on Monday amid mounting pressure from members of his own party and intense attacks from Republicans over widespread fraud in state-run social services programs.
Walz defended his record in a statement and said he was certain he could win a third term, but couldn’t give his entire attention to rooting out fraud while running a campaign.
“I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work,” Walz said in a statement.
Walz will speak to the press at 11 a.m. Monday.
Some Democratic-Farmer-Labor elected officials have quietly worried for months that Walz’s name at the top of the ticket would hand Republicans the governorship for the first time in 15 years and sink Democrats’ prospects down the ballot.
Walz faced a crowded field of Republicans challengers including House Speaker Lisa Demuth, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and former congressional candidate Kendall Qualls.
U.S. Sen. Amy Kloubuchar, Attorney General Keith Ellison and Secretary of State Steve Simon are possible candidates in a Democratic primary which would take place in August.



Read Gov. Tim Walz’s full statement:
Good morning, and Happy New Year.
Like many Minnesotans, I was glad to turn the page on 2025. It was an extraordinarily difficult year for our state. And it ended on a particularly sour note.
For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state’s generosity. And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.
I won’t mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St. Paul, and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place. They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family. They’ve already begun by taking our tax dollars that were meant to help families afford child care. And they have no intention of stopping there.
Make no mistake: We should be concerned about fraud in our state government. We cannot effectively deliver programs and services if we can’t earn the public’s trust. That’s why, over the past few years, we’ve made systemic changes to the way we do business.
We’ve gone to the legislature time and again to get more tools to combat fraud. We’ve fired people who weren’t doing their jobs. We’ve seen people go to jail for stealing from our state. We’ve cut off whole streams of funding, in partnership with the federal government, where we saw widespread criminal activity. We’ve put new locks on the doors of our remaining programs, and we’ve hired a new head of program integrity to make sure those locks can’t be broken.
All across the state, Minnesotans are hard at work on this problem. Advocates, administrators, investigators are on the front lines defending the integrity of our state’s programs, and I want to thank them for their efforts.
There’s more to do. A single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar too much to tolerate. And while there’s a role to play for everyone – from the legislature to prosecutors to insurance companies to local and county government – the buck stops with me. My administration is taking fast, decisive action to solve this crisis. And we will win the fight against the fraudsters.
But the political gamesmanship we’re seeing from Republicans is only making that fight harder to win.
We’ve got Republicans here in the legislature playing hide-and-seek with whistleblowers.
We’ve got conspiracy theorist right-wing YouTubers breaking into daycare centers and demanding access to our children.
We’ve got the President of the United States demonizing our Somali neighbors and wrongly confiscating childcare funding that Minnesotans rely on.
It is disgusting. And it is dangerous.
Republicans are playing politics with the future of our state. And it’s shameful. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: We welcome ideas from anyone, in any party, who wants to help us continue to stay ahead of the criminals.
And we welcome the involvement of the federal government. I’m grateful to the career professionals at the U.S. Attorney’s office and the FBI who are helping us win this fight.
But I cannot abide the actions of the political leadership in Washington – these opportunists who are willing to hurt our people to score a few cheap points. They and their allies have no intention of helping us solve the problem – and every intention of profiting off of it.
Which brings me to this: 2026 is an election year. And election years have a way of ramping up the politics at a time when we simply can’t afford more politics.
In September, I announced that I would run for a historic third term as Minnesota’s Governor. And I have every confidence that, if I gave it my all, I would succeed in that effort.
But as I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all. Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.
So I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.
I know this news may come as a surprise. But I’m passing on the race with zero sadness and zero regret. After all, I didn’t run for this job so I could have this job. I ran for this job so I could do this job. Minnesota faces an enormous challenge this year. And I refuse to spend even one minute of 2026 doing anything other than rising to meet the moment. Minnesota has to come first – always.
That’s what I believe servant leadership demands of me. And as an optimist, I will hold out some hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will consider what servant leadership demands of them in this moment. We can work together to combat the criminals, rebuild the public’s trust, and make our state stronger. But make no mistake: If Republicans continue down this path of abusing power, smearing entire communities, and running their own fraudulent game at the expense of Minnesotans – we will fight back every step of the way.
I’m confident that a DFLer will hold this seat come November. I’m confident that I will find ways to contribute to the state I love even after I’ve left office next January. But there will be time to worry about all that later.
Today, I’m proud of the work we’ve done to make Minnesota America’s best place to live and raise kids – from our new paid leave policy to our child tax credit to our free lunch program.
And I’m doubly proud of the incredible team we’ve put together to make that vision a reality. Thank you to every member of my staff, and every state employee, who’s part of this fight. We need you on the job to tackle the important work ahead.
Most of all, I want Minnesotans to know that I’m on the job, 24/7, focused on making sure we stay America’s best place to live and raise kids. No one will take that away from us. Not the fraudsters. And not the President. Not on my watch.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54916277197_74d814f6e6_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 09:57:21.704842

HOST: Laura Colarusso 
GUESTS: Jennifer Smith, Chris Lisinski, Jordan Wolman, Hallie Claflin







COMMONWEALTH BEACON is officially wrapping up 2025 and looking ahead to the stories that need to be told across Massachusetts in 2026. From major environmental scoops to local news in Gateway Cities to Beacon Hill happenings, our reporters covered a swath of issues last year, and many of those storylines will continue to unfold in the new year.  
On this week’s episode of The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon editor Laura Colarusso sits down with reporters Jennifer Smith, Chris Lisinski, Jordan Wolman, and Hallie Claflin to discuss the team’s major stories in 2025 and what they will be covering on each of their beats in 2026.  
Just weeks after joining the newsroom in September, Wolman uncovered that Rep. Mark Cusack, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, used Gov. Maura Healey’s pending energy affordability bill as a legislative vehicle to put forth a measure to weaken the state’s 2030 climate commitments. The House didn’t move forward with the legislation following intense backlash, but it’s still on the table for next year.  
“Deep-blue state of Massachusetts walking back from its 2030 climate commitments is not a headline that, at least in November, House leadership was comfortable with,” Wolman said. “I think that we can look for a clearer compromise between what the governor had proposed and what was put forth in this trial balloon.”  
Lisinski, who also joined the team in September but has been covering the Statehouse for years, explained how President Trump’s second term dominated Beacon Hill in 2025. Looking ahead to 2026, he will continue covering the state’s budget pressures as Massachusetts faces sizeable tax revenue losses over a two-year span.  
“The budget writers in the Legislature and in the Healey administration have been growing more and more worried about how much the state is collecting in tax revenue. They have been lifting up every metaphorical couch cushion, trimming spending here and there,” Lisinski said. “That’s just going to continue to get worse with the existence of … the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”  
Claflin joined the team in July to cover the state’s 26 Gateway Cities. In September, she followed up with leaders, health care workers, and first responders in Leominster to examine how the city and region is dealing with the loss of its maternity unit two years later. In 2026, she will continue to monitor hospital and health care service closures in Gateway Cities. 
“Gateway Cities are particularly vulnerable when it comes to those kinds of closures. The payer mix is often challenging for hospitals that are already struggling financially – lots and lots of folks [are] on Medicaid and Medicare in those cities,” Claflin said. “I think there’s going to be more stories to tell there.”  
One of Smith’s deep dives in 2025 shed light on geographic disparities across the state when it comes to health care access. From downtown Boston, getting to a hospital or health center can be as straightforward as walking a few blocks in any direction. But in more far-flung regions of the state, a long drive or a patchwork of transit modes can stand between someone in need of health care and the place best able to provide it. In 2026, she plans to cover a plethora of topics.  
“One that I am excited to sink into a bit in the new year is this question of ‘What exactly can Massachusetts do if there’s a federal government that doesn’t seem aligned with the way that its voters would like the state to run?’” Smith said. “Often some of its only toolkits are ‘Well I guess you have to go sue the federal government in court.’”

“There are no ceremonial offices right now,” Gray, a Democrat, said in an interview last week. “No one can afford to sit it out or stand on the sidelines.”

BURLINGTON — Molly Gray, the former Vermont lieutenant governor who also ran, unsuccessfully, for a seat in Congress, wants her old job back.
Gray announced her campaign for the state’s second-highest office Monday morning at a coffee shop in the South End of Burlington. Gray is running as a Democrat; if she wins the party’s primary in August, she’ll likely face current Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, a Republican first elected to the post in 2024, in the general election in November.
In Vermont, the lieutenant governor has few day-to-day responsibilities besides presiding over the state Senate when it’s in session. But those in the position can, and often do, use it to advocate for certain issues. Gray said she would be a stronger opponent of President Donald Trump’s administration, and the policies and proposals coming from the White House, than Rodgers has been in his first year in the post.
“There are no ceremonial offices right now,” Gray, who’s from Newbury though now lives in Burlington, said in an interview last week. “No one can afford to sit it out or stand on the sidelines at a time where the fundamental rights of Vermonters are under attack — regularly.”
(To be sure, Rodgers has said he does not support Trump and spoke against some of the administration’s actions at a major anti-Trump protest in Montpelier in April.)
Gray was elected lieutenant governor in 2020 after beating out a crowded field of Democratic primary opponents. She was in the job for less than a year before launching her campaign for what was then an open U.S. House seat. After a bruising campaign, she lost the primary to Becca Balint, who easily won the general election that fall.
After leaving office in 2023, Gray was tapped to serve as the first executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance. The Burlington-based nonprofit supports Afghans who are resettling in the state, offering a variety of programs such as a driver education initiative tailored to women who were not allowed to drive in their home country.
Gray said that role has given her firsthand experience with what she called the “extreme cruelty” of the Trump administration’s policies. She pointed, for example, to how the administration has paused visa and other programs for Afghan nationals, while those already in the country have also been stripped of temporary permission to stay.
“It’s ongoing chaos, right?” Gray said. “It’s been one blow after another.”
In addition to using the office’s bully pulpit to respond to news from Washington, D.C., Gray said she’s motivated to run for lieutenant governor again because of her own experiences — giving birth to her son, Jack, since she has left office, as well as caring for her mother, who lives in Newbury and has multiple sclerosis.
“I’ve experienced firsthand a health care system in crisis. Trying to access rural care in rural Vermont is extremely challenging right now,” she said. “We’re deeply concerned, as I think many, many families and many Vermonters are.”
Gray said that if she wins this year’s election, she is not interested in leaving the role for higher office, as she tried to do in 2022. That includes both running for governor and a seat in Congress, she said.
“If I’m lucky enough to earn the support of Vermonters — and have the chance to work for them again — I’ll stay in the job as long as there’s ability to problem solve and to get things done,” Gray said.
No other Democrats had formally announced a 2026 campaign for lieutenant governor as of Monday morning.

California legislators return to Sacramento today to kick off the second year of the Legislature’s two-year session. In addition to dealing with a state budget deficit projected to reach nearly $18 billion this year and a 2026 primary election, lawmakers will introduce and weigh in on new bills. Expect many: In 2025, more than 900 bills were sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk.
One proposal in the pipeline is a bill that would enable Californians to file lawsuits against federal agents. Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco drafted the bill in response to ongoing immigration raids under President Donald Trump. Assemblymember Mark González, a Los Angeles Democrat, also introduced a measure that aims to restore the 988 suicide and crisis hotline for LGBTQ+ callers in L.A. County, following Trump’s elimination of the specialized service.
California Republicans in the Senate also laid out their priorities going into the year, which would require considerable bipartisan support given the Democrat’s super-majority in the Legislature. The GOP’s top issues include funding the implementation of the anti-crime measure Proposition 36, investigating Medi-Cal fraud and addressing the state’s high cost of living. 
Many new California laws went into effect on Thursday as well, including ones that allow residents to get grant money for new roofs, require tortilla products to contain folic acid and mandate consumers to pay an extra fee on products with a non-removable battery. Read our rundown on the new laws that could affect your life, and check out the most talked-about measures from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.
Meanwhile, two state laws facing legal challenges from critics have been blocked by federal judges. One measure, which passed last year, grants the state more authority to regulate working conditions for private-sector employees. And on Friday a federal appeals court ruled that the state’s 2023 law restricting concealed firearms is unconstitutional.

Another go for mandatory kindergarten?

Speaking of new bills, California lawmakers plan to reintroduce a proposal requiring parents or legal guardians to enroll their 5-year-olds in school. Though the Legislature has attempted to mandate kindergarten nearly a half dozen times in past years, some legislators are optimistic that a bill could advance this year, reports CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
Data shows that children who attend kindergarten have higher math and reading test scores, are more likely to graduate high school and are less likely to drop out of school. But while California requires all school districts to offer kindergarten, it doesn’t require families to enroll their children. 
State Sen. Susan Rubio, a West Covina Democrat, unsuccessfully proposed two bills to make kindergarten mandatory. One died in the appropriations committee in 2024; the other was spiked by Newsom in 2022, who cited budget restrictions. 
But this year could be different, Rubio says, because the Legislature experienced a significant turnover since it last voted on a kindergarten bill in 2024. Several legislators also said they’d consider sponsoring a kindergarten bill, and California’s public school chief Tony Thurmond pledged to support any bill that addresses it.

Newsom’s final year as CA governor

This year marks Newsom’s last year as California’s governor. In this final year, how the governor responds to the state’s budget, housing and affordability issues could have a major effect on his expected bid for the presidency, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
In the past seven years, Newsom expanded transitional kindergarten, created an office to control rising health care costs and enacted policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. His policy and politics battles against the Trump administration, particularly in 2025, has also thrown Newsom into the national spotlight. 
But the governor has fallen short of some of his promises too, which he could continue to tackle in 2026: California housing costs are some of the highest in the nation and homelessness has increased under his tenure. Amid federal and state budget cuts, some advocates also worry that Newsom will walk away from his goal to expand health care coverage, such as when he proposed to freeze new Medi-Cal enrollments for undocumented immigrants.

That extends to Beacon Hill, where legislators have been more or less on a holiday break since mid-November and now need to chart a course for the busiest stretch of the two-year lawmaking term.
Representatives and senators tend to bristle at the suggestion that they have not been productive, and sure, 2025 featured a not-insignificant amount of work to survey the landscape, gather input, and ponder appropriate next steps.
But a quick glance at the term’s new laws so far shows that legislative leaders are far from accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Once the holiday decorations are taken down and stuffed back into storage, they’ll have plenty of work to do.
Here’s a look at what to expect from Beacon Hill in 2026.
Budget, budget, budget
After a bevy of spending last year — in fact, most of the substantial legislation approved in 2025 featured some degree of appropriations — policymakers will return to the topic quickly.
Healey must file an annual state budget proposal for fiscal year 2027 by January 28, which will kick off months of debate about how Massachusetts absorbs the impacts of federal policy changes.
Her deputies project the megalaw President Donald Trump signed in July will decrease tax collections by nearly $950 million across this year and next combined. Lawmakers might be tempted to soften the blow by divorcing parts of the state’s tax code from the federal code, though that strategy could draw pushback from businesses, for whom compliance would become a heavier lift.
The state’s financial outlook is middling, with most revenues set for modest growth, so budget-writers have their hands full even before accounting for the federal changes.
There’s another big variable hanging over the next cycle, too: influential business groups are pushing a ballot question that would slash the state’s income tax rate from 5 percent to 4 percent. If approved, experts say that measure could cut available revenues by hundreds of millions of dollars in fiscal 2027 and by up to $4.8 billion annually once fully implemented.
Top Democrats are already antsy about the measure, and the frustration could prompt discussions about a compromise policy change to keep the question off the ballot.
Still in crisis: Health care and housing
Three of last term’s biggest laws took aim at the lack of available, affordable places for Bay Staters to live, boosted oversight of hospitals, and sought to control prescription drug costs.
And that won’t be anywhere close to the final word on housing and health care.
Insiders expect more debate this year about what else Massachusetts can do to boost housing production and rein in prices. It’s not clear what lawmakers and Healey have in mind, but they regularly cite the issue as one of the most pressing in the state, especially given its importance to the overused “affordability” and “competitiveness” slogans.
On health care, there’s growing interest — at least in the Senate and corner office — in reinvigorating the primary care sector, where an aging workforce and a lack of new physicians entering the field make it difficult for patients to secure timely appointments.
A task force lawmakers created to come up with solutions last month recommended essentially doubling the share of health care dollars that flow toward primary care, without increasing total spending.
That’s a potentially impactful move that could trigger a major political battle: Growing one slice while keeping the pie the same size means other industry segments, like specialists and pharmaceuticals, would earn less. Those who stand to lose are unlikely to acquiesce quietly.

Finding the right balance on energy affordability
Many of Healey’s top legislative priorities are still stuck somewhere in the pipeline as the new year unfolds, but one already had a short-lived stretch in the spotlight.
The House last fall appeared poised to use Healey’s energy affordability bill as a vehicle to defang the state’s 2030 statutory decarbonization requirements. Once that idea generated major blowback from environmental advocates, though, House leaders retreated.
House Ways and Means Committee chair Aaron Michlewitz said in November that stakeholders still need to “have a conversation at some point related to whether we can meet our goals for 2030,” but suggested that probably will not happen as part of any action on the governor’s legislation.
Left unclear in that assessment was what the final House rewrite will look like, not to mention what senators will do once they get a chance to stamp their own mark on the bill.
Healey’s underlying package wove together a suite of reforms, such as allowing the Department of Public Utilities to cap monthly utility bill increases, more tightly regulate third-party competitive electric suppliers, clear the way for new nuclear power, and more. The governor projected it could save ratepayers $10 billion over a decade.
While that proposal idles, Bay Staters are buckling down for another winter with significant rate hikes.
Election season is closer than you think
No matter how much the Legislature does, 2026 could still be a record-breaking year for policymaking… at the ballot box.
As many as 12 ballot questions are poised to go before voters, barring any proposals failing to clear the remaining eligibility hurdles or campaigns pulling the plug. That would blow past the record of nine measures that appeared on the ballots in 1994, 1976, and 1972.
Expect an awful lot of bellyaching on Beacon Hill about the measures, most of which reflect attempts to circumvent the Legislature on policies that do not have enough support among legislative leaders to move.
The Legislature will get a chance in the first part of the year to approve any of the initiative petitions or propose substitutions, though it seems unlikely they’ll feel inclined to stamp support on this field. Elected officials on occasion have brokered deals in which some campaigns agree to halt their efforts, and that could be on the table again.
Another safe bet: A lot of people will spend, and make, a lot of money on electioneering.
Ballot question campaigns are almost always expensive endeavors, with the most politically potent topics leading to slugfests. Stretch that dynamic across a historically large field, and it seems likely that campaign finance regulators will track tens of millions of dollars changing hands.
This year is also a major statewide election for individual officeholders. All of the state’s constitutional officers are up for election again, and most — including Healey, Attorney General Andrea Campbell, and Treasurer Deborah Goldberg — have already announced plans to seek another term. Three Republicans are also aggressively jockeying for the chance to challenge Healey in the fall.
In the Legislature, there will be much less competition. History shows most Massachusetts lawmakers can expect an easy ride to reelection. But the Legislature as a whole still tends to operate with a fair degree of election-year logic, and the work accomplished by late summer will quickly become fodder for the few incumbents who need to break a sweat on the campaign trail.
Healey, too, will be eager for her Democratic compatriots to hand her some key legislative accomplishments to tout.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1800-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 08:57:15.547655

Under Newsom’s tenure, health care has been expanded, but his housing goals and homelessness pledges remain unfinished. Can he deliver before eyeing the White House?


It’s Gavin Newsom’s final year in office as California governor — and his last chance to use his role as governor to audition for the national stage. 
The governor, who will address the Legislature and present his budget proposal this week, has spent the past seven years pushing an ambitious agenda. Now in his final year, numerous interest groups will clamor for him to pass their preferred policies, nix the regulations they fear and protect the programs they favor. How he responds will follow him into his expected presidential primary run. 
Will he, with his recent focus on affordability, make a dent in Californians’ housing and health care costs? Will he make progress on reducing homelessness? Will he continue pushing green energy as voters demand cheaper gas? Will he weather another dismal budget deficit without punishing cuts that would alienate the progressives whose programs he has championed? 
“This really is a pivotal year for him,” Democratic political consultant Kelly Calkin said. “What do voters in the rest of the country want to see? They’re feeling the pinch of affordability. … He’s probably going to look through that lens on what helps shape his agenda for the next year.”
It’s also his final opportunity to make headway on some of the lofty goals Newsom made when he ran for governor in 2018 that he hasn’t always met.
He vowed to tackle homelessness, which has only gotten worse over his seven-year tenure, despite the more than $24 billion his administration has poured into it. He started off his term with an initial, headline-grabbing proposal to grant new parents six months of paid leave, but quickly pared it back to a two-week increase, for a total of eight weeks, and gradual boosts in how much the program pays.
In 2021 he said the state would add 200,000 new subsidized child care slots by this year, but the plan been delayed for two years and remains tens of thousand of slots short; he has since promised to resume the expansion this year.
He campaigned on establishing a single-payer public health care system, even calling out “politicians saying they support single-payer but that it’s too soon, too expensive or someone else’s problem.” Then he pivoted to “universal coverage,” with the state slowly expanding coverage for low-income Californians, including undocumented immigrants, but abruptly halted that amid a budget deficit last year. 
He spoke, like so many before him, of evening out the state’s boom-and-bust tax system that over-relies on stock market returns, but has largely quashed other proposals to raise revenue as the state stares down a deficit.
‘It never seems like enough’
Newsom’s penchant for big promises and first-in-the-nation ideas has been both a blessing and a curse for the ambitious politician. Advocates of those policies say the lofty goals have made a difference, even if the state ultimately falls short of achieving all of them. 
Newsom has left his mark on state government: He started new programs like the expansion of public school to all 4-year-olds, created an office to control rising health care costs, flexed the state’s regulatory powers to achieve its greenhouse gas-reduction goals — only to run into resistance with the Trump administration — and pushed state leaders into overseeing thorny issues like homelessness and the mental health care system that had long been left to local and county governments. 
“I don’t think there was a lot of stuff lacking,” said Anthony Rendon, the former Assembly speaker who led the chamber during Newsom’s first five years in office, of policy issues the governor has yet to address. After years of working with Newsom’s predecessor Jerry Brown, who was focused mostly on fiscal restraint and building up the state’s reserves, Rendon and former Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins recalled Newsom starting off his first term in 2019 pleasing the mostly Democratic Legislature with a long list of progressive ideas and a willingness to spend on them. 
“In retrospect, it never seems like enough,” Rendon said.

Case in point: housing. It’s perhaps the most visible measure by which Newsom will be judged after he leaves office and it comprises a bulk of the recent national Democratic platform focused on lowering the cost of living. About 40% of California households are “burdened” by their rent or mortgage, Census data shows, a policymaker benchmark meaning housing eats up more than a third of their income. 
Newsom ran on lowering those costs by boosting production and said it was “achievable” for the state to build an ambitious 3.5 million new homes by 2025. In 2024, the state added just under 120,000 new units, about a fifth of the annual rate needed to meet that goal. In media appearances the governor now downplays his original figure as a “stretch goal.”
Yet those who favor building more say he’s still accomplished more than any other governor on housing. They blame local resistance to housing density, high interest rates and the persistently high cost of building as reasons for the slow progress. 
“You can’t solve a systemic problem overnight or even in seven years, but what you can do is change the trajectory of the issue,” said Ray Pearl, executive director of the California Housing Consortium, a nonprofit that advocates for building affordable housing.
A pivot to modular housing this year?
Pearl pointed to actions Newsom has taken, like an early budget move to quintuple the state’s tax credit for low-income housing construction, backing laws that relax rules on where housing can be built and picking legal fights with cities that refuse to plan adequate housing units for their populations. 
“Leadership sets the tone,” he said. “It’s changed the focus and the conversation to where the state of California has finally gotten serious in planning for and producing affordable housing.”
Pearl said in Newsom’s final year in office he hopes the governor will support a proposed $10 billion bond lawmakers want to put on this year’s ballot to boost a state affordable housing fund.
Newsom acknowledges California has yet to see his promised building boom, and last month expressed interest in alternative forms of construction, such as modular housing, as another solution. On The Ezra Klein Show, he hinted at an upcoming legislative debate over how the state can promote modular housing, a cheaper way to build in which houses are assembled in factories then shipped to sites to be installed. An Assembly committee chaired by one of Newsom’s allies on housing, Democratic Oakland Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, is set to discuss the method this year. Its use in the Bay Area has already exposed familiar debates about the use of union labor in housing. 
“This holds a lot of promise. It holds a lot of political peril, in the context of the politics within labor. And that has to be accommodated and dealt with,” Newsom said. “By the way, if there’s a big preview for California in my last year, it’s in this space legislatively to take it to the next level.”
It’s the closest Newsom has come in recent weeks to stating a new policy goal or proposal. Izzy Gardon, Newsom’s spokesperson, would not provide any details on his housing or any other agenda, telling CalMatters only to “stay tuned.” 
Gardon refused interview requests to discuss the governor’s policy goals for his final year. Newsom is expected to deliver his State of the State address on Thursday.
Tough times for health care and social services
Already, advocates for the comprehensive safety-net services that Newsom has championed — another hallmark of his tenure — are urging him to maintain those programs as he stares down another tough budget deficit estimated at $18 billion. The agency overseeing those services accounts for nearly 40% of the state’s general fund spending and many of its programs are projected to lose significant federal funds through President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill.

During Newsom’s two terms, he added subsidized child care slots, boosted cash assistance for the poor, installed a state surgeon general who has focused on childhood trauma and the racial health gap and most significantly, incrementally expanded health care coverage to different groups of undocumented immigrants. 
The latter, a controversial and costly policy, has allowed the governor to pivot from his original promise of a universal, state-paid health care system that was the pie-in-the-sky dream of progressives and still say he was achieving “universal access.” After passage of the Affordable Care Act, more than 90% of Californians were insured by the time Newsom took office. His expansions, first for immigrant young adults and then for older ones, pushed it to nearly everyone in 2023. 
Policy allies generally don’t fault Newsom for shifting away from a single-payer system, which would have required billions more in state funds and complex agreements with an increasingly un-aligned federal administration. They are particularly satisfied that his administration has laid some of the groundwork for such a proposal by attempting to rein in the growth of health care costs through price limits imposed by the Office of Health Care Affordability. But now, they’re worried he’ll walk away from his expansive coverage goals altogether. 
Last year, facing higher than expected costs in the Medi-Cal program and needing to close a $12 billion deficit, Newsom undid coverage for the last group of undocumented residents to become eligible: working-age adults. A freeze on new enrollment of adults took effect Jan. 1. Later this year, undocumented immigrant adults will lose Medi-Cal dental coverage and next year most will face monthly premiums that are expected to force some off coverage, to the disappointment of health advocates who are urging Newsom to reverse the cuts. 
Amanda McAllister-Wallner, executive director of the advocacy group Health Access California, said she’s worried the administration will consider further cuts this year, after Newsom has come out heavily against other proposals to raise revenue for the health system, like a nurses’ union proposal for a wealth tax. She doesn’t like that the governor appeared willing to back down on coverage at the same time the state’s provision of social services for immigrants became an increasing political controversy nationally. 
“The hope was that the Health for All expansion would be considered the baseline, that that would be something we budget for long term because it’s just something that’s part of who we are as a state,” said McAllister-Wallner. “Health care has been an area where the governor has really made a name for himself in a way that I think he can and should be very proud of, and to see … a backing-off of those commitments would be the biggest disappointment for me.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/010623-Newsom-Inauguration-RL-CM-06.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 08:57:15.547655

California is one of 32 states that doesn’t require 5-year-olds to attend school.



The past few years, California has been all about the ABCs, 1-2-3s and the wheels on the bus, investing more than $5 billion in early childhood education. 
But kindergarten, a staple of elementary schools for more than a century, remains optional. Despite nearly a half dozen legislative attempts to require it, California is one of 32 states that doesn’t mandate that all 5-year-olds attend school.
That might change next year. Legislators plan to introduce a new bill to require kindergarten and they’re confident that it will meet a better fate than its predecessors, which either died in committee or were vetoed, largely due to the cost.
“Kids need to be around other kids, they need to be learning. It matters,” said Patricia Lozano, executive director of Early Edge California, which advocates for early childhood education. “I don’t see why California can’t make this happen.”
The data, advocates say, is clear. Children who attend kindergarten have higher test scores in math and reading in third grade and beyond and higher high school graduation rates. They’re also less likely to be suspended or drop out later in their school careers.
Why some parents opt out
While California requires all school districts to offer kindergarten, it doesn’t require families to enroll their children. Most do, but about 5% a year opt out. The reasons vary: some families believe their children aren’t ready for the rigors of school, and others are happy with their children’s current arrangement, whether it’s a preschool, day care or staying home with family.
Latino families are the least likely to send their children to kindergarten, data shows. Lozano said there’s a variety of reasons for this: they either don’t know about it due to a language barrier; they’re afraid to register their children in school due to immigration concerns; parents are working so hard they’ve missed notices from the school district; or some combination of all three. Regardless, schools need to improve their outreach to that community, she said.
Cecelia Kiss, a bilingual kindergarten teacher in the Sacramento City Unified School District, said she recently had a student whose mother was deported, and the child was unable to attend school because there was no one available to drive her. Even though the child loved school and the family placed a high value on education, it was logistically impossible to get the child to school. It took several weeks for the school and family to make transportation arrangements.
“For Latinos, education is so important. We want to give our kids the best we can,” said Kiss, who is also the parent of a kindergartner. “But sometimes we can’t do everything. We rely on kind teachers to care for our children, to help them learn, to help them be prepared for first grade.”
State Sen. Susan Rubio said that the fact that kindergarten isn’t mandatory discourages already disadvantaged families from enrolling their children. In her experience, Latino families have tremendous respect for the public school system and if the system tells them kindergarten is optional, and therefore not a priority, “they listen to that.”
That’s why she’s proposed two previous bills to make kindergarten mandatory. The state should be unequivocal in its message to families that early childhood education is essential for students’ success in school and life, she said. The state’s already rolled out transitional kindergarten to all 4-year-olds, expanded state-funded preschool and added more slots to its subsidized child care program. Bolstering kindergarten should be next, she said.
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond agrees. He said this month that making kindergarten mandatory is a legislative priority for 2026, and he pledged to support any bill that addresses it. Several legislators said they’d consider sponsoring one.
‘Not an urgent need’
Both of Rubio’s previous kindergarten bills died – one in the Senate Appropriations Committee and another when Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed it. In his veto note, he said he supports early education generally but the state hadn’t budgeted the cost, estimated to be $268 million annually. 
“While the author’s intent is laudable … it is important to remain disciplined when it comes to spending, particularly spending that is ongoing,” Newsom wrote.
Plenty of groups supported the bills, including the California Teachers Association — the state’s largest teachers union — and a slew of school districts. But it had a few opponents, namely the Homeschool Association of California. The group’s opposition was not based on the merits of kindergarten itself, but on the state’s ability to strip rights from parents.
“Most kids are already going to kindergarten. But some parents have good reasons for keeping their kids at home,” said Jamie Heston, a member of the group’s board. “Parents want the choice to decide what’s best for their individual child.”
The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association hasn’t taken a position on the issue, but generally opposes new initiatives that cost money — including mandatory kindergarten. That stance isn’t likely to change if a kindergarten bill resurfaces, the group’s vice president Susan Shelley said this week.
“From a budgetary point of view, there’s a lot of pressure this year to keep spending under control,” Shelley said. “This would not be a one-time cost. It would be ongoing. And there’s not an urgent need to expand kindergarten, compared to other more pressing needs facing the state right now.”
Bruce Fuller, an education professor at UC Berkeley who studies early childhood education, said the Legislature should focus on more pressing needs facing the under-6 crowd. Those include how the rollout of transitional kindergarten has led to the closure of many preschools, leaving many 3-year-olds without a place to go. Also, Head Start is struggling with funding and other obstacles imposed by the Trump administration, including attempts to bar families who are not citizens. And even though California has expanded access to state-funded preschool, not enough families know they’re eligible.
“Not that many families opt out of kindergarten, so it’s not a huge need,” Fuller said. “There are more immediate concerns.” 
Learning gaps among students
Still, Rubio is confident that a kindergarten bill has a good chance of passing this year, largely because the Legislature has seen a significant turnover since it last voted on a  kindergarten bill in 2024. Twenty-seven new senators and Assembly members were elected last fall.
For Rubio, whose parents immigrated from Mexico, the issue is personal. Although she did well in school, her twin brother did not. At an early age, he was wrongly placed in special education, fell behind and struggled throughout his time in school, eventually dropping out. Rubio believes he would have fared better if he had a high-quality early childhood education.
She’s also an elementary school teacher who’s seen the gap between students who’ve been to preschool, TK and kindergarten, versus those who had never enrolled in school at all until first grade. Children who’ve been to kindergarten know how to hold a pencil, write their names, count to 20, take turns and maybe even read or do basic math, she said. Those who haven’t lag far behind their peers and some never catch up, she said.
“I have very vivid memories of my students just breaking down crying at the end of the year because they couldn’t do a test. They didn’t know the answers, and that’s so heartbreaking to see,” said Rubio, who’s on leave from her job teaching at Monrovia Unified in Los Angeles County. “It’s hard on them, and it’s hard on the teachers because those children need a lot of extra help.”
Lozano said she thinks the bill will pass eventually. The initiative would cost money, but the state would save money in the long run if more students succeeded in school and graduated.
“It took us 20 years to get TK. It takes time to change minds, change policies,” Lozano said. “There are so many benefits to kindergarten, especially for the kids who need it the most. We believe the benefits outweigh the costs.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/032723-Buttonwillow-LV_CM_15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 08:57:15.547655

The California Courier uses the name of an established paper and doesn’t disclose apparent Republican ties. Critics call it “pink slime”




Earlier this year, as the political battle over Congressional redistricting brought California into the national spotlight, Facebook users were shown a curious series of ads.
The ads, from a straightforward-looking news site called the California Courier, often felt a lot like campaign commercials, linking to articles hammering Democrats in the state, including Gov. Gavin Newsom. Few punched in the other direction, toward Republicans. One said “California Democrats just rewrote their gerrymandering plan so voters will see their partisan map on the ballot this November.” Another called Proposition 50, which passed in November, “a scheme critics say is meant to undermine voter-approved protections and entrench one party rule in California.”
A reader who clicked through to the Courier’s website would find stories that largely align with a conservative view of the news, like a video of a child “riding a scooter through San Fran’s drug-ravaged streets,” or an anonymous piece that cites “confidential sources” cautioning against a “left-wing educator” running for a position with an Orange County school district. 
What a reader would not find is any disclosure of the Courier’s ownership or funding, including what appear to be ties to a network of conservative organizations in California that, according to one researcher, scaled up a series of right-leaning news sites in three other states just ahead of the 2024 election.
The Courier has money to spend. According to a review of the ad library maintained by Facebook’s owner, Meta, the outlet has spent more than $80,000 since 2021 promoting its stories on social issues and politics, potentially reaching tens of thousands of users on the platform each week. 
Critics say the California outlet is part of a growing, nationwide ecosystem of innocuous-looking, cheaply-produced news publications that publish and advertise biased articles in an attempt to surreptitiously influence elections. They worry the practice could mislead voters and corrode trust in nonpartisan news providers.  
“I think we are in an era where people are consuming so much content online without knowing the source of it,” said Max Read, who has studied the network apparently behind the Courier at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonprofit that works to counter political polarization. “And for well-funded organizations to contribute to that by disguising what they’re doing online just helps exacerbate that problem of people not trusting what they come across.”

At a glance, the Courier does not necessarily look right-leaning. A handful of stories seem like straight news echoing press releases, such as one announcing new affordable housing units. But even those that seem relatively neutral may have a right-leaning spin, like one describing speeding fines tied to income as a potential “woke penalty loophole.”
The outlet also shares a name with a 67-year-old California-based publication serving the Armenian diaspora. One of that Courier’s founders won acclaim from his peers for his tenure as dean of the University of Maryland’s journalism school.
When The Markup and CalMatters contacted the publisher of the Armenian Courier, he said he was unaware of the other site. He told a reporter he was opening it for the first time.
“I’m definitely not conservative,” said Harut Sassounian, who owns the Courier, where his regular editorials appear online and formerly in print. “The two publications have nothing in common. Neither politically nor ethnically nor anything like that.”
The Lincoln Media network
Although it lacks the pedigree of its Armenian twin, the right-leaning Courier has shown it is well-immersed in today’s social media. A video it made suggesting Newsom flip-flopped in his view of President Joe Biden’s mental acuity generated thousands of reactions. 
The publication also shares some of the murky citation practices of contemporary social media. Almost all of the stories on the site are unattributed, or simply attributed to “the California Courier.” 
A few, however, include author names. One of the named writers describes himself on social media as a “content creator” for the Lincoln Media Foundation, a conservative group, and links to Courier articles. Another shares a name with a Republican strategist based in Orange County, and a third lists a resume with conservative organizations in a short bio. 
The Lincoln Media Foundation is tied to the Lincoln Club, a group based in Orange County that bills itself as “the oldest and largest conservative major donor organization in the state of California.” The club funnels anonymously-donated money to conservative candidates and causes.
The Lincoln Media Foundation’s Facebook page recently said it was “proud to present” a new documentary purporting to reveal “the untold truth about the Pacific Palisades fire,” the natural disaster that tore through the state this year and increased political pressure on Newsom. 
One hour later, the Courier’s Facebook page promoted it as well, not mentioning the Lincoln Media Foundation but describing the documentary as “much anticipated.”

Neither the Lincoln Club, Lincoln Media, the California Courier, or the Courier writers responded to multiple requests for comment about the origins of the site, either through email, phone, or social media messages.
That silence, and the lack of information about ownership on the Courier’s website, comes despite the outlet’s chief goal, as outlined on its Facebook page.
“California Courier offers statewide and local news,” the page’s description reads. “Our mission is transparency.”
The Lincoln Club has previously been linked to “local” websites around the country, spreading stories with a distinctly conservative tint. 
Last year, Read’s Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which tracks disinformation and extremism online, found a handful of such sites that noted deep in their privacy policies that they were projects from Lincoln Media. Those outlets had names like The Angeleno and the Keystone Courier, and stretched from California to Pennsylvania, although a resulting report didn’t name the Courier. 
Many of the sites used Facebook and other social media tools to press a conservative agenda, the report found. Meta has rules against “coordinated inauthentic behavior” but it’s not clear whether Lincoln Media’s websites would cross that line. 
‘Pink slime’ news
Researchers have taken to calling sites like those operated by Lincoln Media “pink slime” news, a name coined after a meat-industry additive. These sites don’t produce outright false news, like others, but they do not meet basic journalistic standards. That often means low-quality content and failing to disclose associations with outside organizations. 
The sites generally aren’t designed to generate revenue, but to sway public opinion. The majority, according to researchers, lean toward a conservative agenda, and if the site’s stories gain traction on social media, they can travel widely. “If they place an ad well or if they just get the right pickup from the right influencer, these things don’t really have a limit on how far they can go,” Read said.
While it’s not clear how many sites the Lincoln Club might fund, it isn’t the only group that has used the strategy.
In 2020, the New York Times reported on Metric Media, a group that created nearly 1,300 sites around the country with names like Maine Business Daily and the Ann Arbor Times. At a glance, these could pass for simple local news operations. But the Times report found they took money from public relations firms and Republican operatives to produce stories beneficial to those groups, a massive journalistic red flag. 
Ethical or not, the strategy can be effective for lending credibility to a particular viewpoint. Kevin DeLuca, an assistant professor of political science at Yale University who has researched pink slime websites, conducted an experiment that showed subjects both real unbiased news sites and others produced by Metric Media. 
Some subjects in the study were given a tip sheet that asked them to examine the sites closely, looking at whether they included information like credible mission pages and other details. But even with the tip sheet, the study subjects said in interviews that they didn’t strongly prefer the truly local over the manufactured sites. 
DeLuca says these sites are now in place around the United States, and news consumers have little idea when they’re running into them. The problem may only get worse with the spread of generative AI, since that technology further reduces the cost of creating such sites.
Researchers who study these sites say it’s never been easier to produce them. Local news, for one, has faced a years-long financial crisis that’s wiped many once-robust operations off the map.

While it can’t be said whether any one publication uses AI-generated content, the wide availability of tools like ChatGPT, capable of producing at least a semblance of a passable news story, have also made it easier to build up such sites. 
“It’s going to make these pink slime sites even harder for people to know that what they’re reading is not from a human source and not really local investigative journalism.” DeLuca said.
Sassounian, for his part, doesn’t think there’s any risk the two California Couriers would ever be confused with each other. He took over the paper in the 1980s, and his columns, which he describes as “hard-hitting editorials that defend the rights of the Armenian people worldwide,” have been translated into languages around the world. 
“It’s not pleasant to have our name used by someone else,” Sassounian said. “I prefer that they don’t, but I don’t know what I can do about it.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/121125-CA-COURIER-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-05 08:57:15.547655

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As states across the nation broke into a redistricting arms race ahead of the 2026 elections, Utah got a new congressional map through a court-ordered redistricting process stemming from a yearslong lawsuit alleging gerrymandering and a violation of Utahns’ rights to reform their government through ballot initiative. 
By the end of 2025, a Utah judge had ordered a new congressional map that included one Democratic-leaning district. 
The ruling has left Republican lawmakers dismayed and defiant. They’ve accused the judge of violating the Utah Constitution and separation of powers principles, as they maintain the Legislature has the sole authority to draw political boundaries. They’ve pledged to continue to fight the ruling in court and have pushed back candidate filing deadlines to allow more time for a different map to be put in place. 
As Supreme Court pulls back on gerrymandering, state courts may decide fate of maps

Anti-gerrymandering groups and plaintiffs in the case, meanwhile, are standing firm, arguing that the courts have not only the power — but the responsibility — to step in when lawmakers have failed to pass a lawful map. 
Voters in 2018 narrowly approved a ballot measure known as Proposition 4, which created an independent redistricting commission that had to adhere to neutral map-drawing criteria. But lawmakers later repealed and replaced that law with a new one to turn the independent commission into an advisory body that lawmakers ultimately didn’t need to listen to. 
Though 2025 brought significant developments in Utah’s longstanding redistricting legal fight, it’s still far from being resolved. 
Here are the key issues to watch in 2026 — which will have crucial implications for Utah’s redistricting process, the fate of Utahns’ ballot initiative power, and the future of Utah’s political landscape.

Will Utah’s court-ordered congressional map hold? 
The lawsuit over Utah’s redistricting process is far from over. 
The Utah Legislature’s top Republican leaders have repeatedly said they plan to appeal 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s rulings to the Utah Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. 
Late last month, Gibson issued a ruling declining to finalize the larger, ongoing redistricting lawsuit but allowing final certification of her Aug. 25 ruling that tossed out the Legislature’s 2021 map. That means the Legislature can appeal that specific decision to the Utah Supreme Court, which it’s expected to do in early January.

In that ruling, Gibson acknowledged that “until there is a final decision on these legal issues from our Supreme Court, there will be a cloud (over) Utah’s congressional elections and an open question regarding the power of the Legislature and the power of the people.” 
“The Utah Supreme Court can decide now if the Legislature is the sole and exclusive authority over redistricting in Utah or if it shares that responsibility with the people,” Gibson wrote. “It can decide if the people of Utah, through the exercise of their right to alter or reform government through a citizen initiative, can also pass binding laws regarding how the Legislature performs its redistricting duty.”
Additionally, the judge said the Utah Supreme Court “should decide now” if her Aug. 25 ruling that blocked the Legislature’s 2021 congressional map should stand or not. 
“These legal questions should be put to rest as soon as possible,” she wrote. “There is no just reason to delay the Utah Supreme Court’s review of those legal rulings in the (Aug. 25 ruling).” 
In redistricting fight, Utah Republican lawmakers will appeal to Utah Supreme Court

Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. 
Lawmakers in a special session pushed back the 2026 congressional candidate filing period by about two months — until March 9-13 — in hopes of getting a different congressional map in place in time for the 2026 elections. But it remains unclear whether the Utah Supreme Court will weigh in on time, what its decision will be — or if lawmakers will attempt any other legislative maneuvers between now and then. 
For now, though, Utah’s court-ordered map that includes a Democratic-leaning district concentrated in northern Salt Lake County, remains.
Democrats’ crowded race for Congress 
With high hopes that Utah Democrats will have their best chance in years to send a candidate to the U.S. House, the Democratic primary for the state’s newly drawn 1st Congressional District is already shaping up to be a crowded one. 
State Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, was the first to announce, followed closely by former congressman Ben McAdams, the last Utah Democrat to hold a seat in Congress. Former state Sen. Derek Kitchen also jumped into the race, along with current Sen. Nate Blouin, Salt Lake City Council member Eva Lopez Chavez, and a newcomer from West Valley City, Luis Villarreal. Even more announcements could be in the works. 
Meanwhile, the new District 1 could force a shakeup in Utah’s current all-Republican delegation. 
Utah lawmakers condemn courts while anti-gerrymandering supporters urge ‘hear our voice’

Because congressional candidates don’t need to live in the district they represent, it’s not yet clear which district each incumbent will run for. But if Utah’s current court-ordered map holds, whichever Republican runs for the 1st Congressional District will likely face an uphill battle to keep his or her seat. 
Will Republicans’ effort to repeal Prop 4 succeed? 
While Utah’s redistricting court battle continues, the Utah Republican Party and a political issues committee called Utahns for Representative Government are pursuing a ballot initiative of their own to repeal the voter-approved independent redistricting law known as Proposition 4. 
To successfully place the repeal question on the 2026 ballot, the groups have until Feb. 14 to gather at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters and hit high enough thresholds in at least 26 out of the state’s 29 Senate districts. 
As of Dec. 31, 24,372 signatures had been submitted, according to the Lieutenant Governor’s Office.
Another redistricting twist: Utah GOP changes tactics to repeal independent map-drawing law

A dark money group that helped finance President Donald Trump presidential campaign in 2024 is bankrolling the Proposition 4 repeal effort. The nonprofit Securing American Greatness has contributed more than $4.3 million to Utahns for Representative Government, according to the group’s received contributions report. 
The anti-gerrymandering group Better Boundaries — which successfully sought Proposition 4 in 2018 — has been encouraging Utahns not to sign the repeal petition, while also accusing some paid signature gatherers of using “misleading and deceptive tactics to trick people into signing.” The group has also issued reminders that signers can go through a process to remove their signatures. 
If the groups successfully place the repeal question on the 2026 ballot, Utah voters will have the final say on whether Proposition 4 stays — or gets overturned. 
Lawmakers may try again to enshrine their power over ballot initiatives 
When Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders announced they would be holding a special session to push back congressional candidate filing deadlines, they also said they plan to consider asking voters to consider a constitutional amendment to “clarify” or restrict the power of voter-approved ballot initiatives. 
It wouldn’t be the first time Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature tried to do this — but the last attempt failed, voided by the courts. 
After a groundbreaking Utah Supreme Court ruling in 2024 made clear that the Legislature’s power over “government reform” ballot initiatives has limits, Utah lawmakers put a question known as Amendment D on the 2024 November ballot to sidestep that ruling and rewrite the Utah Constitution. 
Judge voids controversial constitutional amendment on Utah’s Nov. 5 ballot

Had it been approved by voters, Amendment D would have enshrined in the Utah Constitution the Legislature’s unfettered power to repeal or alter any type of ballot initiative, including Proposition 4. 
However, the Nov. 5 ballot language posing the question to voters — written by Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders — did not explain that in plain language, prompting critics to sue. They claimed Amendment D’s language was “false and misleading.”
Gibson agreed, while also determining state officials failed to meet constitutional publication requirements — so she voided the question. State attorneys appealed the decision to the Utah Supreme Court, which affirmed the district court’s decision.
But Utah lawmakers don’t seem likely to drop the issue. They may pursue a new version of Amendment D — but it’s not yet clear what its language will be. Lawmakers are likely to consider a resolution to put the question on the ballot during their 2026 general session scheduled to begin Jan. 20. 
Lawmakers eye changes to the courts 
As part of a brewing issue that’s related to redistricting but bigger — stemming from lawmakers’ overall recent frustrations with the court system — Utah legislators are likely to again turn their attention to Utah’s judiciary and consider making changes. 
Utah’s top GOP lawmakers have said that the Legislature is expected to weigh whether to expand Utah’s Supreme Court from five justices to seven. 
They told the Deseret News it’s meant to address growing caseloads and to speed up decisions, but Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told The Salt Lake Tribune in October that more justice could actually lead to more deliberation and delay timelines further. 
Saying it’s not court packing, governor supports expanding Utah’s appeals courts  

Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters during his Nov. 25 news conference broadcast by PBS Utah that he’s in favor of adding more justices to the Utah Supreme Court and more judges to the state’s Court of Appeals. 
The governor said he doesn’t see it as court packing, and that he doesn’t share the same consternation lawmakers have with the courts. Rather, he said he sees it as a way to “start moving justice quicker through the system.”
A majority of states have at least seven justices. That includes neighboring Colorado and Nevada. Idaho and Wyoming have five. 
If the Utah Legislature’s 2026 session is anything like last year’s, however, it’s possible tensions between lawmakers and the judiciary could boil over again. Last year, lawmakers considered a slate of bills that legal professionals and even Durrant, who as a member of the high court doesn’t generally comment on political issues, described as a “broad attack on the independence of the judiciary.” 
Many of those bills, however, fizzled or resulted in a compromise. It’s possible some could return for further debate. 
Additionally, some Republican lawmakers have voiced support for considering articles of impeachment against Gibson over her rulings in the redistricting case — but it remains to be seen whether that effort will gain any traction. 
Rep. Matt MacPherson, R-West Valley City, said he planned to file articles of impeachment against the judge. But when asked about that effort in November, MacPherson told Utah News Dispatch he wanted to wait and see how the Legislature’s appeal to the Utah Supreme Court goes before deciding whether to proceed.

Jeana Ross, R-Guntersville, speaks to the Alabama House of Representatives on May 8, 2024 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker has pre-filed a bill for the 2026 legislative session that would limit screen time for children.
HB 78, sponsored by Jeana Ross, R-Guntersville, would require licensed child-care facilities, public kindergarten classrooms and certain Pre-K classrooms to implement guidelines and training on screen time created by the Department of Early Childhood Education (ADECE) Research and Evaluation team.
Ross, who previously served as Alabama Secretary of Early Childhood Education, said after seeing what research said about the effects of screen time on children wanted to find a way to prevent it.

“I can remember early on, like in the early 2000s writing grants, because I wanted every child to have an iPad. I just thought, because it was the new technology, and they could put all their books on the iPad, and they wouldn’t have to carry those heavy books in a backpack,” she said in a recent interview. “I didn’t know better, but now we see what the outcomes are and why it wasn’t such a bad idea for the older students, but it absolutely was not a good idea for the younger students.”
An August report from Cedars-Sinai Medical Medical Center, a hospital in Los Angeles, said that children under three years old should have “little to no screen exposure” because it can delay social skill development.
“We’ve long recognized that the earliest years of life matter the most, and from birth to age five, their children’s brains are developing so fast, I mean, faster than any other time, and the experiences they have during those years shapes their learning for a lifetime,” Ross said.
Ross said one key piece of this bill is bringing awareness to parents about screen usage.
“This is not about shaming or making people feel like, oh my goodness, what have I done? This is just about informing, and that’s going to be a big piece of this legislation, that parents are going to be able to have information that they might not have known about, as far as how to best use screens and when not to use them,” she said.
Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey said after the Dec. 11 Alabama State Board of Education meeting that while screens have their place in society, students need to be spending instructional time with teachers.
“There’s a lot of research about the overuse of screens in some places. We already have limitations on our four-year-old Pre-K program in this state, so I’m excited about us having discussions about how we can extend some of those limits to five-year-olds,” he said.
Under the Alabama Administrative Code, children under the age of two are prohibited from screen usage and children over the age of two are limited to less than 30 minutes per day for children in half-day programs and less than an hour a day in full-day programs in licensed childcare facilities.
Not all child care facilities in Alabama are licensed. Out of 2,458 facilities roughly 78% (1,922) are licensed by the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR). Licensed facilities are required to reapply for licensure every two years.
Ross’ bill expands these limitations to include weekly limitations of 90 minutes per day for children ages two through four and individual screen usage is prohibited. Local boards of education must adopt policies on appropriate screen time usage in kindergarten classrooms.
Guidelines implemented in the bill would be created by the Department of Early Childhood Education (ADECE) Research and Evaluation team in collaboration with DHR and the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE). All three agencies will implement the guidelines once created.
“If you provide the opportunity to people, for people to have input, not only are you creating something that’s got a lot of good across the board perspective, you’re including people in the process, and I think that’s very important,” Ross said.
The guidelines must include the importance of reading, play, physical activity and caregiver-child interaction; the risks of excessive screen time on children and strategies for creating “screen-free routines” at home.
The bill would require certain teachers and staff to undergo annual training developed by ADECE, DHR AND ALSDE that includes guidance on the appropriate use of screen time in early childhood settings, what constitutes high-quality programming and alternatives to screen time.
Mackey said he believes Legislature will spend a considerable amount of time discussing the bill when they begin meeting on Jan. 13.
“I know the governor is very interested in this and we’re having a lot of conversations about it,” he said. “I think something will come of it and there’ll be some limitations by the end of the spring.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jeana-Ross-May-8-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 08:11:41.157980

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Tribes across the West have worked with states to protect the Colorado River and conserve enough water to raise elevations in the river’s two largest reservoirs, Lakes Powell and Mead, a move that has helped states during critical droughts.
Now tribes want to make it clear that any future agreements on how to manage the river’s water must include their input and an acknowledgment that they intend to develop their water rights.
“It’s high time that tribes begin to really begin to flex their sovereignty,” said Mike Natchees, a member of the Ute Indian Tribe Business Committee.
The Ute Indian Tribe holds significant senior water rights, including 500,000 acre-feet in the Green River basin in Utah, but faces challenges with unused water flowing downstream due to lack of infrastructure and funding. 
“It just continues to flow downstream. We are uncompensated for it. It is undeveloped. And again, that is unacceptable for the Ute Indian Tribe,” Natchees said.
That sentiment was shared among representatives for dozens of tribes who spoke at the Colorado River Water Users Association conference at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in December.
Western states that rely on the Colorado River have less than two months to agree on how to manage the troubled river. The seven Colorado River Basin states — Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming — have until Feb. 14 to reach a new water sharing agreement before current operating rules expire at the end of 2026 —or the federal government will step in with their own plan.
But the Ute Indian Tribe, whose reservation is located in Northeastern Utah, emphasized that any new agreement will have a significant impact on tribes across the Colorado River basin.
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use during dry years. Historically, Lower Basin states have used nearly all their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation under current Colorado River guidelines, compared to the 4.5 million acres-feet used by the Upper Basin states.
Natchees said the impact of water cuts to tribes in the Upper Basin have not been discussed enough during negotiations, adding that he hopes tribes will one day have a seat on the Upper Colorado River Commission, an interstate water administrative agency that represents Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico.
“The bottom line is that the Lower Basin is just simply over allocated. They’re overusing and they’re doing it with no regard to anyone in the Upper Basin, which feeds their system, and that needs to change,” Natchees said.
Tribes have continued to be a part of the solution when it comes to conservation on the river, said President of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, Jonathan E. Koteen.
In 2025, the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe signed an agreement to conserve 13,000 acre-feet of water to bolster elevations in Lake Mead, and contributed additional water savings through its ongoing seasonal fallowing agreement with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
Those water savings helped California reach its goal of conserving 1.6 million acre-feet in Lake Mead a year ahead of schedule.
“Tribal inclusion must be formal, meaningful and permanent. Tribes are not new participants. We are original stewards of the river, and our voices must be part of shaping the future family,” Koteen said.
Conservation efforts by tribes have also been innovative, said Koteen. The Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe secured funding to line the Reservation Main Canal, reducing seepage and improving efficiency for water deliveries to large portions of the Yuma Project Reservation Division.
Another example of an innovative solution was when the Jicarilla Apache Nation entered a landmark 10-year water-sharing agreement with New Mexico and The Nature Conservancy in 2023 to lease up to 20,000 acre-feet of its Colorado River water annually, supporting endangered fish habitat and water security for the state by strategically releasing water into the San Juan River.
“It’s increasing water security for the state of New Mexico, allowing the state to meet its obligations under whatever framework that we end up coming up with in post 2026, so it’s a great project,” said Jenny Dumas, the water attorney for the Jicarilla Apache Nation.
But Dumas emphasized that not every tribe can replicate such an agreement, and every tribe has their own unique needs that must be considered when settling on a new water sharing agreement.
Councilmember for Ute Mountain Ute Tribe Conrad Jacket said the tribe’s Bow and Arrow Farm is a major economic driver. While tribes in California, like the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, are able to reduce crops for payment, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe can not.
“This year, we did have to cut back,” Jacket said. “And that’s not good on our part. That is not good on all this whole region’s part.”
Instead, the tribe would benefit more from flexible tools that allow the tribe’s water to be set aside in good water years, while contributing to additional release in dry years.
Tribes said they were committed to helping states reach a seven-state consensus on how to share the river’s water, in order to stabilize the river and secure their rights.

The lieutenant governor presides over the Alabama Senate but has little power over the chamber. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)The Alabama lieutenant governor, constitutionally speaking, is like a bag of old phone charging cords.
You may need it one day. But it’s more likely to sit and do nothing.
Which is not to say the person occupying the office is powerless. The lieutenant governor has some appointments. He or she presides over the Senate and casts votes in the event of a deadlock. And should the governor leave office — legally or mortally — the lieutenant governor takes the job.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But for most occupants, it’s four or eight years of doing little but calling senators to order and reporting the outcome of votes.
The lieutenant governor, in effect, is a timekeeper with benefits. You could become governor. But you most likely won’t. It’s the vestigial tail of Alabama government.
Yet promising to sit better than your opponents doesn’t fly in a political campaign. So candidates for the office have to pretend its limitations don’t exist, or campaign on their personalities.
I’ll give Wes Allen this much: His campaign website for lieutenant governor seemingly acknowledges that fact. It has no issues section or platform. It’s just Allen and his far-right ideas, particularly when it comes to voting.
It’s the same thing with Agriculture and Industries Commissioner Rick Pate, another candidate for the office. The only suggestion policy on his site is a link to a story in which Pate says Trump’s tariffs on agriculture, which are terrible for farmers, are actually good for them.
There are other candidates with plans for the job. Patrick Bishop wants to “vigorously advocate for the equality of all Americans” (could be a tough sell in the Alabama GOP these days). Dean Odle has a lengthy article on his website about an alliance between Islam and communism (which probably would have used “Catholicism” in the place of “Islam” not too long ago). Nicole Wadsworth has a detailed issues page, but hardly anything on it is in the purview of the office she seeks.
Phillip Ensler, so far the sole Democratic candidate, says he would try to facilitate healthy debate in the chamber, in hopes of advancing legislation on issues like education and health care. He can do everything on the former, but it’s hard to see what effect he could have on the latter in a GOP-dominated Senate.
This will be a pattern over the next few months. Among Republicans, you’re going to see a lot of arguments over who loves President Donald Trump more and can act as the oracle of his will. They’re going to want you to think that they can remake education and the economy while asking the clerk to call the roll in the Senate.
And we’re going to see a lot of money spent on this timekeeping job. In 2018, the candidates for the office spent over $5 million on the race. Combined, Allen and Pate raised $1.3 million for the lieutenant governor contest by the end of November.
The lieutenant governor’s race, in that respect, is an estuary where the fresh water of political ambition meets the brackish waves of constitutional reality.
But it also reflects a broader disconnect between campaigning and governing in this state. Which we’re going to see a lot of in these midterm elections.
Tommy Tuberville’s gubernatorial campaign website leads with his promise to fight “woke ideology.” In Alabama, this has meant making teachers afraid to discuss Black history with students and having publicly subsidized come-aparts over rainbow flags.  He also wants to bring back manufacturing jobs, secure the border that’s some 675 miles away from Alabama, and improve education, somehow.
The thing, though, is that Tuberville won’t have the power to do any of that should he be elected governor. He’ll have a bully pulpit — emphasis on bully — for his obsessions. But Tuberville will learn, as other governors have, that power in the state resides in the Legislature.
But he’s not the only candidate who doesn’t seem up to speed on the state of things in Alabama. Jay Mitchell and Katherine Robertson’s attorney general campaigns leave one with the impression that A) Alabama’s immigration rates are high (they are lower than the national average), B) that immigration is inherently a problem and C) that Immigration and Customs Enforcement somehow needs their help to terrorize children and families.
Over in the secretary of state’s race — a campaign for an office that does little more than file papers — Caroleene Dobson and Andrew Sorrell want you to think election fraud, effectively nonexistent in Alabama, is a much bigger issue than election accessibility.
It’s this strange game we play. Candidates pick issues that have little valence in the state. Voters more affected by rising health care costs than “woke” largely let them get away with it, so long as they keep the right-wing catchphrases coming. And for four years after electing them, we lament that the state government doesn’t do anything.
Most of those offices have more power than the lieutenant governor does. But like that old bag of charging cords, they seem to be a poor fit for our present needs.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Leg-7173-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 08:11:41.157980
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-05 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Is Congress facing another shutdown threat? Here’s what to know.,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/05/congress-federal-shutdown-january-2026/,"Funding for much of the federal government runs out Jan. 30. If Congress doesn't approve a deal by then, it could lead to a partial shutdown.","After a record-long government shutdown that ended in November, Congress faces another funding deadline just two months later.
Federal lawmakers are trying to avoid another closure that would lead to furloughs of thousands of federal workers and a pause in some government operations. But the consequences wouldn’t likely be as significant as the one in the fall because a few agencies already have full-year funding through the end of September.
Funding standoffs are becoming increasingly common, and the government has been operating for a while on short-term bills to keep things running at current levels. And that has left Congress more susceptible to shutdown threats.
With lawmakers returning from the holiday recess this week, they have a short window to strike a funding deal on an appropriations package for the rest of fiscal year 2026 or opt to pass another short-term bill to give them more time for negotiations.
If they are unable to approve any funding fix by the end of the month, the government could fall into a partial shutdown.
Here’s where things currently stand.
Why is government funding running out in January?
Congress set the next funding deadline for Jan. 30 as part of a bipartisan deal that reopened the government in mid-November.
Members passed three of the 12 full-year spending bills that fund specific government agencies for fiscal year 2026: military construction projects and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, and the Legislative Branch which keeps Congress operating. Those funds will last until Sept. 30, which is the end of the federal fiscal year.
Meanwhile, the rest of the government agencies are operating on flat funding that will expire at the end of January.
Congress will either need to pass the remaining nine spending bills that’ll keep the rest of the government funded through September or pass another short-term measure known as a continuing resolution.
Will they meet the deadline to avert a shutdown?
Congress will be tasked with finishing up a broader funding deal with less than a month until the deadline.
Negotiations were underway before the holiday break and will ramp back up again for the next three weeks that Congress is in session in January.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, will play a major role in those negotiations. She’s the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, which crafts and negotiates spending legislation.
Leaders are hopeful they can broker a deal with new topline numbers. But if an agreement on a funding package doesn’t come together, Congress will likely resort to a continuing resolution that’ll keep funding going for a shorter period of time. But passage of that type of legislation isn’t guaranteed either.
Even if funding were to lapse again, it wouldn’t be like last year’s 43-day shutdown.
Some programs that were suspended in the fall, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, wouldn’t be in jeopardy again. That’s because Congress already approved full-year funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees federal nutrition assistance.
Will health care play a role again? 
During the funding standoff in the fall, congressional Democrats made health care one of the central demands to earn their votes. Because of narrow majorities in Congress, Republicans needed Democratic votes at least in the Senate to pass any funding bills.
The debate revolved around the extension of enhanced premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans. With the expiration of those pandemic-era tax credits after Dec. 31, premiums are set to spike for many this year who get their coverage through the state’s marketplace, Access Health CT.
Democrats, including Connecticut’s congressional delegation, have said they’ll keep fighting for the renewal of those expired subsidies that had been in place since 2021.
But it is unclear if the party will once again tie the tax credits to funding the government at the end of January, though they could make new demands.
Separately from government funding, various groups of lawmakers are seeking a legislative solution to bring back the subsidies, though likely with some limits.
And the House is expected to take up Democrats’ three-year extension after the party and four Republicans forced the issue through a procedural tool called a discharge petition. Because lawmakers collected 218 signatures, it triggers a vote on the House floor.
Even if it passes the House this month, Senate GOP leadership is unlikely to take it up. A vote on the three-year subsidy extension failed to advance in the Senate last month.
Will CT secure the rest of its congressional earmarks?
Connecticut’s congressional delegation scored some of its funding requests for local projects for the first time in years.
That’s because earmarks — now known as congressionally directed spending in the Senate and community project funding in the House — usually only get approved in full-year spending bills.
Lawmakers are able to make requests with some limitations that typically get steered toward pet projects in their states. Connecticut’s delegation has sought funding for infrastructure and environmental investments, social services for families and children, affordable housing and upgrades for police departments and emergency units.
Connecticut’s share of approved earmarks were part of the three full-year spending bills that passed in November to end the shutdown. But dozens of other earmarks requests are in limbo.
If Congress can pass some or all of the remaining nine funding bills this month, Connecticut will secure funding for its other initiatives that amount to tens of millions of dollars. Lawmakers in the state sought at least $177 million in earmarks for FY 2026.
But if the government stays open through a short-term fix, funding for those local projects are unlikely to materialize. Lawmakers will be able to make new earmarks requests later in the year for fiscal year 2027.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25274456520062-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:57:42.254403

Industry groups and climate advocates anxiously await the $126 million initiative. But the state lawmakers who championed it say it’s taken far too long to come online. […],"Freightliner eCascadia electric trucks used in a Coca-Cola Bottling fleet are pictured in 2023. (Photo courtesy of Daimler Truck AG)Washington is close to opening a new incentive program for commercial fleet operators to transition trucks and other vehicles to models that run on electric or hydrogen power.
Industry groups and climate advocates anxiously await the $126 million initiative. But the state lawmakers who championed it say it’s taken far too long to come online.
The transportation sector is the biggest driver of Washington’s carbon emissions. Exhaust from big trucks and buses makes up a disproportionate share of those emissions, and diesel air pollution can be especially unhealthy.
To help combat this, the Washington Zero-Emission Incentive Program, or WAZIP, is expected to launch in the spring.
“We are very eager for WAZIP to launch as soon as possible,” said Leah Missik, the Washington legislative director for environmental advocacy group Climate Solutions. “We know from the experience in other states and even from the experience of people who’ve been able to get clean trucks here in Washington that this program will help drivers and businesses save money, and it will benefit communities.”
Washington has already made some progress.
In 2024, nearly one in five new medium- and heavy-duty vehicles sold in Washington ran on zero-emission technology, according to the state Department of Ecology. Though the adoption rate varies depending on the type. Heavier trucks are harder to come by than, for example, electric delivery vans. Think of Amazon’s ubiquitous Rivian vans.
Heavy trucks, on the other hand, remain prohibitively expensive for many companies, while lacking public charging infrastructure, industry groups say. And they can’t go nearly as far on a charge as their diesel-fueled counterparts, not to mention they’re much heavier.
The city of Seattle has tried its own incentive program offering up to $180,000 for Class 8 heavy-duty trucks to serve the Port of Seattle. But even with that sweetener, operators found the transition still unfeasible financially.
Instead, the city in October partnered with a company called Zeem Solutions to distribute $1.5 million to drayage operators. It follows more than $5 million that the Northwest Seaport Alliance gave the company over the summer for a commercial fleet charging depot in the city of SeaTac.
But while Washington state moves ahead, the federal government has looked to slow the transition. 
Washington has been following the lead of California in its push toward zero-emission vehicles. California has a unique ability to set emission rules that go further than federal guidelines, and other states can pick between the two. Washington has been following California’s stricter standards. 
But Congress this year repealed California’s opportunity to set those standards. States, including Washington, have sued the federal government over the move.
One of those rules pushes manufacturers to up their sales of zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks over time. The move by Congress and approved by President Donald Trump offers a “slight ease of pressure” on the trucking industry, said Sheri Call, president and CEO of the Washington Trucking Associations.
“But it also doesn’t mean that we don’t want to continue the conversation about what industry can do today,” Call continued, “because we do have members who are motivated to reduce their carbon footprint. They just need workable solutions to do so.”
The local trucking industry is also grappling with the Trump administration’s cancellation of federal money meant to fuel a hub of hydrogen development in the region, which aimed to help develop cleaner semitrucks, among other things. Call said this is “very promising technology for the industry, especially in the heavy truck space.”
How will it work?
The WAZIP program is funded by proceeds from the state’s carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act. 
It’ll offer $82 million in vouchers for on-road vehicles, $20 million for off-road equipment, like forklifts and farm equipment. It’ll also have $10 million reserved for small businesses.
For example, buyers of a zero-emission Class 4 medium-duty truck weighing between 14,001 pounds and 16,000 pounds could get $60,000 off at the point of sale, though the final voucher amounts aren’t yet finalized. The vouchers, which increase based on weight, cover electric and hydrogen fuel cell technology.
For reference, a Class 4 diesel truck costs around $60,000 while the electric version is roughly $160,000, according to John Barnes, of TEC Equipment. Diesel Class 8 trucks cost $160,000 compared to $600,000 for electrics.
Voucher applicants can also ask for more money to install charging infrastructure, a major barrier to transitioning to zero-emission vehicles for both businesses and individuals. 
The hope is that trucking companies can get assistance with upfront costs to transition toward electric, then reap the benefits of reduced fuel costs over time.
“I cannot understate the importance of it in terms of hitting our climate targets, but also helping people save money over the long run,” Missik said.
Some businesses will be eligible for even more savings. They include those with under $10 million in annual revenue and those certified as an emerging or rising business by the state’s Office of Women and Minority Owned Business Enterprises. Drayage operators, veteran-owned businesses, nonprofits and public agencies also qualify. 
In the Class 4 example, these purchasers could get an extra $10,000 off.
Businesses can also buy converted or used vehicles with vouchers of reduced value.
The initiative is modeled on similar efforts in California, where a truck incentive program has given out roughly 15,000 vouchers totaling over $1.6 billion in savings in the past 15 years.
Call and Missik both expect WAZIP to be very popular.
What’s taking so long?
But those leading the charge for WAZIP’s creation think it should already be up and running. 
State House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, said it should’ve started up at least six months ago. His counterpart in the Senate agrees.
“The governor’s office and the Department of Transportation know that I’m not satisfied by how long it’s taken to get this done,” Fey said. “It’s beyond the point now that my patience is about done with this.”
In response, the state Department of Transportation noted “this is a complex program that WSDOT needs to ensure is developed and administered properly, because significant state resources are involved.”
“This work includes custom software to meet Washington’s unique needs,” spokesperson Barbara LaBoe said in an email. “WSDOT is working diligently to deliver the program as quickly as possible, while maintaining the high standards for compliance and usability that are required.”

There's also an emphasis on hands-on learning in the class, part of Issaquah School District’s experimental microschool. (Photo by Donna Gordon Blankinship)When Cadence was deciding which 8th grade classes to take at Maywood Middle School, a couple of things influenced the 14-year-old’s choices. 
“I don’t like ELA,” she said, referring to English Language Arts, the term schools use these days for reading and writing. 
So Cadence chose to spend part of her day in Issaquah School District’s experimental microschool, which combines science and English with a focus on the environment, and an emphasis on hands-on learning.
On a recent Friday afternoon, Cadence and her classmates were conducting an experiment to better understand radiation, using skittles and math — and both reading and writing. Earlier in the period, she participated in a class review session employing both writing and conversation. And her class also spoke briefly about the book they had been reading about the groundbreaking chemist and physicist Marie Curie.
In other words, her teacher, Valerie Buck, weaves reading and writing into every day and every project, with or without Cadence and her classmates realizing. It’s a creative approach to meeting students where they are academically.
Customizing education to the needs of individual students is not new. Research has shown for decades that every child requires a slightly different path to academic success. But most schools find it easier to talk about than to actually do in large classes during short class periods.
Issaquah’s microschool program is just one notable example where a Washington school is working hard to overcome those obstacles. Creativity in educational programs appears — in my limited view — to be growing again in these post-pandemic years. Microschools are one option.
Some consider microschools, which are more popular on the East Coast, a leftover from the pandemic. Some families who felt online learning wasn’t working formed their own learning “pods,” where students could both quarantine and learn.
The Maywood program doesn’t exactly fit the microschool model, because it’s not an all-day, standalone program. But it has many of the elements: It is small (50 total students in two classes) and different and has a focus on personalized learning.
Students opted into the program, which the school views, in part, as a way to get them ready for the project-based learning approach at a district high school. Building community is another major goal in Buck’s classroom and another emphasis at many microschools.
The Issaquah project is not offered as an all-day standalone program, although that is a goal, because school officials could not cobble together enough money to launch a larger pilot.
They are lucky to have enough space — tucked away from regular classes — to give them the feeling of being special and unique. And this corner of Maywood has a couple more empty classrooms just begging to be filled with an expanded program, which Buck said would allow them more time for hands-on learning.
Buck chose to focus on the Salish Sea and sustainability and has integrated community service projects to add real-life experience. For example, students did a water use study about shorter showers and visited the Gates Foundation to learn about water and toilets.
“I think it’s important because kids really need purpose with what they’re learning,” Buck said.

Penelope, 13, agreed. “It seemed more interesting than normal classes,” she said between counting “radioactive” skittles in Buck’s class. “You get to do nice hands-on things, which is fun.”
Julia Bamba, the microschool principal who oversees special projects and innovation for the district, said Issaquah started experimenting with alternative school models because they wanted to give students more control over their learning.
The district takes a slow and steady approach to innovation, starting with prototypes that are thoroughly tested before scaling. It’s not good enough for the innovations to meet student desire for variety (or more science and less language arts); they also must meet the district’s high academic standards, Bamba said.
She pointed to a few other public school programs that both inspired Issaquah and keep them thinking about how they can innovate.
Big Picture Learning is a network of schools across the nation and in Washington that emphasizes student-directed learning. And Tacoma Public Schools has become a center for creativity through a maritime education partnership with the Port of Tacoma, and by providing numerous ways students can earn college credit while still in high school. 
‘Customer’ focus and creativity in Spokane
One of my favorite examples of school innovation is Spokane Public Schools. A recent conversation with Kristin Whiteaker, who is director of charter schools, satellite schools and program support for the district, revealed there’s more going on in Spokane than I was aware of.
You may remember that when Washington state started experimenting with charter schools, Spokane was the only district that decided to embed that choice inside their public school walls. But they’ve done a lot more. They not only provided intentional remote learning years before the pandemic, they have strengthened and grown their online school since then. Spokane Virtual Learning welcomes students from across the state and has higher graduation rates (88% in four years) than a lot of regular public schools.
Spokane offers many other choices from the school innovation checklist: Dual-language immersion in Spanish and English, project-based learning, a parent-teacher cooperative model, special resources for homeschool families, a biomedical institute, a standalone highly capable program, and a Montessori school. Spokane also has district-wide school choice so students and families can choose which program is best for them.
Why so many choices? That’s what the community wanted, Whiteaker said.
While many districts across Washington lost enrollment during and after the pandemic, Spokane didn’t. Whiteaker credits their “customer” focus and ongoing academic success.
“We’re constantly surveying families to ask questions about what their interests are and what their perspectives are before we make decisions,” she said.
Whiteaker emphasized that Spokane isn’t just interested in creativity, but academic success.
“We lead with data and research and have a focus on best practices,” she said, adding, “And the heart. Care that comes from the heart is part of our culture.”
They don’t have a microschool, but I’m guessing that’s because Spokane parents haven’t heard of them yet.
An evolving trend
Microschools most closely resemble one-room schoolhouses, although they usually have more than one room. But the idea is the same: small school, multi-aged classes, hands-on, differentiated learning. The concept blossomed during and after the pandemic, but existed well before. 
Their size makes the economics more difficult than the academics, and state regulations can also be a stumbling block. A few states have passed laws giving microschools the right to exist, including Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. Other states, including Oregon, Illinois and Massachusetts, require hybrid authorization similar to private schools.
Many microschools in other states (and potentially in Washington) operate under homeschool laws or as private schools. A 2025 report from the National Microschooling Center estimates that between 750,000 and 2.1 million students attend microschools in the U.S. They are in every state as well as Washington, D.C., and nearly half were founded by parents.
Sixty-one percent of microschools nationally get their funding from tuition, while 38% get at least some of their money from state school choice dollars, such as vouchers. Ten percent get regular public school or charter school funding.
A Washington proposal to establish a pilot project to authorize certified teachers to operate microschools failed to pass during the 2022 legislative session. But districts and private schools are allowed to experiment with the model under existing laws.
Tailored approach
Another Washington microschool, the Kineo School in Kirkland, is private, tuition-funded and designed to serve a neurodivergent student population. It has a multi-age classroom and operates as a one-room schoolhouse for children in kindergarten through third grade. 
Flexibility and personalization are two main values at Kineo, explained school Director Elizabeth Kent. Everyone learns at their own pace and in small groups based on ability, not age.
Kineo and other microschools are not for everyone, Kent said. Children who thrive in larger social groups do better at larger schools. But the benefits outweigh the disadvantages for some children, such as individualized learning, which is much harder to do in a regular classroom of 30 kids with one teacher.
“I don’t know how teachers can work with large groups of students and tailor things,” Kent said.
But Kineo’s low student-teacher ratio — 10 students with two teachers, plus specialists like occupational and speech therapists — comes with a hefty price tag of about $26,000 a year. Kent said that’s about middle of the road for private schools in the area. 
The school was bigger before a large group of students graduated. Kent said they hope to grow again, but won’t go above 40 or 50 students in a few class groups.
Kent said size is an important element of a microschool, but other things, like community and personalized learning, are what make the schools special.
“Meeting individual student needs is huge. I do think you can do that with a traditional program,” she said. “What doesn’t work is if a family expectation doesn’t align with what the school is offering. It’s just not enough to desire a small school.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microschools2-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:11:40.842920

Photo by Tony Webster.Minnesota already gets more than half of its electricity from wind, solar, nuclear and other resources that don’t emit planet-warming carbon dioxide or air pollutants that harm human health. Power plants here emit 50% less greenhouse gas than 20 years ago, according to Clean Energy Economy Minnesota.
Under state law, Minnesota’s power sector needs to go 100% clean by 2040, and there’s a sense among state policymakers, utility leaders and energy system experts that the easy part may soon be over.
Energy system modelers say efforts to reduce power emissions become costlier and more logistically challenging as the grid reorients around weather-dependent renewables. Adding more of what’s known as “clean firm” resources like nuclear, geothermal, hydropower, gas plants with carbon capture, and long-duration batteries — plus more high-voltage power lines — can address what Deloitte researchers call “the last 20%” problem.
The challenge for Minnesota is that these resources all have their own tradeoffs. Policymakers, utilities, labor and host communities appear far from consensus around the best path forward — particularly when it comes to nuclear power plants, which Minnesota law prohibits building more of.
Not fast enough?

The “carbon intensity” of the Minnesota power grid ticked down another 4% in 2024 as utilities and energy developers added more renewable power, Clean Energy Economy Minnesota said in April.
The poster child for those efforts is Xcel Energy’s multiyear plan for the Sherco power plant, which by early next decade is set to host enough carbon-free power to replace most of its retiring coal units’ output. State regulators have approved a host of other clean energy projects over the past two years, including 910 megawatts’ worth — nearly the output of a full-size nuclear power plant — in a two-month span this summer.
For now, utility leaders, regulators and policymakers say Minnesota remains on track to meet its statutory obligation for 100% carbon-free power by 2040, but with a major caveat: electric vehicles, data centers and new industrial loads are pushing electricity demand upward. If built, Minnesota’s dozen or so large data center proposals would consume more power than every home in the state, according to the Star Tribune.
“Solar and wind aren’t going to do everything on their own. Yes, we are building out renewables, but not at the rate our demand for electricity is increasing,” said Rep.

The long-range plans filed by Minnesota’s two biggest for-profit utilities show firm resources like gas plants accounting for a significant share of new additions to the grid over the next decade-plus. Minnesota Power, now majority-owned by the private equity firm BlackRock, wants to add 750 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity to replace a coal power plant set to retire by 2035. Xcel Energy would deploy nearly 3,000 megawatts of batteries and “firm dispatchable” power to its system in the 2030s after adding 420 megawatts of gas at a new southwestern Minnesota power plant later this decade.
Xcel and Minnesota Power say their new gas plants would run only as needed to make up for temporary energy shortfalls caused by high power demand or periods of low wind. And Xcel is designing its Lyon County gas plant to run on a mix of at least 30% hydrogen, which does not emit greenhouse gases when burned and can be produced with carbon-free electricity (or possibly mined from natural reserves).
But in its most recent long-range plan, Xcel admits that squeezing all the greenhouse gas emissions out of its Upper Midwest grid — which covers parts of the Dakotas, Wisconsin and upper Michigan — will require “ingenuity, new technologies, and transmission.”
Leading contenders
None of those new technologies is perfect.
Geothermal power, which taps naturally occurring heat deep underground, has managed to unite environmentalists on the left with MAGA types on the right. That includes former fracking executive and now Energy Secretary Chris Wright. But even the “enhanced” geothermal systems being commercialized across the western United States today are no match for Minnesota’s stable geology, which makes getting the power out of the ground that much more difficult
Another technology that involves drilling thousands of feet into bedrock is carbon capture and sequestration. In theory, any carbon-emitting power plant could retrofit its exhaust system to absorb, liquefy and inject most of its greenhouse gas emissions deep underground.

Like geothermal power, however, long-term carbon storage requires specific subsurface conditions absent in Minnesota and much of the Midwest. Most power plants in the region would thus need to tie into yet-to-be-built pipelines like the long-planned Summit network, which would pipe carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Minnesota and four neighboring states to a storage site in western North Dakota.
Summit’s future is uncertain due to a recent regulatory setback in South Dakota and opposition from property owners regionwide. Even if it moves ahead, it will cost billions and take years to bring online. Perhaps more appealing is the potential for captured carbon to be used as an input for locally made “e-fuels” that could one day replace petroleum-based fuels for airplanes, ships and other heavy vehicles — if the economics ever make sense.
Theo Keith, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, said Minnesota’s biggest investor-owned electric utility is taking a wait-and-see approach. Xcel doesn’t currently have plans for carbon capture and doesn’t think it’s needed to reach the 2040 goal, but it “could play a role in the future of clean energy as the technology improves and the cost comes down,” he said.
Then there’s long-duration energy storage, a grab-bag of surprisingly low-tech solutions that deliver power for at least 10 hours.
Some, like the iron-air batteries Great River Energy plans to power up next year, can discharge at full capacity for several days on end. While the lithium-ion batteries dominating the grid are now cheap enough to enable 24/7 solar power in sunnier parts of the world, they may never be economical for riding out the multi-day stretches of low sun and wind Minnesota sees every winter.
Long-duration energy storage could help. But it faces its own technical and economic challenges, particularly around energy losses during charging and discharging, said Kevin Pranis, marketing manager for Laborers International in Minnesota and North Dakota. Pranis’ union hosted the October nuclear forum.
“If you only get half your energy back, it costs twice as much to run,” he said. “I could see iron-air batteries totally transforming the world and eclipsing everything else — or not.” (Coal, gas and nuclear power plants also lose a lot of energy when converting heat to electricity.)
Efficiency is one thing nearly everyone involved in Minnesota energy policy agrees on, even if they emphasize different aspects.
The controversial bill that extended key tax breaks for data centers this year also requires large-scale computing facilities to pay up to $5 million annually into a home weatherization fund for lower-income Minnesotans. Sen. Nick Frentz, a Mankato Democrat who supported the bill, said that provision would reduce customers’ electric bills and relieve stress on the grid itself.
“I’m surprised how little attention that feature is getting,” he said. “The less energy these houses use, the less pressure on our grid…it’s a big win.”

Meanwhile, DFL Reps. Larry Kraft and Kari Rehrauer want Xcel Energy and other Minnesota utilities to develop “virtual power plants” to offset 10% of their electric demand within three years.
Virtual power plants use home batteries, thermostats and other small-scale energy resources to alleviate grid constraints on the relatively rare occasions — typically on the hottest summer days — when power demand pushes the otherwise overbuilt grid to its limit. They’re far cheaper than conventional power plants, can be deployed in months rather than years, and help get more out of the existing grid without expensive new infrastructure, said George Damian, director of government affairs for Clean Energy Economy Minnesota.
“We have a system that we’ve already paid for…(so) how can we operate it better,” Damian said.
The nuclear option
Some say Minnesota’s grid would operate better if it had more nuclear power — the one resource it’s not allowed to add courtesy of a 30-year-old legislative moratorium.
At the October forum, speakers hailed the economic and environmental benefits of nuclear power. Nuclear plants employ twice as many people as similarly-sized coal plants. They pay better than most other energy employers. They’re cleaner, even considering the issue of waste storage. They’re usually the biggest taxpayers in their communities: Xcel’s Prairie Island nuclear plant accounts for 54% of Red Wing’s city tax base and 40% of its school district’s tax base, according to an analysis by Center for Energy and the Environment. And despite high construction costs, they may actually reduce the long-run cost of reaching 100% clean power.
“Eighty to 85% of the electricity we are going to need will come from tools we already have,” like wind, solar, batteries and high-voltage transmission, said Michael Noble, former executive director of St. Paul-based Fresh Energy. But “if we rely on (them) to do 100% of the job, we’re going to pay way too much for electricity…we need firm power that you can turn on when you need it,” he added.
Noble said he was motivated to speak publicly for the first time about his support for nuclear power because after decades of dithering, the industry “has its act together enough to build new nuclear.”
Dozens of startups have designs for “small modular” nuclear plants they say are safer and cheaper to build than the full-size reactors operating today. So do a handful of better-known companies, like GE and Rolls-Royce. And after 30 years during which the United States added virtually no nuclear capacity, two full-size reactors powered up earlier this decade in Georgia.
The Trump administration is all-in on nuclear. Wright, the secretary of the Department of Energy, sat on the board of well-connected nuclear startup Oklo before taking his current job. In the year since, he has reduced his department’s support for renewables while putting billions toward nuclear, geothermal and fossil fuels.
President Trump himself could reap billions from the proposed merger of his social media company and another startup aiming to commercialize nuclear fusion, a nascent technology that futurists hope ushers in an era of cheap, near-limitless energy without the long-lived radioactive waste.
Minnesota nuclear proponents want the state to lift its moratorium — the country’s strongest — and join the party. Other Midwestern states — including Democratic leaning states — have done the same: Wisconsin in 2016, Illinois just this year. If Minnesota doesn’t act soon, the long-awaited nuclear construction boom could pass it by, said Aaron Rosenthal, research director for North Star Policy Action.
“As other states have taken action on this…Minnesota is increasingly the outlier,” Rosenthal said at the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance forum. Rosenthal was the sole credited author on a pro-nuclear policy paper distributed at the event.
A Republican-led effort to repeal the nuclear construction ban came up short in the 2025 legislative session, but lawmakers are likely to try again in 2026 as development-hungry Greater Minnesota communities turn up the pressure. A coalition of 18 rural counties joined the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance in October, followed by future Xcel gas plant host Lyon County in November.
Arguments against new nuclear plants emphasize high construction costs and long build times. The two new Georgia reactors came in seven years late and $17 billion over budget, double the initial estimate. North America’s first small modular reactor, in Ontario, looks more expensive than expected, too. Proponents say costs will come down as more plants get built, citing the “learning curves” that have made wind, solar and now batteries competitive with fossil fuels; skeptics aren’t so sure.
But that debate is almost a sideshow in Minnesota. Here, any successful effort to lift the moratorium runs through the Prairie Island Indian Community, which remains opposed. In the 1970s, an Xcel predecessor company kept the tribe in the dark as it built the Prairie Island nuclear plant on its doorstep. Since the 1990s, amid a federal stalemate on long-term nuclear waste storage, radioactive spent fuel has accumulated at the site over what Rosenthal’s paper called “explicit tribal objections.” At the forum, Igo called the tribe’s treatment “horribly wrong.”
It’s an existential issue for a community whose federal recognition is tied to that particular piece of land, said Blake Johnson, the tribe’s government relations specialist.
“If something were to happen that made us evacuate and not able to return, we don’t exist as a tribe…there is still no solution to the waste that sits 700 yards from our people,” he said at the forum. The tribe’s consultations with legislators last session failed to yield a breakthrough, he added.
Igo said he would keep trying.
“We are going to move forward together or we’re not going to move forward,” he said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/24077210421_cc6f35e9aa_o-1024x646.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:11:40.842920

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)With 2026 already underway, there are a few faces we are watching in state government. Will Indiana’s Senate Republican leader face pushback from his own caucus?  Will Democrats break through in a statewide race?
Here are five Hoosier politicos who could have an interesting year:
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray: The leader of the Senate has taken national heat for his role in the defeat of the redistricting bill. When the president of the United States is taking your name in vain, it’s not a great day. So, the question is what happens next? He isn’t up for re-election until 2028, so the primary threats are mitigated in his case. But does he still control his fractured caucus? Theoretically anyone could challenge him for his leadership post but if the redistricting vote is an indicator, Bray has the necessary support to remain. A bigger concern is his relationship with Gov. Mike Braun and House Speaker Todd Huston — both big supporters of the map redraw.

Braun has been especially upset that the Senate, at least initially, ignored his special session call. Bray reversed course and the public vote was a bit embarrassing for Braun given that Republicans have a supermajority in both legislative chambers. If Braun wants his legislative agenda to move, he will have to temper that anger. Meanwhile, Bray and Huston work closely on virtually every topic going through the General Assembly and must maintain that relationship to get past intraparty squabbles.
Speaking of Braun, he is our next person to watch. And he needs some solid wins.
In 2025, he did secure some property tax relief for Hoosiers — up to $300 for many  — but the final product was far afield from his original proposal. And we all know how redistricting went.

So, what can we expect from Braun in 2026? It’s a little unclear. His office hasn’t unveiled a specific legislative agenda even as the session resumes. And it’s ending in late February, meaning there isn’t much time to get substantive proposals done.
Braun told the Indiana Capital Chronicle he wants to focus on health care costs but didn’t give any examples of how that would occur. Lawmakers have been working on health care for several years and have a bit of fatigue on the topic.
The governor will likely face an interstate tolling debate in 2026 as the state looks for more revenue to maintain and upgrade highways. One area he is poised for big wins is on the utility front. But only if the new regulators he has named to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission come through — blocking rate hikes and generally tapping the brakes on utility profits.
For the first time in a decade, Hoosiers will see the Bayh name back on a statewide ballot. But it’s not Evan Bayh — Indiana’s former governor and U.S. senator. Instead, it’s his son Beau Bayh, a lawyer and Marine Corps captain running for secretary of state.

The 30-year-old Democrat has been on the campaign trail for months, meeting with potential voters in diners and gyms around the state. And he’s been raising money — lots of it. Since he formally launched his campaign in October, he has already raised over $1 million in large donations.
He must get past Blythe Potter at the Democratic state convention in June — a small businesswoman with her own military service record — if he wants to take on Republican Diego Morales in November. If Beau Bayh doesn’t beat Morales, who has had numerous missteps in office, Indiana Democrats will be demoralized.
Beau Bayh does have one Achilles heel — while born in Indiana he has lived most of his life on the East Coast. That was due to his father serving in the U.S. Senate and then he attended college and law school at Harvard. Republicans will use that to label him an outsider.
The race I’m most interested in this year is that of Fort Wayne Republican Sen. Liz Brown. It’s a fascinating look at how GOP politics have split in Indiana — with longtime Republicans now considered not conservative enough if they buck the party line even a little.
Brown has been one of the most strident anti-abortion voices in the state and a reliable Republican since she came to the Indiana Senate in 2015. But she got crossways with a few GOP stalwarts — including U.S. Sen. Jim Banks and Attorney General Todd Rokita. That’s because she refused to hear an immigration crackdown bill last year that she thought needed too much work.
Before that she voted against a bill to eliminate firearm licensing requirement and another banning transgender Hoosiers from high school sports.
Banks and Rokita recruited a primary challenger — well-known Allen County politico Darren Vogt.
Brown was among the most vocal in support of the recent move to redistrict Indiana’s congressional districts, and resigned a Senate leadership post in frustration. Bray later took away her Judiciary Committee chairmanship.
The last B to watch for is Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith. That’s because he is always making news, but not necessarily for the best of reasons.

In 2025, he had his share of controversy. From buying a luxury SUV to firing an employee who later alleged some members of the staff watched an AI-generated-porn video in the office. His employees regularly closed the Statehouse office in the summer, too. And his close friend and pastor is facing a sex scandal at his church.
Plus, Beckwith said the 3/5 compromise was a good thing and received a reprimand from Senate leadership. He often butts heads with Braun — most recently saying the Trump administration threatened federal funding for Indiana before deleting the his tweet.
It’s unclear what to expect from Beckwith in 2026 because he doesn’t follow any government or political norms. Which is just the way he likes it.

A mix of corporate donors, small-dollar contributors and others with big pockets – that latter of which appear to be pulling for Democratic U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham and Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake.
As the new year begins, the 2026 primary season is in full swing, and the top three U.S. Senate candidates on the Democratic side of the aisle each have millions of dollars to play with as they march toward August 4, the date on which voters will choose party nominees for the November general election.
The same can be said of Republican Mike Rogers, who is also sitting on a mound of cash given to him by wealthy donors throughout 2025, giving him a steep advantage as a candidate who is already maneuvering like he’s in the general election race.
Year-end 2025 campaign finance reports aren’t due until the end of January, which will detail spending between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 while also wrapping up the contribution and spending totals for the previous year. 
Reports that are available show that each of the three major players on the Democratic side of the race are in a tight race money wise, with Stevens having the advantage, but mostly due to campaign committee transfers she infused into her Senate bid from her congressional committee.
What’s more interesting, however, is where that money is coming from and who’s giving it.
Stevens flush with larger donor cash, some from large corporations
Stevens raised $4.72 million between April and October 2025, with $3.11 million coming from direct individual, organization and PAC contributions. The transfer from her congressional committee totaled $1.53 million.
Federal Election Commission reports show that Stevens also received $6,000 from the Blue Michigan PAC, which is supporting her campaign. Bridge Michigan reported that the group has also spent significant money on text message support for Stevens.
She spent $2.6 million up until Oct. 1, and ended the quarter with $2.6 million cash on hand, putting her in a strong spot as the candidates move into the heart of primary season.

Part of that had to do with her larger dollar donations from wealthy individuals. FEC data shows that the largest share of Stevens’ fundraising haul came from donations of $2,000 or more ($1.79 million) and donations of $1,000 to $1,999 ($751,316).
Public FEC reports also show that Stevens has amassed tens of thousands of dollars from multiple large corporations, including:

Amazon and Blue Origin PAC, owned by Amazon chief Jeff Bezos (a combined $39,000);
Google’s NetPAC ($11,500);
FedEx PAC ($23,000);
Delta Airlines PAC ($35,000);
the Boeing Company PAC ($13,500);
Norfolk Southern Corporation’s Good Government Fund ($1,000);
Walmart’s PAC For Good Government ($24,000);
DoorDash’s DashPAC ($5,900);
The McDonald’s Corporation PAC ($3,000);
Charter/Spectrum’s PAC ($18,000); and
Nucor Corporation PAC ($15,000)

Each of the companies have a history of reportedly questionable labor practices and union-busting activity.
Stevens has positioned herself as a strong supporter of unions throughout her career in Congress, introducing labor-focused legislation in the House, and has racked up various endorsements from unions like the  Teamsters Local 243, UNITE Here Local 24, Pipefitters, Steamfitters, Refrigeration & Air Conditioning Service Local Union 636, and IronWorkers Local 25.
Rogers raised less than his rivals in the bulk of 2025, but with billionaire support
Not to be outdone, Rogers raised $3.41 million, but only $1.87 million of that came from direct contributions. Bridge Michigan also reported that some of his fundraising haul came from the “Team Rogers” joint fundraising committee.

Rogers’ total fundraising haul was also aided by a nearly $1.5 million transfer from other committees, including Team Rogers.
Rogers spent $966,938 in the first two quarters of 2025, and owes nearly $6,000 in debt owed to his campaign.
That leaves Rogers with $2.7 million cash on hand.
Rogers is also sitting on $5 million donated to the Great Lakes Conservative Fund super-PAC supporting his bid from Tim Dunn, a Texas oil billionaire with deep ties to the Christian Nationalist movement and a rising presence in the national GOP scene.

The Gander also reported that Team Rogers accepted a $12,000 contribution from John W. Childs, a billionaire megadonor who was charged in 2019 with soliciting prostitution in a Florida massage parlor sting.
Rogers’ only rival for the GOP nomination is former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Bernadette Smith, who entered the race in late November, too late for mandatory fundraising reports.   
McMorrow and El-Sayed trailing, but not far behind
McMorrow, who announced her candidacy in March 2025, raised $3.85 million through October, amassing a greater share of dollars than Stevens did in total direct contributions at $3.82 million. McMorrow also had zero transfers from previous campaign committees.
She did, however, spend $2.4 million. That leaves McMorrow with $1.45 million cash on hand, but with zero debt owed to her campaign.
Unlike Stevens, McMorrow’s largest share of contributions came from people giving $200 or less ($2.08 million), but McMorrow’s second largest share of donations came from the $2,000 or more category ($899,772).

El-Sayed has been trailing his Democratic primary rivals in fundraising, but not by much.
He raised $3.57 million up until October with $3.56 million coming from direct contributions, still more than Stevens but not as much as McMorrow. El-Sayed spent $1.72 million up until October, the least of the three candidates.
Like Stevens, El-Sayed’s largest donation category came from those giving $2,000 or more ($1.6 million), but his second largest portion of his overall contributions came from the $200 and under club ($961,749).

Becky Currie will try again in the coming legislative session to push through Mississippi prison health care reforms. 
A similar effort by the Republican chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee fizzled and died in in last year’s session.   
In an interview outlining her plans, Currie said she will introduce legislation based on findings gleaned from numerous tours of Mississippi’s prisons as well as instances of alleged denial of medical care documented by Mississippi Today. 
The findings have come to light as the state continues to direct hundreds of millions a year to a private medical contractor, VitalCore Health Strategies. 
“We’ve got to give patients – I call them patients because when you’re sick, you’re a patient no matter where you are – we’ve got to give them the care that the taxpayers have already paid for,” Currie said. 

Mississippi Today’s “Behind Bars, Beyond Care” series has documented alleged routine denial of health care in Mississippi prisons: potentially thousands of people living with hepatitis C going without treatment, an untreated broken arm that resulted in amputation and delayed cancer screenings one woman said led to a terminal diagnosis. One ex-corrections official said people are experiencing widespread medical neglect in Mississippi’s prisons, and revealed internal communications between department officials lamenting the quality of care provided by VitalCore.
During the 2025 legislative session, Currie took to the floor of the Mississippi House and presented a wide-ranging list of examples that she said showed inadequate medical care in state prisons. In some cases the lack of care resulted in unnecessary suffering and death, she said.
Many of the issues have been allowed to persist because the state Department of Corrections is policing its own provision of health care at prisons, Currie said. 
Currie last year drafted a bill that introduced numerous reforms, including giving authority to the Mississippi Department of Health to review prison health care and make policy changes. 
Other central tenets of the bill included ensuring that inmates have access to 24/7 medical care, dispensing medication in a way that ensures inmates who need it actually receive it, requiring prisons to provide communal electronic kiosks for prisoners to request medical appointments and waiving fees for a wide range of medical services. 
Long considered one of the most conservative members of the Mississippi House, Currie secured support from the entire House, winning over everyone from tough-on-crime Republicans to criminal justice reform-minded Democrats. The bill passed 118-0 in the House. It was amended and whittled down before passing the Senate, but ultimately died in late negotiations between the chambers.
Currie believes the bill contained too many provisions, drawing opposition from the office of Gov. Tate Reeves and some of his Senate allies. Currie said Reeves’s office wanted to hire a private firm to conduct a review of prison health care instead of the Department of Health, a debate that loomed over the bill as House and Senate negotiators failed to agree on a final version in the closing days of the 2025 session.
To avoid a similar impasse this year, Currie will introduce many of the same measures, but in separate bills.
“I had it kind of like the Big, Beautiful Bill,” Currie said. “I had the big health care bill for MDOC, which was a failure on my part, because they were able just to say, ‘Oh no, we don’t want all of that this year.’ I’ll come at it a little differently (this year) and do it piece by piece.” 
One key policy fix Currie plans to reintroduce this year is revamping the process by which inmates request medical attention at many prisons. Prisoners often still need to rely on guards to bring them to an infirmary. This arrangement gives guards, who are not medical professionals, the power to determine whether a prisoner receives immediate care.
“We’re still at the part where an inmate has to tell a guard that I need to see a doctor, and he tells them to sit down and shut up, and they never get to see a doctor,” Currie said.
In October, Mississippi Today reported on the case of Christopher Boose, a 38-year-old Mississippi man who fell off his bunk at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility and broke his arm. He was allegedly denied treatment by guards for a week and developed sepsis. Boose, who was serving a one-year sentence for a Drug Court infraction, had his arm amputated. He has filed a federal lawsuit seeking $5 million in damages. 
To prevent similar episodes from happening in the future, Currie plans to push for new requirements to document prisoner requests for medical attention.
“The problem is we keep zero records, and there’s no accountability,” Currie said. “Like the article you did. It’s like oh, well, he lost his arm, I’m so sorry he didn’t get seen. We had to cut his arm off.’ I mean, it’s just, that kind of thing happens so often.”
Another prison health care issue Currie plans to tackle again is the spread of hepatitis C. Documents and private conversations reported by Mississippi Today show the problem appears to be widespread in state prisons.

A major scientific advance in the early 2010s – direct-acting antiviral drugs – transformed treatment regimens for hepatitis C, offering high cure rates, shorter treatment durations and fewer side effects. But the medication can cost the Mississippi system almost $30,000 for a six-week course. Many state prison systems have negotiated lower prices for the medication and are able to treat more patients.
Currie plans to keep pushing for the Department of Corrections and VitalCore to purchase hepatitis C medication through health care organizations enrolled in the federal 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical companies to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices. The program can offer discounts on drugs in the range of 20% to 50%. 
The Department of Health provided MDOC information about how to access 340B pricing, but as of October, the agency had not yet taken steps to obtain the reduced prices, a Health Department spokesperson told Mississippi Today. 
In an interview, Senate Corrections Chairman Juan Barnett, a Democrat from Heidelberg, said that he “vaguely remembered” Currie’s bill and supported some of its key provisions, but wanted to center efforts in his committee around reducing Mississippi’s prison population to free up more money for health care services. 
Barnett said he wasn’t completely satisfied with the performance of VitalCore, the private medical contractor that has raked in hundreds of millions of dollars to provide health care in prisons. 
“My thinking of trying to handle most of that cost is to reduce the prison population by passing legislation that will allow people with certain crimes to be able to be released,” Barnett said. “When you get the population down, then you have more money at your disposal to handle medical issues.”
Mississippi has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world — 661 people per 100,000. About 19,500 people are currently incarcerated in state prisons. 
Currie was initially surprised when House Speaker Jason White made her chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee. But amid a growing chorus of complaints about the provision of health care in Mississippi’s prisons, White told Currie, a former nurse, that she would have free rein to clean up the system. 
“Becky, go get em,” Currie recalls White telling her. 
So she crisscrossed the state, traveling to prisons and speaking with inmates about the issues they faced when trying to receive medical care. She encountered people with jaundice from untreated hepatitis C and women with cancerous lumps growing out of their breasts. 
Despite evidence that prisoners in a state with such a high incarceration rate aren’t receiving proper medical attention, Currie said, she has waged a lonely push for reform.
“It’s just me,” Currie said. “And it’s not that the proof’s not there.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/17162611/MT-Prison-Health-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2026-01-05 07:11:40.842920

Missouri GOP senator slams party leaders for forcing vote on bills without allowing debate

But before that, Democrats intend to make state Senate Republicans pay for invoking the rule to shut off debate — known as the previous question — for the first time since 2020.
With fewer than one-third of the seats in each chamber, the filibuster in the state Senate is practically the only means for the minority party to stall or kill legislation. That is why Democrats are determined to extract a price for using the previous question, but they aren’t saying how that will play out in the annual legislative session that starts Wednesday.
“As far as what that session looks like, everyone will have to wait and see,” Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat, told The Independent last month.  
The only affirmative duty of the General Assembly each year is to pass a state budget. But with a dwindling surplus, revenues in decline, and Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe pushing for elimination of the state income tax, the prospects for easy agreement look murky.
The list of other items awaiting action include issues that generate bipartisan support, such as addressing the growing wait list of people being held in jails who need court-ordered mental health treatments; legislation intended to improve maternal health; and personal agendas of departing lawmakers, including term-limited Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin’s bill to shut down solar power development and desire to regulate pharmacy benefit managers.
There are 10 seats in the state Senate certain to change hands, and all have attracted candidates currently in the Missouri House. Legislators looking to move up — including Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Republican running for the state Senate — will want to take election year achievements home to voters.
“You never know about the Senate, but the House is going to do business as usual, and we’ll just see how things play out in the Senate,” Patterson said in an interview with The Independent.

 Senate dysfunction

When Senate Republican leaders used the previous question rule at the end of last year’s session, it was the first time the motion to shut off debate was invoked during a regular session since 2017.
After the votes passing bills to undo voter-approved paid leave for workers and putting repeal of the 2024 abortion rights amendment on this year’s ballot, Democrats vowed there would be a price to pay in 2026.
“What we’re doing today is a failure of the Senate,” state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Democrat from Columbia said on the final day of the 2025 session. “And when there’s a failure in the Senate, there needs to be a response, and that response can’t last forever, but that response has to happen, and it has to be painful, and has to make us all understand that when the Senate doesn’t function as a body, we all lose.”
The offense, in Democratic eyes, was repeated during the September special session on redistricting, and aggravated by a rules change that sidestepped every opportunity Democrats could use to stall proceedings.
Democrats have to maintain their stall long enough to show that their views must be respected and that the state Senate is designed to be a less partisan body than the House, said state Sen. Tracy McCreery, a Democrat from Olivette.
“One of the challenges with working with some of the newer senators is that they brought the House mentality with them, and they don’t have respect for the institution of the Senate,” McCreery said. “In the Senate we have thoughtful, deliberative conversations, and we don’t just ram things through and not allow for debate.”
O’Laughlin, asked by text about the opening-day atmosphere she expects as she begins her last session as Senate leader, replied only with a head-exploding emoji.

 Budget and taxes

The gap between estimated state general revenue and appropriations in this year’s budget is $2.6 billion. Part of the difference, for state cash flow needs, is artificial because it is new spending on multi-year construction projects or money set aside for unfilled jobs in state government.
The rest must come from the state’s accumulated surplus, which has been diminishing and could be depleted within two fiscal years.
Kehoe has warned his budget proposal on Jan. 13 will be written to bring spending into balance with current revenue. That task will be complicated by the need to replace up to $1.2 billion in spending from non-general revenue funds with general tax revenue. 
“There are only painful budget bills that have money to cut from,” said state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Democrat from Springfield. “And typically in our state, when we have to face budget cuts, we see that in K-12 education, higher education and (appropriation bills) that include things like social services and the social safety net.”
Kehoe’s also expected on Jan. 13 to outline his plan for weaning state government off the income tax. With the tax representing 65% of last year’s $13.4 billion in revenue, the question will be where to find replacement money.
Republican members will be anxious to hear the details.
“We’ll have to see what that proposal will be and what revenue replacements or what revenue sources will be created from those changes,” said state Rep. Jeff Vernetti, a Republican from Camdenton.
Local taxes will also be a major question. State Rep. Tim Taylor, a Bunceton Republican, led a House committee that spent the summer studying property taxes. There are a number of Republicans who want to replace the property tax system with sales taxes.
That could work in some areas but wouldn’t generate enough revenue for rural areas, Taylor said in a recent interview. And for areas that could generate the revenue, the tax rate could be prohibitive.
The state imposes a 4.225% sales tax but local option taxes mean the rate paid at retail in most locations is much higher. And the sales tax is one place to go for replacement revenue for the income tax.
That is unlikely to be popular with voters, Taylor said.
“The thought of increasing sales tax again is really going to put that to pushing 10 cents on $1 or something, and that’s pretty substantial,” Taylor said.
Local governments will be watching both debates closely, said Steve Hobbs, executive director of the Missouri Association of Counties.
“First and foremost this needs to be fair to the citizens of Missouri,” he said.
Property tax is an immensely complex issue to tackle, Hobbs said. One reason, he noted, is that state school aid is tied to local tax effort.
The Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force, appointed by Kehoe, is halfway through its study of school funding. Changes to how local taxes are imposed would change the formula calculations.
And support for education depends on reliable revenue from state taxes, which are about to be overhauled, Hobbs noted.
“You have two legs of your education funding stool you are talking about putting under construction,” Hobbs said. “That is a big lift.”

 O’Laughlin’s agenda

In early December, O’Laughlin wrote on social media about a frustrating experience she had attempting to obtain a prescription while in Jefferson City. Most of the time, she wrote, she gets her medications from a local pharmacy in Clarence, but was frustrated by mixups and miscommunications she blamed on pharmacy benefit managers.
“What is the result of this wondrous cost saving set up? Absolutely nothing good for the customers,” O’Laughlin wrote.
Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, are the mechanisms used by insurance companies to control prescription costs for their plans. Techniques include preferential contracts for particular pharmacy companies, with higher reimbursements or dispensing fees for high-volume chain stores and online providers.
“The rural areas are hardest hit because their pharmacist is also their healthcare advocate, often knowing the patients and literally their entire medical history,” O’Laughlin wrote in response to a question from The Independent.
O’Laughlin endorsed legislation filed by state Sen. Travis Fitzwater, a Republican from Holts Summit, to end preferential clauses in PBM contracts.
Similar legislation last year drew a coalition of opponents that, along with insurance companies, included the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Missouri AFL-CIO. 
The opposition will be daunting, said Abe Funk, owner of John’s Pharmacy in southeast Missouri. Funk’s business operates in six locations, including two in communities with fewer than 1,000 people.
Funk is a member of the Missouri Pharmacy Business Council, which lobbies for independent pharmacies. He’s been calling legislators in his area and will personally visit the Capitol to push for the bill.
To overcome opposition, this year’s bill will focus on revealing the details of how PBMs pay claims. That’s helped change some minds, he said.
“They like the idea of transparency,” Funk said. “They like the idea of actually being able to see what their claims are, their payments. And so we anticipate a different climate this session than we have in the past.”
O’Laughlin’s long-standing opposition to renewable energy development is being ramped up by a 5,000-acre solar power project in Henry County in western Missouri. The project was developed over several years but only revealed publicly at the start of 2024. 
In December 2024, after two incumbent commissioners were defeated for reelection, the Henry County Commission approved an incentive package for the solar project that included $650 million in public-sponsored financing.
A lawsuit invoking a rarely used law requiring the courts to investigate public contracts is heading to trial in October. O’Laughlin has filed a bill for a moratorium on new solar project construction, including stopping work on projects underway but not finished, through Dec. 31, 2027.
The solar projects use valuable farmland, seek tax abatements and other preferential treatment and add little to local economies, O’Laughlin wrote in an email to The Independent.
“I honestly see this as tearing a giant hole in the fabric of our communities socially, fiscally, environmentally,” O’Laughlin wrote to The Independent. “What is there to like about them?”
 Election year prospects

No Democrat has won a statewide election since 2018, and results from 2024 show how daunting it will be for Kirkwood Democrat Quentin Wilson, a state department director from 1998 to 2001, to deny incumbent Republican State Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick a second term.
The auditor’s office is the only statewide race on the ballot. Last year, despite spending $20 million, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Lucas Kunce received just 41.8% of the vote, only two percentage points more than gubernatorial candidate Crystal Quade, who spent about $2 million.
But the difficult statewide race for Democrats doesn’t mean this year’s voting won’t give the party an opportunity to impose significant losses on Republicans. The same voters that gave GOP candidates landslide wins for statewide office handed them defeats on abortion rights, following up on prior liberal ballot measure wins on Medicaid expansion and marijuana legalization.
Republicans have put a measure reinstating the state’s near total abortion ban on the ballot, along with a proposal to change the way majorities are calculated for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative. And the redistricting plan intended to give the GOP an additional seat in the U.S. House faces a possible referendum vote. 
Controversial ballot measures can bring hundreds of thousands of Missourians out for an otherwise unexciting election. That occurred In 2018 and 2020, when a right to work referendum and Medicaid expansion, respectively, were on August primary ballots. In those years, nearly 300,000 more people voted in the Democratic primary than the average of other elections since 2000. 
Millions have already been spent on ballot measures for this year and the total for all will likely exceed $100 million by the time voters go to the polls.
But even a big surge of Democratic voters would only dent, not break, the GOP majority, said Terry Smith, political science professor at Columbia College.
Only 21 of 163 Missouri House seats were decided by 10 percentage points or less in 2024, and early financial reports indicate that only two of the 17 state Senate seats on the ballot appear to be truly competitive in November.
The best result for Democrats, Smith said, would be to break the two-thirds supermajority Republicans enjoy in each chamber. 
After the 2024 election, Republicans held 111 seats in the House and 24 of 34 seats in the Senate.
“Do Republicans  have anything to worry about? I don’t think so,” Smith said in an interview last week with The Independent.
In deeply Republican districts, even if the ballot measures draw a larger Democratic vote, it won’t be enough to change the outcome, Smith said.
“If you go from a district that is 75-25 to 60-40,” he said, “you pick up 15 points and you still lose by a landslide.”

(Nataba/iStock Images)We face a new year with the likelihood that the same divisive and hate-filled words and actions will intrude and dominate much of the public square. Some political leaders observing and adopting behavior from the lesser-civilized among us will prove useful.
Little else seems to be working.
We have all heard the saying, “They fight like cats and dogs.” But, all cats and dogs do not fight each other. Many, if not most, get along just fine.
Actually, our cat takes naps on our dog’s face. However, that has not always been the case. One of our previous dogs found great pleasure in chasing and terrorizing one of our cats. So clearly, it all depends.
It depends on what?
One could speculate that maybe our current dog and cat get along because they grew up together and shared their kitty and puppy days. That is partly the case. But, the dog has also been accepting older adopted cats that were complete strangers with different temperaments. There is no fighting, no chasing. They all get along.
Lesson one: Cats and dogs couldn’t naturally look or behave more differently, and yet whether they grew up together or met as strangers, they still respect each other, live peaceably under the same roof, and often do things together.
There are lessons that members of the Missouri General Assembly can take from that as they convene their 2026 legislative session this week. Members of Congress can do the same.
Respect and getting along are not just common among cats and dogs, but also among other lowly creatures in the animal kingdom.
We have a neighbor who loves animals, especially horses. On any given day when we pass by her farmhouse, it is not uncommon to see horses (large and miniature), donkeys, mules, sheep, goats, even peacocks, turkeys, and chickens of various breeds — all grazing and scratching alongside each other. 
We have yet to witness a fight or scuffle among any of them during nearly two decades we have been neighbors. While we know they might occur, it is not a common occurrence.
One could easily dismiss this example by saying, oh your neighbor operates a petting zoo, or she carefully picks docile animals. She does not. 
There is another likely explanation. She loves animals. She shows it in her actions, her tone, her body language and how she cares for and communicates with them. The animals see and feel her love, and they behave toward her and each other accordingly. 
Lesson two: These animals are different in every way imaginable — unlike us humans who are 99.99% the same — yet they co-exist, they get along. There are many reasons why they do. We can imagine.
Lesson three: First and foremost, our neighbor — the leader in this case — creates the space, sets the tone with the way she treats and communicates with that very diverse animal population.
Do you suppose there are any hints, lessons our political leaders can glean and put into practice?
Examples abound.
Several miles down the road while riding in the countryside, I looked over at a pasture with cows, Shetland ponies, elks, alpacas, and zebras. I thought to myself, what is it that we humans do not get? Those animals don’t speak the same language, certainly do not look alike, and yet they all seem to get along for their common good.
This harmony, respect, and acceptance just described among farm animals likely exists among many animals in the forests and jungles, even in the sea. 
Of course, there are those that do not get along, that prey on each other, and that live in fear of each other. But there are lessons we can learn from them, too. 
It is all about discernment and choice. 
Many choices are available to us. Exposure. Learning. Understanding. Compromise. Acceptance. How we choose to appreciate, work together, and live with each other.
So why do we, supposedly the most civilized animals on the planet, find ourselves promoting, practicing, even wallowing in perpetual discord and divisiveness the aim of which is to do more harm than good. Or, if any good at all, only for the few.
If many of our political leaders do not have, do not like, or haven’t been around animals or taken the time to observe any, maybe this new year is a great time to start or become reacquainted.
Our state and nation cannot perform the greatest good for the greatest number of its citizens by continuing the disrespect and disregard for the rules and laws that promote decency and civility, and most importantly, how we regard each other as fellow human beings traveling this earth entitled to the same rights and privileges.
How have we, who have so much in common, lost our way when many in the animal kingdom have not?
Yes, we do not hold all the same beliefs about everything or have the same life experiences. We all do not have the same visions and goals, or how to accomplish them.
We can disagree, have robust discussions on any issue or problem. But, we need not take advantage and try to destroy each other during the process.
Many aspects of our state and national political environment are on a slippery slope, and goodwilled visionary leaders who are willing to work for our common good are hard to find. It’s time for many of them to look to members of the animal kingdom for guidance.
Even animals accept and appreciate coexistence and the mutual benefits a vibrant living environment can bring.
Why can’t many of our political leaders?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AnimalandPoliticalLeaders2-Nataba-1024x675.jpg,,,2026-01-05 06:57:30.123852

State and federal officials are gearing up to stop the advance of a parasitic fly that is less than 70 miles from the United States border with Mexico.


Since Nov. 25, at least 10 new cases of incidents involving the New World screwworm fly have been confirmed within 400 miles of the border. The flies have been inching their way to the U.S. since they broke the biological barrier created by Panama’s narrow geography in 2022.

“There is a threat of it maybe getting into the southern United States, and then it would most likely end up in Missouri, too, at least maybe some isolated cases,” State Veterinarian Steve Strubberg said. “It’s conceivable that it could happen in the coming year or two.”


Deb Hudman, Missouri Department of Conservation health section chief, added that “transportation of infected animals is most likely how it would enter.”


Experts are hoping for a long winter and cold spring to help keep the flies from crossing the border.


“The cold weather is good,” Hudman said. “Anything as low as 48 degrees Fahrenheit stops the larvae and pupae development, and anything below 59 degrees significantly drops the activity of adult flies.”


Local and federal agencies are working to take advantage of the weather and keep New World screwworm flies out of the U.S. Last month the U.S. Department of Agriculture launched a website hoping to centralize information about the flesh-eating fly.


“The USDA remains focused on implementing our sweeping five-pronged plan to combat New World screwworm. As part of these critical efforts, USDA is working on both sides of the border to ensure a comprehensive response,” said Lyndsay Cole, a USDA spokesperson, in an email.



That five-pronged plan includes a total of $29.5 million in investments to renovate an existing fruit fly production facility in Metapa, Mexico, and to build a sterile insect dispersal facility at Moore Air Base in south Texas. The Mexico facility is expected to open as early as next summer. Planning is also underway to build a new production facility at Moore Air Base, according to the USDA website.


“Unfortunately there won’t be enough of those sterile flies available to us for a few years. It takes a long time to ramp up those production facilities, so we are hoping it stays in Mexico,” Strubberg said.
According to the plan, sterile screwworm flies are among the primary tools the government can use to fight the New World screwworm, but only one plant exists in Panama; it produces 100 million flies a week. A separate plant in Mexico that produced 500 million flies a week was shut down in 2012 for economic reasons.
The goal of producing sterile flies is to have them mate with female flies, which usually mate only once in their lifespan. Using this method, over time the population is reduced back down to zero. The sterile insect technique is what allowed the U.S. to eradicate the flies in the 1960s.


The U.S. government has worked closely with Panama since the now-broken biological barrier was formed.
 A costly wipeout



Screwworm was eradicated in the U.S. in 1966 at the cost of around $750 million. This time around, the USDA’s Economic Research Service says it could cost the Texas economy alone $1.8 billion over the next year if the fly gets into the United States.


Losses of $730 million are predicted to fall onto cattle producers. Nine of the last 10 confirmed cases of screwworm within 400 miles of the U.S. have come from bovines, according to data collected by the USDA.


“If it would come in, we would have such a great expense of eliminating it,” Strubberg said. “There are just so many different areas of added expense for individual producers.”


The impacts it would have on consumers are harder to predict, Strubberg said. But potential spikes from a dip in supply and increased expenses from dealing with screwworm could add to shelf costs.


To help the government contact producers in a potential infested zone, Strubberg urges people to register their premises through the Missouri Department of Agriculture if they have animals. The premises registration form can be found here.
 Cows and wildlife: easy targets




The flies can infest all living warm-blooded animals. This includes humans, pets, livestock and wild animals. Some signs to look out for in infected animals include an open wound or navel that looks infected, decreased activity and animals isolating themselves.


“The larvae are basically maggots,” Strubberg said. “They are much more aggressive than the normal maggots of the common flies we have around Missouri right now, and so they will cause a lot more damage.”


If an animal gets infected, there are a few treatment options. If treated, animals can make full recoveries, but untreated it is “very devastating,” Strubberg said.


“If you catch it early enough and treat it, you would do some surgical procedures to remove the larvae and hopefully treat them so they don’t mature,” Strubberg said. “There are systemic treatments of infested animals also; some of the larvae are so deep that you can’t remove them all surgically.”


The FDA conditionally approved a new topical solution for the prevention and treatment of New World screwworm in cattle over 2 months old, Exzolt Cattle-CA1. The drug is in the same family as Bravecto, an oral drug used for flea and tick prevention in dogs and cats.


“Exzolt Cattle-CA1 is eligible for conditional approval because it is intended to prevent and treat serious or life-threatening diseases in cattle, it addresses unmet animal health needs, and demonstrating effectiveness of the drug requires complex or particularly difficult studies,” the Food and Drug Administration said in a news release.


“Pets are also an easy way for screwworm to be transported,” Strubberg said. “We are working with every entity we can to try and get pet owners and all animal owners aware.”


He says to monitor pets to make sure they don’t have any open wounds and are feeling well. Strubberg added it’s important to be especially vigilant if you recently traveled to a place with an active screwworm population like Central and South America.


“If anyone is purchasing pets from outside the state, you definitely want the veterinarian to take a good look at it,” Hudman said.


Missouri’s wild animal populations would be at risk as well.


“Deer would be something to keep an eye on because they have lots of wounds from running, vehicle strikes and fences,” Hudman said. “It could certainly be present in raccoons, opossums, coyotes and rabbits. Really any warm-blooded species with an open wound.”


Wild populations would be next to impossible to contain and treat because they aren’t behind a fence or in a barn, Hudman said.


“You would have to trap all of them, and then you would have to treat them, then the first treatment might not take,” she said. “I just don’t see how that would be very viable.”


The only wild populations that might be possible to protect are ones with small, localized populations. Hudman pointed to Missouri’s elk population as an example.


The Missouri Department of Conservation is working closely with the Missouri Department of Agriculture and the USDA to develop a plan to combat the potential arrival of screwworm. A plan is currently not finalized.


“We’re setting up and making sure there are microscopes all around the state with people who can identify the larvae so we can have a local or regional way to approach it,” Hudman said.
 Screwworm fly impostor



Another challenge Missouri faces in identifying potential screwworm infestations is a different species of blowfly that looks like the screwworm fly. That species of blowfly feeds off dead tissue instead of living tissue.


“It’s going to be very tricky for the general public to tell the difference between the two, and the one that feeds off of dead tissue is very prevalent,” Hudman said.


While the New World screwworm fly hasn’t been detected in the U.S., Hudman advises caution toward the potential presence of the fly in the coming years.

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Lugo testified through a statement read by attorney Rex Anderegg in a hearing of the Assembly Committee on State Affairs. He said he experienced constant lockdowns that severely restricted his movement and some correctional officers treating him as less than human. 
Lugo, 36, was convicted of first-degree reckless homicide in 2009 and spent the majority of his incarceration in Waupun Correctional Institution, the state’s oldest prison, which has received scrutiny for prison deaths and living conditions. After Lugo’s conviction was overturned, he was released from jail in June 2023.
According to Christopher Lau of the Wisconsin Innocence Project, the project has helped exonerate more than 30 people. Clients leave prison with medical ailments and emotional trauma, without familial support, employment, savings, and often, with nowhere to call home, his testimony stated. Many struggle to re-enter society. 
Exonerees often have to wait months to get on the agenda for the claims board’s meetings, Lau stated. If they qualify, the law doesn’t provide enough to ensure stable housing, he said, “to say nothing of the costs of social services like counseling, vocational assistance and access to health insurance.” 
The Wisconsin Claims Board can award up to $25,000 in compensation, at a rate not greater than $5,000 per year for the imprisonment, and has also awarded attorney fees. It can recommend that the state Legislature issue additional compensation. 
In February 2016, the Assembly unanimously approved a bill that aimed to increase state support for wrongly convicted people, including enabling the claims board to issue higher payouts. It did not become law. 
AB 583, a bill currently in the Legislature, also aims to provide more aid more quickly to wrongly convicted people. Under the bill, a wrongly convicted person would receive compensation at a yearly rate of $50,000, prorated daily, for the imprisonment; the total would not exceed $1 million. The claims board would adjust the rate yearly to account for the cost of living, and it would be able to award compensation in an annuity payable over time. 
The bill addresses when people who received compensation for wrongful imprisonment in the past can petition for more under the new law, potentially allowing some to receive more compensation. 
The bill lays out when wrongly convicted people could have health care coverage under plans offered by the Group Insurance Board to state employees. 
Under the bill, if a person is released from imprisonment on the basis of a claim of innocence, they could petition for a court order directing the Department of Corrections to create a transition-to-release plan. They could also petition for a financial assistance award of up to 133% of the federal poverty level for up to 14 months, or while compensation proceedings are pending, whichever is shorter. 
State legislators who introduced the bill included Republican and Democratic lawmakers. Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine), chair of the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety, submitted testimony in support of the bill. 
The bill bars some people from filing a petition with the claims board for compensation for wrongful imprisonment, such as a person who is convicted of a violent crime after being released. 
Records-sealing language
Also under the bill, a person released from imprisonment on the basis of a claim of innocence could petition the court for the sealing of all records related to the case. For Lugo, it took about two years to get a response from job applications because his case was still visible online, his statement said. 
A similar provision in the bill that the Assembly passed in 2016 drew pushback from the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, which argued that it would “dramatically compromise the ability of media and the public to examine what went wrong in cases in which things are known to have gone terribly wrong.”
On Dec. 22, the Wisconsin Examiner reached out to the office of Rep. Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek), one of the lawmakers who introduced the bill, about the provision and the council’s concern in 2016. 
“Thank you for bringing this information to our attention as we were not aware of this when we introduced the bill this session,” Rodriguez said in an emailed comment. “The organization has not reached out to us with any concerns at this time.”
Lawsuits
Wrongly convicted people may also attempt to obtain a monetary award through lawsuits. The bill addresses the possibility of a person receiving a settlement, judgement or award for damages in a federal or state action related to their wrongful imprisonment. 
Under one of these parts of the bill, if the person obtains a settlement before the claims board awards them compensation, the claims board would subtract the amount from the board’s compensation. 
Changing the process
Under current law, the claims board is responsible for finding whether the evidence of the person’s innocence is “clear and convincing.” 
The claims board members come from the Department of Justice, the Department of Administration, the Office of the Governor, the Wisconsin Senate and the Wisconsin Assembly. The Senate and Assembly members are Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) and Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Markesan).
Under the bill, when the claims board receives a petition for compensation for an innocent convict, it would be referred to the Division of Hearings and Appeals in the Department of Administration. The division would find whether the evidence is clear and convincing that the petitioner was innocent of the crime they were imprisoned for. 
If the evidence is clear and convincing for innocence, the division would transmit its findings to the claims board, which would decide what amount of compensation would be equitable. 
Individual bills
In a decision dated Jan. 30 of this year, the claims board awarded $25,000 to Gabriel Lugo, plus approximately $77,000 in attorney fees, and recommended that the Legislature award him an additional $750,000.
According to Rodriguez, the Legislature has only passed individual appropriation bills awarding additional compensation three times. 
Rodriguez’s testimony stated that it’s estimated that around 72 people have been exonerated in Wisconsin since 1990, and that seven received recommendations for compensation above the cap. She stated in a press release that “the Legislature should not have to play judge and jury again” when there is already a process at the claims board. 
“Without these reforms, exonerees would continue to need individual appropriation bills to receive an adequate amount of compensation,”  Rodriguez stated in a press release. “These bills have rarely been acted upon, and even more rarely are signed into law.”
The board has also recommended that the Legislature issue additional compensation for Robert and David Bintz, who were released from prison in the fall of last year.

(Photo by Hal Brown/New Jersey Monitor)In the nearly four years since Matt Platkin became New Jersey’s 62nd attorney general, his critics have multiplied.
Republicans tried to impeach him. Democrats accused him of weaponizing his office to attack their allies. State police unions sued him. Someone even sent voters mailers attacking him, a move usually reserved for political candidates in bare-knuckle election contests. (Platkin ran for public office just once — when he became the first sixth grader at his middle school elected to student government.)
Platkin regards it all as a measure of his success.
“I haven’t shied away from tough decisions and tough cases,” he said. “If you do this job for four years and you haven’t pissed anybody off, then you really haven’t done the job the right way.”
With just weeks left before Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill takes office and installs a new attorney general, Platkin shared his proudest moments, biggest frustrations, future plans, and more in a wide-ranging interview with the New Jersey Monitor.
 On corruption and criticism
Gov. Phil Murphy named Platkin, a Democrat and his former chief counsel, attorney general in February 2022.
As head of the state Department of Law and Public Safety, Platkin leads an office of about 8,000 people and oversees police, criminal and civil investigations and prosecutions statewide, and more.
His corruption crackdowns typically grab the most attention, both because he’s targeted some of the state’s most powerful people, such as South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, and because those cases don’t always hold up in court. State judges tossed Platkin’s criminal indictments of Norcross and more than a dozen correctional officers involved in a brutality scandal at the women’s prison, among others.
Those fumbles have fueled calls for an outside review of Platkin’s public corruption unit and prompted state legislators from both parties to try to take the state police from his control and subject his staff to wiretaps.
Platkin called the criticism “baseless personal attacks” rooted in his mission to hold people accountable, regardless of political party or position, from drug traffickers up to President Donald Trump.
“These are people with positions of power who have bully pulpits. I don’t hear them saying it’s political prosecutions when we take down 30-plus-defendant mafia rings or drug cartels or gangs engaged in gun violence. But when you prosecute a politician, people who don’t like it want to accuse you of having a political agenda,” Platkin said. “That’s not new, by the way, but I do think the severity of the attacks has increased, and they’re completely unfounded.”
A Norcross spokesman declined to comment for this story. When a state Superior Court judge dismissed the charges against Norcross last year, Norcross attorney Michael Critchley said Platkin “trashed” the reputation of the Attorney General’s Office with the “sham” indictment. Platkin’s office is appealing.

 A national ‘embarrassment’
One of Platkin’s more public clashes with his critics came earlier this month, when a Senate panel unanimously passed a bill that would have weakened the state comptroller’s office, which also investigates public corruption.
That hearing was helmed by Sen. James Beach (D-Camden), a close Norcross ally and architect of the plan to remove state police from the Attorney General’s Office. Beach clashed with Platkin, U.S. Sen. Andy Kim, and acting Comptroller Kevin Walsh when they testified against the bill, telling Platkin, “You, sir, have drug down the department!”
Platkin called the hearing an “embarrassment” and followed it up with an unusual written rebuke to Beach, accusing him of violating the free speech rights of the bill’s critics by limiting the time they could testify about the measure while allowing some of the bill’s supporters to speak at length about it.
Platkin told the New Jersey Monitor that the government cannot discriminate against people because it doesn’t like their speech.
“Once you open the door up to give people a platform to speak, you have to give everyone a fair shot to speak,” he said. “He stacked the deck. He was dismissive, he was arrogant, he was aggressive, he was insulting — to a United States senator, just as he was to ordinary residents of our state. And what message does that send to people of New Jersey and across the country, who have the lowest level of faith in their government institutions that they’ve had since the Civil War?”
Beach declined to comment through a spokesman. Sen. Nicholas Scutari, who sponsored the bill, later withdrew it and said he won’t meddle again with the comptroller’s powers.
 Taking on his boss
Platkin also tangled with Murphy after first lady Tammy Murphy launched a bid for the U.S. Senate seat when its former occupant, Bob Menendez, was indicted and later convicted in a global bribery scheme and resigned in disgrace.
Kim was the first to announce he wanted the seat. As the state’s party leaders lined up to endorse Tammy Murphy, Kim sued to challenge the county line, which gave party leaders’ preferred candidates better placement on the ballot. During the court fight, Platkin offered his unsolicited opinion that the county line must go. Tammy Murphy later dropped out of the race.
Did this cause problems with Gov. Murphy?
“I think he’s been a tremendous governor, and I’ve been proud to serve him directly and him and his administration for almost the entirety of his time in office. He’s always been professional with me, and I’ve genuinely enjoyed the partnership,” Platkin said. “Obviously, that was a personally difficult decision, but one that you could look at now …  was the right legal outcome.”
Murphy told the New Jersey Monitor he has no hard feelings.
“It’s history. Matt’s done a hell of a job, in particular, I have to say, fighting the Trump administration, where he’s led with great force and stature,” Murphy said.
Platkin has joined or led at least 43 federal lawsuits against the Trump administration.

 Proudest accomplishments?
Platkin cited a number of actions as his proudest moments as attorney general, including his fights against Trump’s policies, his work against gun violence, and lawsuits against tech giants like Meta, TikTok, and Discord, whose platforms he alleges have fueled social media addiction among youth.
A gun violence reduction advocate since high school, he said his role as attorney general gave him the power to make change on the issue — and his two young children gave him the drive.
“I grew up in the Columbine generation. I thought we would have solved this problem,” Platkin said. “My daughter had her first school shooting drill before she could walk. Weeks ago, I got an email that they played Elmo in the closet to keep 2-year-olds from being too loud during a school shooting drill. That’s not normal. And that’s not Second Amendment rights.”
Platkin has defended New Jersey’s strict gun laws against challenges by the gun lobby, expanded tracking of gun carry applications, taken steps to better investigate gun crimes, targeted gun retailers, supported community-based violence intervention work, and more. He said all this has helped cut gun violence in New Jersey to record lows since statewide tracking began in 2009.
“We know that it’s not 9.5 million people engaging in gun violence. It’s like 1,000 people. So when you think about it that way, it’s actually quite a solvable problem, or at least a problem that you can reduce. And we’ve tried to focus on those people that we know are habitually involved in violence,” he said.
 What’s next
Platkin wouldn’t say much about where he’ll go after Jen Davenport, Sherrill’s choice for attorney general, succeeds him. But it won’t be politics, he said.
“I can tell you for sure I’m not running for office,” he said. “I find it kind of funny that people can’t imagine that somebody might do something because they think it’s right, not because it furthers a political narrative.”
He vowed to remain active in many of the battles he waged as attorney general.
“I didn’t start caring about these things when I took office in 2022, and I’m not going to stop caring about them in 2026,” he said. “In some way, shape, or form, I’m going to stay involved in these fights.”
Assemblyman Antwan McClellan (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Assemblyman Antwan McClellan (R-Cape May), who last year pushed for Platkin’s impeachment, called his legacy “a failure.”
McClellan pointed to prosecutorial missteps that resulted in the collapse of high-profile cases; Platkin’s numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration; his office’s lengthy, unresolved investigations that leave state troopers and other targets in limbo; and his decision to supersede the Paterson Police Department over the objections of its chief and the city’s mayor. The latter sparked a court fight that went up to the state Supreme Court, which deemed the state takeover lawful.
“It’s all chasing headlines, as opposed to grinding down and really doing the work that needed to be done and what’s expected from the attorney general of the state,” McClellan said.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Fifty-nine children died of caregiver abuse or neglect in 2024, according to an annual report from the Indiana Department of Child Services released Monday, just before the end of 2025.
Of those, 18 were due to abuse and 41 were due to neglect.
The total has stayed in a similar range in recent years — from a low of 50 in 2020 and a high of 61 in 2022. Last year’s number was 56.
DCS reviewed 276 child fatalities in 2024. The share of deaths attributed to caregiver maltreatment has hovered around 20% for at least the last several years.
The agency reviews all child deaths that involve allegations of abuse or neglect, and — for children under age three — all fatalities that are sudden or unexplained. Forty-two, or 71%, of the victims were under age 3.
Fifteen kids in the report were previously victims in a prior case of abuse or neglect substantiated by DCS.

Death by weapon, which includes body parts like closed fists, was the leading cause of death, listed in 20% of cases. Asphyxia, poisonings, drownings and unsafe sleep conditions were other top factors. DCS pulls causes of death from state death certificates.
Two cases involved toddlers shooting themselves with unsecured, loaded firearms — one in his mother’s purse and one by his father’s mattress. That is down from 10 similar cases recorded in 2023.
Parental alcohol and other drug use was prevalent, however.
Several young children died directly of acute cocaine, fentanyl or methamphetamine toxicity. But parents were repeatedly described as incapacitated by drug use in numerous cases with other primary causes of death, like a house fire, starvation or unsafe sleep conditions.
Some kids died after catching the common cold. Often, their parents didn’t seek medical attention despite noticing their children stopped eating, went pale, struggled to breathe and so on.
Other victims had chronic health conditions.
A 1-year-old boy, who’d previously been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and heart failure, died after going months without an overnight ventilation machine or medications prescribed to prevent fluid build-up in his lungs.
One 12-year-old girl with Type 1 diabetes died of diabetic ketoacidosis. Her blood sugar topped 600 on the day of her death. Investigators found a broken continuous glucose monitor and unused insulin pumps in the home, according to the report. The child’s medical records revealed the parents had a history of failing to manage her autoimmune disease even though they’d been through training more than 10 separate times.
Of the 78 alleged perpetrators deemed responsible for the fatalities, 63 — or 81% — were the children’s biological parents. Multiple perpetrators can be involved in one death.
The report cited a variety of caregiver stressors, like insufficient income, unemployment, substance abuse and a history of abuse — either as a victim themselves or as a perpetrator.
In 43 cases, or 73% of them, the children died at their own homes.

(Photo by Zoranm/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — A Tulsa lawmaker is pushing for a new law that would require public schools to begin conducting routine hearing tests for children in kindergarten through third grade in an effort to boost literacy rates.
But the plan has faced pushback from some state and national groups, who argue that while the hearing screenings would be beneficial, it’s critical that the state’s required guidelines adhere to best practice and be funded adequately so as not to harm local schools and businesses.
State Rep. Meloyde Blancett, D-Tulsa, said she filed House Bill 2188 last session after talking with pediatric audiologists in her district. She believes that undiagnosed hearing loss is likely preventing some students from succeeding academically.
“If you can’t learn to read by the third grade, then you can’t read to learn,” Blancett said. “It becomes a significant barrier to success in school.”
She’s pressing for Oklahoma to join the 70% of states that already require some type of hearing screenings for school-aged children.
While over 98% of infants are screened for hearing issues at birth, the testing cannot flag certain types of pediatric hearing loss, including late-onset or progressive, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, which represents over 200,000 audiologists, speech-language pathologists and scientists. 
Nationally, about 15% of children suffer from hearing loss when they enter school, according to the group. But failure to detect it impacts speech and language development and harms children’s academic, emotional and social outcomes, according to the organization.
Kim Richardson, a licensed hearing instrument specialist with more than 20 years of experience at Lucid Hearing in Edmond, said cost is a barrier that keeps many families from receiving early screenings and intervention.
Screenings cost from $250 to $350 if someone has to pay out of pocket, she said.
“Most insurance doesn’t cover hearing screenings, which is why people put them off,” Richardson said.
David Huff, Doctor of Hearing Care by Hugh, an Edmond-based business, said that hearing screenings are only effective if schools are properly trained in how to administer them.
“Screenings should happen, but schools must be equipped,” he said. “Without consistency across districts, the results become unreliable.”
How to properly conduct the screenings was a concern for five high-profile groups, including Hearts for Hearing, the Academy of Audiology, and the Oklahoma Speech-Language-Hearing Association. The groups opposed Blancett’s legislation during the 2025 legislative session.
While the three did not respond to requests for comment, Blancett provided a letter the groups sent lawmakers in February. They wrote that while they “unequivocally support the expansion of hearing screenings” using evidence-based screening models, they worried about the “significant, unintended negative consequences” of House Bill 2188.
Among those were a requirement to use a tablet-based program that the audiologists said is not consistent with “evidence-based methods recognized for childhood hearing screenings by nationally recognized clinic practice guidelines.” 
The groups also expressed concern about the financial burden to Oklahoma’s education system and immediate workforce supply challenges that would be required to accommodate increased testing and referrals. 
They also urged lawmakers to first study legislation passed in other states that already require such testing.
Blancett said it is unlikely that she’ll continue to pursue House Bill 2188 during the 2026 legislative session, which starts in February. But she said she’ll continue to press for student hearing screenings and will continue to work with stakeholders to develop best-practice legislation.
“There’s a critical need that’s not being met,” Blancett said. “My hope is that at some point, this gets across the line so we can give kids and teachers the resources they need.”

(Photo by Westend61/Getty Images)LINCOLN — With state government facing a $471 million budget shortfall, one state agency again seeks to use state lottery funds, through the Nebraska Environmental Trust, to help finance its operations.
The proposal was described by trust supporters as a new and probably unconstitutional “raid” of trust funds — state lottery proceeds that are granted out to environmental projects.
A state official, meanwhile, described the transfer as necessary to continue soil and water conservation projects and said it complies with a recently amended state law that expanded the allowable uses of the money.
The Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment (NDWEE), in a mid-budget funding request, seeks an $8 million transfer from the Trust, of which $6 million would be used for a soil and water conservation program and $2 million for salaries and administrative costs.
Board members of the Nebraska Environmental Trust made their annual grant awards in 2024. The grants were awarded early, in January instead of June, to allow organizations to begin work sooner in the year, officials said. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
Amanda Woita, a department spokeswoman, said the transfer to the Water Resources Cash Fund complies with the goal of the Trust funds — to conserve, enhance and restore the state’s environment, and that the Trust currently holds more than $70 million, so it can “easily” afford an $8 million withdrawal. The Trust typically distributes about $20 million in lottery-funded grants each year.
“Using these funds to protect the vital groundwater and surface water resources is a clear constitutional and common-sense use of the funds allocated to the Environmental Trust,” Woita said in an email response to questions.
But Kristal Stoner, the head of Audubon Great Plains, and Sandy Scofield, a former state senator who heads the Friends of the Environmental Trust, questioned the legality of the proposed transfer.
Stoner said using one-time Trust funds to help solve a state budget problem would “erode” the Trust and its purpose, which is to provide competitive grants to local and regional organizations seeking to enhance the state’s environment.
“I am deeply concerned,” she said in an email. “Continued diversions of funds will mean the end of the Trust.”
“Nebraska should continue to fund our legal responsibilities and basics of our government with general funds,” Stoner said, and not lottery proceeds.
Tight budget times
The proposal comes when the state is wrestling with closing a gap in the state budget and as supporters of the Trust worry about raids on the grant funds.


Explaining the Nebraska Environmental Trust
The Nebraska Environmental Trust was established when Nebraskans approved a state lottery in 1992. It receives 44.5% of the lottery proceeds — about $20 million a year in recent years.
Its stated mission is “to conserve, enhance and restore the natural environments of Nebraska.”
Grants are provided on a competitive basis, after a review and scoring by a committee of Trust Board members and then voted on by the entire 14-member board. The governor appoints nine board members. Five others are state agency heads, four of which are appointed to those posts by the governor.
Recent grant recipients include the Statewide Arboretum, various cities and towns from Omaha to Mullen, the Crane Trust, Ducks Unlimited, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, as well as the Audubon Society.


A year ago, the Legislature allocated $15 million in Trust funds, over two years, to soil and water conservation programs overseen by the Department of Natural Resources, an agency that recently was merged into the NDWEE.
State lawmakers, though, rejected a proposal by Gov. Jim Pillen to expand the use of Trust funds to include “outdoor recreation” and “healthy infrastructure.”
The separate Water Resources Cash Fund primarily finances projects by local Natural Resources Districts to enhance stream flows and groundwater recharge in areas of concern about water resources.
When it was created, the water program was financed using state tax dollars. But since 2011, Trust funds have been transferred in some years to supplement the state water cash fund’s annual grants, which totaled $3.7 million in the most recent year, according to an October report to the Legislature.
The NDWEE, in its budget request, said the $8 million in Trust funds would allow continuation of water resources programs in areas where water has been fully or overappropriated.
In recent years, the Trust, in a departure from past practices, has built up an excess of funds by not awarding all the proceeds it gets from the Nebraska Lottery. In 2023, for instance, it granted out only $11 million of the $20 million available. In 2024, $15 million was granted out of $26 million available.
This year, grant awards of about $18 million out of the $25 million available have been recommended by a Trust subcommittee, according to Holly Adams, the Trust’s executive director. The full Nebraska Environmental Trust Board meets Jan. 8 to consider approving those awards.
According to the Legislative Fiscal Office, the Trust holds about $73 million in assets, about $27 million of which will remain unobligated, once the proposed new grants are considered. Some of the Trust’s grants are multi-year, so funds for them are already assigned to grant out in future years.
Scofield, who was chief of staff under then-Gov. Ben Nelson when the Environmental Trust was created, said lottery funds were never intended to finance the administrative expenses of state agencies. She said the current budget “mess” has been caused by the state failing to provide enough tax revenue to finance state operations.
Some have blamed cuts in state income taxes passed by the Legislature in 2023 as too deep. The cuts are projected to reduce state tax revenue by $470 million in the current fiscal year and $702 million in 2026-27. Pillen, meanwhile, has said he anticipated needing to cut state spending and says state government should be reduced. He has called for $500 million in agency cuts this year.
Legal questions continue
Supporters of the Trust, who maintain that the latest proposed transfer is illegal, point to a state statute that says that grants from the Trust “shall not provide direct assistance to regulatory programs.”

But Woita, of the NDWEE, said that is a misreading of state law, and that recent amendments for the use of the Water Resources Cash Fund clearly allow its use to cover the costs of salaries and water conservation projects.
In May, a former state official, Jon Oberg, threatened to file a lawsuit to block the proposed transfer of Trust funds to the water resources fund proposed in the 2025 legislative session.
Oberg and another former state official, W. Don Nelson, who served as chief of staff under then-Gov. Bob Kerrey, have previously successfully blocked a Trust funding decision that they maintained was unconstitutional. Their 2020 lawsuit resulted in the removal of a $1.8 million grant to install ethanol blender pumps at gas stations.
But Oberg told the Examiner on Thursday that he had no comment about the most recent proposal. The proposed $8 million transfer will be considered by the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee during the 2026 legislative session, which begins Wednesday.

The walkout of UAW-represented nurses, physical therapists, medical assistants and maintenance employees at the clinic started July 2, centered on health care costs, wages and security for employees.
“When September came around we were still on strike,” Casiano recalled. “I was thinking to myself, What in the world is going on? Why would a company do this to their employees? Why would this even be allowed?”
He and fellow union members blamed federal labor laws. Casiano said they have “no teeth” and don’t hold employers accountable.
“That has to be changed at a national level,” Casiano said. “That’s what motivated me to get out there and run for Congress.”
The strike ended Nov. 3, when the clinic management and the union ratified a new contract. The agreement led to raises that were higher than nonunion employees received elsewhere in the Mercyhealth system, Casiano said, although still less than what the union had originally sought. Health care costs for employees will be “basically three times” what they were previously, he added.
“This was a big concession,” Casiano said. “Something I told the membership, this should be a wake-up call for everybody to vote for someone who’s going to do something about the health care crisis in our nation.”
Casiano argues that health care is a human right and government should do more to prevent health care costs from leaving people in debt or sending them into bankruptcy.
“If you have the money, you’ll get care,” he said. “If you don’t have the money, I’ve seen how many people end up being homeless or go into great debt because of their health.”
He supports Medicare for All, but also favors giving states greater freedom to regulate the health care systems. He opposes consolidation among health care groups and favors breaking up large hospital and health care systems, as well as keeping for-profit businesses, including private equity and venture capital firms, out of health care.
“The current system rewards profiting from people’s health care crisis,” Casiano said. “It is not a system of prevention and rewarding the best health care outcomes and practices.”
Casiano said that updating the 1930s-era National Labor Relations Act with laws that would strengthen the rights of workers to union representation is a top priority of his. If elected he would also seek to enact stronger federal laws against wage theft and against misclassifying workers as independent contractors with fewer protections. He said that he also wants “real tax relief to the working class” instead of the wealthy.
Casiano is one of five Democrats vying for the chance to challenge U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, the Republican incumbent in the 1st District now in his fourth term.
“I’m part of the working class. I’m not a lawyer. I’m not a politician,” Casiano said — although he readily acknowledged that every other Democrat competing for the nomination could make the same claim.
“Pretty much everybody running this time around, we’re all just working class people who want to see a change in the 1st District,” he said.
The rest of the Democratic field includes ironworker Randy Bryce, emergency room nurse Mitchell Berman, Racine community activist Gage Stills and university administrator Miguel Aranda.
As he shapes his campaign, Casiano is leaning into his background as a health care professional, a union activist and also a member of the Hispanic community.
He said the Trump administration’s round-ups of immigrants — which has caught up U.S. citizens in addition to people without legal immigration status — has a personal dimension.
“It’s sad that I, when I go to Milwaukee, can be stopped [by police] just because of the way I look and the way I talk,” he said. “At the national level, we’re attacking specific [ethnic groups of] people, which we’ve never done before.”
The 1st Congressional District has been solidly Republican since the mid-1990s. Steil succeeded Paul Ryan in the office when Ryan stepped aside  in 2018 after a 20-year tenure. A corporate lawyer and former Ryan aide, Steil won with margins of 9 to 10 points in 2022 and 2024.
The Cook Political Report has rated the district as likely Republican in 2026, and gives the GOP a 2-point advantage based on past presidential elections.
Casiano contends political apathy accounts for Steil’s success. “In the last election, many of my coworkers, they just did not go out to vote,” he said. “It’s not winnable, somebody told me [because] it’s all about the money.”
He contends that 2026 can be different.
“What’s changed now is the Trump administration and how messed up everything is going,” Casiano said. “Only people that have blinders on will say everything is OK, because it’s not.”
Casiano said he knows he’s a long-shot candidate, but he believes Steil is vulnerable and that people can be motivated to vote if candidates reach out to them.
“I know he has let down a lot of his constituents,” Casiano said. “We know he’s not out there for the farmers, or some of the small businesses” in the district, he added. “That’s the big message we’ve got to bring forward.”
He believes enough people have stayed away from the polls in the past to make a difference in the outcome for 2026.
“We have to go and start talking to Black and brown people in our community and get them out to vote,” Casiano said. “This is what I’m going to be fighting for.”

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden reminded lawmakers during his December budget address that state law “dictates” a minimum increase in education funding each year.
But in the next breath, he recommended flat funding for South Dakota schools.
During a press conference two days later, South Dakota Searchlight asked Rhoden to explain the contradiction.
“The same people that made the laws can suspend them, if you will,” he said. “And there’s times that it’s been necessary to do so.”
Lawmakers created the mandatory increase law in 1995, with an effective date in 1997. It required annual increases of 3% or inflation, whichever is less — an amount described as the “index factor.”
Legislators and governors followed or exceeded that requirement for 13 years. Since 2010, however, they’ve provided less than the index factor four times. Rhoden’s proposed budget would be the fifth.
How lawmakers get around the index factor
To get around mandatory funding increases, lawmakers amend the state education funding law. Instead of applying the mandatory increase to the prior year’s baseline funding, they reset the baseline. 
The mandatory increase remains in the law, but only as a requirement for the next year. When the next year arrives, if legislators want to go below or above the minimum increase, they reset the baseline again as needed.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said the index factor now serves more as a “guideline or a goal.”
“One Legislature can’t bind a future Legislature by statute,” Venhuizen said.


Dave Knudson was chief of staff to Gov. Bill Janklow when Janklow signed the mandatory minimum increase into law three decades ago. Knudson, who later served as a lawmaker, said the Legislature’s recent treatment of the law signifies a declining commitment to schools.
“It seems like education isn’t as high of a priority in these last few years as it was the prior 25 or so,” Knudson said.
1990s law changes made schools ‘very dependent on the state’
Janklow convinced lawmakers in 1995 to take more responsibility for school funding in an effort to reduce local property taxes. 
Knudson said the index factor was established because Janklow’s administration “knew state funding would have to be adjusted on an annual basis.” Three percent was close to the annual rate of inflation around that time, he said.
‘Not increasing is a cut’: Governor’s flat funding plan for education, health care worries advocates

Former lawmaker Lee Schoenbeck served in the Legislature then. He said there was an expectation that the index factor would provide what school districts “needed to have to operate.”
The changes implemented in the 1990s made schools “very dependent on the state,” Schoenbeck said, and put the onus on lawmakers to follow through with required funding increases.
“It ought to be a big deal to decide you won’t do that,” Schoenbeck said. 
During the roughly 30-year history of the index factor law, lawmakers have increased education funding by exactly the index factor 10 times and gone above it 15 times. They provided increases smaller than the index factor four times, including one year of widespread budget cuts when education funding was reduced.
Rhoden said during his budget address that education funding has stayed above the index factor over the long term. Since his predecessor Kristi Noem became governor in 2019, state education funding has grown by 27.9%, Rhoden said, while the index factor over that time has been 21.7%
Impact of sales tax reduction
Sandra Waltman, the South Dakota Education Association’s director of government relations and communications, said school districts set their budgets with the index factor as a guideline. Some enter into multi-year contracts with teachers based on the expectation.

Yet school leaders recognize it can be difficult to meet the index factor “in extreme times,” Waltman said.
“To ignore it consistently and have schools fall behind inflation is where we’d become concerned,” she said.
Schoenbeck said the state could live up to the index factor this year by immediately returning the state’s sales tax to 4.5%. The Legislature and then-Gov. Noem temporarily reduced the rate to 4.2% in 2023, costing the state more than $100 million in annual revenue. The tax is scheduled to go back up to 4.5%, but not until 2027.
“Put that back to where we had it and you’d have your problem solved,” Schoenbeck said. “Now these people in the Legislature will have to decide if they have the courage to pay their bills.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)I have an easy New Year’s resolution for Oklahoma lawmakers: Vow to reject any legislation in 2026 that creates do-nothing advisory boards. 
Pretty much every annual legislative session, senators and representatives pat themselves on the back for creating another government panel that seems to have no enforcement or regulatory power, much less do anything to make our state a better place.
Take the higher education Free Speech Committee, for example.
It’s been in the headlines recently because Oklahomans want to know what this body is doing about the fact that our state’s three largest universities have each been hammered with allegations of First Amendment violations, ranging from political and religious speech discrimination to press censorship.
Lawmakers created the board in 2022 to ensure that First Amendment rights are protected on Oklahoma college campuses, but gave it the power to only review policies and complaints and then make recommendations to universities on improvements to policies and free speech training. Chad Caldwell, who authored the legislation, has said the committee is needed because free speech matters continue to grow in importance, affect everyone universally and need to be protected.
But rather than being bastions of free speech, this nine-member board gives the sense that they have no sense of urgency to protect the First Amendment rights of university students and employees.
Instead of serving as a watchdog, this group has largely relegated themselves to the sidelines, opting instead to be cheerleaders, allowing universities to police themselves.
Meanwhile, our universities have faced serious free speech accusations.
A dispute at Oklahoma State University gained national attention after a staff member reportedly criticized a student for wearing a hat emblazoned with “No. 47” – symbolizing President Donald Trump’s second administration – while ironically giving a speech about free speech on campus at a nonpartisan event.
Leadership at the University of Central Oklahoma is facing accusations that they’re attempting to censor the press by stopping the print edition of their student newspaper, The Vista. The paper continues to publish digitally. 
And the University of Oklahoma is facing a dispute over whether a student, who received a failing grade after she cited the Bible in an essay about gender conformity in a psychology class, can claim religious discrimination. It has led the university to put two educators, including a teaching assistant who gave a student a zero for her work, on leave. The university, by the way, is now also facing accusations from a national group that they infringed on the rights of the teaching assistant. Just before Christmas, the university said that person who graded the essay was stripped of instructional duties.
As the Freedom From Religion Foundation put it, OU is a public university, which cannot privilege a certain religious viewpoint.
This state committee, meanwhile, has been largely silent throughout it all.
That raises concerning questions about whether board members actually know what they’re doing, and if they even could recognize a First Amendment violation.
During its most recent meeting, the Free Speech Committee only mentioned the OU dispute, which continues to play out, just before adjoining. The board chair asked the board if anyone wanted to address it as part of the board’s new business. Caldwell, who serves on the committee he helped create, commended the university for using the free speech processes in place.
Committee member Andy Lester also praised OU after the meeting, but lamented at one point that “it’s hard to balance these things.”
Indeed. But that, dear sir, is the onerous task this committee should be undertaking.
He also recommended that people pursue free speech complaints at the campus-level rather than with his committee because their “process takes some time.”
That’s not encouraging for people who deserve to have their First Amendment rights protected and enforced by what should be a neutral body or for our universities that deserve vindication if they did not commit a violation.
If this board is not equipped to quickly sort through complaints, why do it at all?
Caldwell said he supports it continuing to be an advisory committee. He argues they don’t need enforcement powers to force changes, and said that the committee was designed to be collaborative rather than adversarial with the universities it works with.
Board members have been busy combing through institutions’ free speech policies and making seemingly minor revision recommendations.
I question if this committee has the expertise — and willpower — needed to recommend changes that will strengthen free speech protections.
As an advisory board, they definitely don’t have the power to require needed change.
Which makes it a prime example of the ridiculousness of advisory boards and commissions.
So I hope as lawmakers begin drafting their 2026 legislation, they ask themselves if another advisory board will legitimately make lives better for their constituents.
If the answer is no, then let’s resolve in 2026 to take a hard pass on creating new ones and to seriously consider the continued need for those that already exist.

Local stakeholders say the project simply requires too many unacceptable impacts for the unique, and lucrative, outdoor recreation hotspot.
The post Backer of controversial Seminoe hydroelectric project proposes new tack appeared first on WyoFile .","The developer of a proposed pumped-water-storage hydroelectric project at Seminoe Reservoir has submitted a revised plan and asked federal officials to consider it as they evaluate the proposal and draft regulations. 
Utah-based rPlus Hydro says the alternative plan addresses a host of local concerns, including threats to critical bighorn sheep habitat and a destination trout fishery. Project opponents, and at least one state agency, say they haven’t had adequate time to evaluate the new proposal and remain unconvinced that it accomplishes that aim. 
The developer also filed a request in December with the state to certify water quality assertions made in its applications for federal licenses. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality will review and prescribe conditions related to “dredge-and-fill” activities associated with the project, according to the agency.
If built, the pumped-water storage system would generate electricity by pumping Seminoe Reservoir water uphill during daytime “off-peak demand” hours when wind and solar power are plentiful and wholesale electricity is cheapest, and then releasing that water back downhill through hydroelectric turbines during higher-demand hours in the evening.
Wildlife impacts, waivers and an alternate plan
The project is ultimately subject to federal approval and regulation, though which agencies should handle which aspects is still a matter of debate. Several state agencies and local government entities, meanwhile, also have roles to play as evaluators, commenters and advocates.

On the federal side, rPlus Hydro wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider its newly proposed “Alternative D” in the draft environmental impact statement for the project. The company, responding to an outpouring of concern and analysis from locals, says its newly crafted option would result in less heavy-truck traffic and a smaller construction footprint, reducing likely impacts to wildlife in the area, including a prized bighorn sheep herd.
“From a recreation standpoint,” rPlus wrote in a Dec. 15 letter to FERC, the company’s revised proposal “relocates the primary construction activities for the main access tunnel — including the batch plant and spoil pile — farther from the state park. As a result, recreational resources and visitor experiences are expected to be less affected than under [FERC’s currently preferred plan].”
Wildlife and outdoor recreation advocates have railed against the company’s request for a long list of waivers to timing stipulations designed to protect wildlife and habitat in the area. Likewise, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has objected to some habitat impacts that FERC appears willing to accept, including variance requests to override “timing stipulations for the crucial winter and [birthing] ranges,” Game and Fish wrote in a December letter to FERC. 
“Bighorn sheep have very specific habitat requirements which the minimization and mitigation measures proposed in the [draft plan] will not be able to adequately compensate,” the letter states. “Bighorn sheep habitat is irreplaceable.” 
rPlus Hydro’s new option is a welcomed effort, as well as an acknowledgement of threats to wildlife and recreation, Trout Unlimited’s Patrick Harrington said. But it doesn’t go far enough. The project would still disturb big game and other wildlife and chip away at vital habitat. The new alternative also doesn’t address potential impacts to the Seminoe and North Platte River fisheries.

“It’s a [public relations] strategy, not meaningful mitigation,” said Harrington, who serves as Wyoming governmental relations director for Trout Unlimited’s Rockies Region.
A major flaw in the proposed new alternative, Harrington added, is that it appears to shift much of the federal government’s mitigation planning for the project from FERC to the Bureau of Reclamation, which doesn’t have comprehensive authorities to address the myriad environmental and recreation impacts.
“This just creates an administrative loophole that makes permitting simpler,” Harrington said.
Existing wildlife timing restrictions, which are enshrined in the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Rawlins Resource Management Plan, increase the cost of construction, rPlus Hydro told WyoFile. The company is asking for waivers that are “narrowly tailored to allow construction to proceed efficiently.”
“Under the BLM Resource Management Plan,” rPlus continued in a written response to WyoFile inquiries, “seasonal activity restrictions would limit construction to roughly four months per year. This constraint would significantly extend an already complex, multi-year construction effort and require repeated mobilization and demobilization of crews and equipment, adding costs and inefficiencies that would make the project uneconomical to build.”

The public comment period for FERC’s draft environmental analysis ended Friday, before the agency formally responded to the company’s new proposed alternative. Trout Unlimited and several other entities, according to Harrington, are asking FERC for additional time to review and comment on the revamped proposal. rPlus Hydro “does not oppose” additional time for public review and comments, the company said. 
Without the benefit of formally reviewing rPlus Hydro’s proposed alternative, Wyoming Game and Fish reiterated to FERC its frustration with the federal agency’s draft plan. 
“We have articulated our concerns to the project proponent and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission through numerous exchanges,” Game and Fish Director Angi Bruce wrote. “And yet our most significant concerns, direct and in-direct impacts to the Ferris-Seminoe bighorn sheep herd and the fisheries of Seminoe Reservoir, Kortes Reservoir and the Miracle Mile segment of the North Platte River continue to be inadequately addressed or disregarded in the [draft environmental impact statement].”
Seminoe project
rPlus Hydro, and its subsidiary Black Canyon Hydro, propose building a 13,400-acre-foot reservoir in the Bennett Mountains overlooking Seminoe Reservoir near the dam — one of several reservoirs on the North Platte River.
Water from Seminoe would be pumped approximately 1,000 feet uphill to the new storage facility during the day when the market price for electricity is typically cheapest, then the water would be released through hydroelectric generators in the evening when daily power demand peaks, according to the companies. The facility could generate more than 900 megawatts of electricity when operating — slightly more than the generation capacity of the Dave Johnston coal-fired power plant, and enough to power roughly 675,000 homes.

The project also requires a new bridge and about 30 miles of new power transmission line connecting to PacifiCorp’s Aeolus Substation near Medicine Bow. The estimated cost ranges from $3 billion to $5 billion, and it could take up to five years to construct, according to federal documents.
“The project will bring substantial economic benefits to the local community and will serve as an important element of Wyoming’s modernized and reliable energy infrastructure,” according to the company’s website.
State’s review, and water quality
As stakeholders await word from FERC about its next steps, Wyoming DEQ has posted technical and modeling reports regarding rPlus Hydro’s request to the state. DEQ will host a public meeting from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Jan. 21, at Casper College.
Among other water quality considerations, the agency noted “discharges of water used for power generation may influence water quality in Seminoe Reservoir, the downstream Kortes Reservoir, and the segment of the North Platte River below Kortes Dam known as the ‘Miracle Mile,’ primarily with respect to temperature.
“This segment of the North Platte River,” DEQ continued, “is designated as an Outstanding Resource Water where the existing quality is maintained and protected.”

Trout Unlimited, as well as Friends of the North Platte and other groups, worry that a potential increase in turbidity and temperature may damage the fisheries, noting that trout, in particular, are sensitive to warmer temperatures. That’s a concern for local governments that rely on fishing tourism revenue.
“Any negative impacts upon the North Platte fishery, specifically the Miracle Mile, could have a devastating impact on our tourism industry,” Casper Mayor Ray Pacheco wrote in a draft letter to FERC.
The Casper City Council, joining Natrona and Carbon county officials, objects to FERC’s currently proposed path forward for the project. 
“This project will have a substantial impact on the health, safety, welfare, custom, culture and socioeconomic viability not just of Carbon County, but Natrona County and the City of Casper,” Pacheco wrote. “It is imperative that any potential impact this project has on hunting and fishing must be considered and properly mitigated.”
rPlus Hydro reiterated to WyoFile that it “takes seriously” and “recognizes the tremendous importance of fish and other wildlife to Wyoming and to the communities surrounding the proposed Seminoe Pumped Storage Project.”
The company noted that its own study concluded “that normal project operations, under typical conditions, would not harm Miracle Mile water quality or its fishery. rPlus has agreed to operational restrictions to ensure temperature thresholds are not exceeded and that the Miracle Mile remains fully protected.”
Conservation groups, including Trout Unlimited, are not convinced. All things considered, Trout Unlimited’s Harrington told WyoFile, the project appears to require so many environmental exceptions and acknowledged fish and wildlife impacts that it is simply a bad fit for the location.
“Energy and conservation are not mutually exclusive,” Harrington said. “We’re not against the project. We’re just proponents of fish and wildlife and the habitat that supports them.”
In addition to DEQ’s Jan. 21 public meeting, the agency is accepting public comments regarding water quality issues related to the project through Feb. 2. Written comments can be submitted via DEQ’s portal here, or mailed to Eric Hargett, Wyoming DEQ/WQD, 200 W. 17th Street, Cheyenne, WY, 82002.

Food insecurity is soaring in the state due to inflation and other factors, food relief experts say.
The post Wyoming spent $2.4M on hunger relief during shutdown emergency appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming spent $2.4 million to supplement hunger relief efforts in the state when the government shutdown left an estimated 26,000 state residents without federal SNAP assistance this fall. 
The money, which Gov. Mark Gordon released after declaring a public welfare emergency, was distributed to 81 mobile pantries, food pantries and the Food Bank of Wyoming. Distribution amounts ranged from $1,814 to the LaBarge Food Bank to $216,280 to Needs Inc. in Cheyenne.  
With the increased purchasing power, Wyoming’s network of food relief partners were able to distribute approximately 140,000 more meals statewide compared to the same period last year, according to a Department of Family Services report.
That number underscores what food relief personnel describe as a level of food insecurity they’ve never experienced before. 
It’s hard to say something like “all-time high” because there are holes in historic data, Food Bank of Wyoming Executive Director Danica Sveda said. But that’s what it feels like. “We are experiencing food insecurity on a much higher scale than I think anyone anticipated,” she said. 
The need for nutritious food had already increased to notable levels by summertime. The trend ramped up during the holidays, Sveda said. 
Gov. Gordon touted the SNAP-related hunger relief efforts in a recent press release.
“This effort reflects Wyoming at its best,” Gordon said. “State agencies, nonprofits, churches, and volunteers worked together to take care of our neighbors.”
He added a caveat, however.

“I’m proud of that work but I want to reiterate that this need has not ended with the restart of SNAP,” Gordon said. 
Hunger insecurity and SNAP
An estimated 90,000 people in Wyoming lack reliable access to nutritious, affordable food, according to the 2025 Map the Meal Gap from Feeding America. Additionally, 26,260 children live in food-insecure homes, the report shows, a 39% increase since 2019. 
As to what’s fueling growing needs, Sveda said, “it’s largely due to inflation. Grocery store prices are incredible right now, even for people who don’t face food insecurity.”
For families whose wages haven’t risen, she said, “the cost of food is really making families make hard choices.” Most other costs of living like utilities, rent and gas are inflexible, she said, so it’s the food budget that often takes the hit.

The federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, provides food benefits to low-income families to supplement their grocery budget. 
Around 29,000 people in 13,000 households receive SNAP benefits in Wyoming, according to the USDA. The average monthly benefit is around $386 per household. Children and seniors received the majority of the roughly $62 million in 2024 benefits. 
The Wyoming Department of Family Services distributes SNAP benefits on a monthly basis via reloadable EBT cards, which function like a debit card, for buying eligible food items.
As October’s government shutdown stretched toward November, the USDA announced plans to stop SNAP payments due to lack of funding. On the eve of the Nov. 1 SNAP lapse, Gordon declared a public welfare emergency, releasing state funds to prop up food assistance. 
Wyoming was unable to transfer state funds to SNAP recipients’ EBT debit cards. Instead, the executive order enabled the governor’s office to send discretionary emergency funds to charitable organizations and churches to provide food through food banks and pantries. 
A recent Department of Family Services report outlined how funds were disbursed and used during the period between Nov. 1 and Nov. 19, when Gordon’s order was rescinded.
“The funding allowed pantries to purchase a greater quantity and variety of items, especially high-demand proteins and fresh produce,” the report said.
Hunger relief programs served 74,000 individuals in November, a big jump from 53,000 in October, the report shows — “highlighting the increase in usage in November, which occurred during the federal government shutdown.” 
Rising needs
In the report, the Food Bank of Wyoming compared the November food spending of its partners to the same period last year. 
“Due to this increased purchasing power, partners were able to distribute approximately 140,000 more meals statewide compared to the same period last year,” the report said. “This dramatic increase underscores how essential this funding has been in stabilizing food access during a period of heightened need.”

The report also includes other data that indicate mounting food insecurity in the state. From September through November, calls to Wyoming’s 211 helpline related to food needs nearly doubled, the report states. 
Sveda, who spoke to WyoFile days after the Christmas holiday season ended, said that even with the buffer of emergency funds, pantries ran out of food, didn’t have enough volunteers to operate more than a few hours per week and experienced increasing numbers of people showing up for food assistance. 
SNAP benefits have resumed. Still, Food Bank of Wyoming and others are bracing for high demand to continue in 2026, she said. 
“We want to make sure that no one has to go to bed hungry, and that no one is malnourished because they couldn’t afford produce,” Sveda said. “And so looking ahead, we’re going to continue to work really hard to cultivate relationships with producers, farmers, ranchers and donors to make sure that we can keep doing this valuable work and make sure that we’re getting enough food out into the community.”

When everyone has health insurance, providers aren’t burdened with bad debt, charity care and overcrowded emergency departments, writes Barbara Sowada.
The post ‘Medicare for All’ can fix a broken system appeared first on WyoFile .","The current U.S. healthcare system is broken. 
The problem is bigger than affordability. Our system is a for-profit mishmash of disparate insurers and payment plans cobbled together in reaction to economic and political issues. The result is an increasingly unaffordable, ineffective, confusing mess, which frustrates patients, doctors and hospitals alike.

Opinion

The solution is “Medicare for All.” 
It would bring high quality, affordable care to everyone. You wouldn’t lose your health insurance if you lose your job, move, get divorced, age out, or make too much money. A catastrophic illness or injury wouldn’t plunge you into medical debt. It lets you choose your doctors and hospitals, improves your access to healthcare services regardless of where you live, reduces health disparities, and improves the health of individuals and our communities. 
Studies show that having health insurance is strongly correlated with more disease prevention, better chronic disease management, less infant and maternal mortality, and greater longevity.
Medicare for All builds on and expands traditional Medicare, which is well liked, to provide comprehensive benefits — medical, prescription drugs, mental health, dental, vision, hearing and long-term care to every person in the U.S. With everyone covered in the same plan, care is affordable. There are no insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs, copays, deductibles, coinsurance, surprise bills, nor network restrictions.
The benefits to doctors and hospitals are significant. With Medicare for All, a single-payer system, billing is standardized and streamlined, saving an estimated $40 billion annually. Providers are paid the same for the same service, instead of payment varying by geography and insurer. When everyone has health insurance, providers aren’t burdened with bad debt, charity care and overcrowded emergency departments.
Opponents claim Medicare for All is too expensive and would raise taxes. The fact is we cannot afford not to implement Medicare for All. America has the most expensive healthcare system in the world, an estimated $5.3 trillion was spent in 2024. 
Broken down, the average cost to insure a family of four was about $29,000 — $3,564 out of pocket, $6,296 in premiums and $19,276 in employer contributions, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker, which monitors the U.S. health system’s performance. 
In other words, those premiums are a kind of tax. Right now, we are all paying for each other’s health insurance. For instance, employer contributions are indirectly subsidized by us, paid for through higher prices when we buy the company’s goods or services, and are directly subsidized by the worker, through reduced compensation to offset what employers spend on employees’ health insurance.
The U.S. spends almost twice as much as comparable countries who have healthcare for all — $13,432 per person versus an average $7,393, using 2023 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data. Yet, our health outcomes are poorer by all major metrics. Here’s the kicker — 60% of U.S. healthcare costs come from tax dollars. Sixty percent of $13,432 equals $8,059 — still more than our counterparts pay for better healthcare. We pay much more because the U.S. is not a unified system but a conglomeration of competing, for-profit parts. Costs cannot be controlled in a for-profit system, only shifted. 
Motivated by quarterly growth, the U.S. healthcare system functions much like the children’s game of musical chairs. Insurers, big Pharma, hospitals and doctors compete with each other, expecting their profits to grow quarterly. Comparable countries keep their costs low because they are not motivated by quarterly growth, investor dividends and stock buybacks. 
Their healthcare systems are funded through some form of income-based progressive taxes, or a combination of progressive taxes and limited household contributions. Everyone is automatically covered and costs are controlled through a systemwide budget, known as a global budget, which unites all parts of the system and spreads the money equitably so hospitals don’t go broke, nor eliminate services. All communities, including rural communities, have access to necessary care.
You don’t have to be a fan of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders to see that his proposed Medicare for All legislation is a good step in the right direction — a move toward a single-payer system that provides comprehensive coverage to all Americans, regardless of income or health status. To control costs, Medicare for All must be explicitly a non-profit system, integrated by a global budget. It also must be adequately funded. Medicare for All, however, will not be welcomed by those who are profiting from the current system. They have the money to lobby Congress, and disinform the public, to maintain the status quo. If we want affordable healthcare, then Medicare for All is worth fighting for.
Piecemeal reform, whether at the state or national level, can only bring us more of the same: rising costs and diminishing returns.

(Getty Images)Idaho will receive nearly $930 million over the next five years to improve rural health care access and affordability. 
The massive federal tax and spending package approved in July included $50 billion for “Rural Healthcare Transformation” grants nationwide. 
Idaho on Dec. 30 was awarded nearly $186 million in annual grants to be distributed over five years to implement the plan outlined in its grant application, which focuses on five initiatives: “improve rural access to care through technology; ensure accessible quality care through innovative models; sustain rural workforce with training, recruitment, and retention; implement population-specific, evidence-based projects to make rural America healthy again; and invest in rural health infrastructure and partnerships.”  
“For many Idaho families – especially in rural areas – affordable, accessible health care is a real concern,” Gov. Brad Little said in a press release. “This investment, made possible by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, recognizes those challenges and puts resources where they’re needed most. It helps strengthen local health care and ensures Idahoans can get the affordable care they need, no matter where they live.” 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare submitted the state’s application with consultation from a task force convened by Little. 
The state will use the funds to provide subgrants to support the goals and projects outlined in its application. 
“A budget request will now go before the Legislature for federal funds approval,” the press release said, “and additional details about implementation will be shared as they become available.” 
 Idaho plans to use technology to improve rural access to care

The state’s application includes plans to conduct assessments on rural health care facilities to identify gaps, develop shared infrastructure among clients and to invest in equipment, software and training to expand telehealth options. 
The state plans to help procure mobile apps and online portals to help Idahoan patients for “self-monitoring, appointment scheduling, medication adherence, and coaching.” Investments in cybersecurity improvements, AI clinical tools, emergency system upgrades, and health management and analytics systems are also included in the plan.  
The goals to achieve by 2030 include increasing the number of facilities utilizing telehealth by 50%, increasing the percentage of physicians located in each of Idaho’s rural counties that are connected to the new Health Alert Network (HAN) to at least 80%, and increasing the number of appointments completed using telehealth or remote delivery modality by 50%.
 Idaho’s plan to use ‘innovative models’ includes diagnostic kiosks, workforce programs 

Idaho’s grant application outlines plans to deploy kiosks and pods in rural communities in places such as libraries, grocery stores and pharmacies where people may attend a telehealth appointment or receive mail-order prescriptions in lockers.
To address workforce shortages in rural areas, the plan proposes to further utilize health care professionals who aren’t doctors, such as emergency medical services, or EMS, responders. The plan said it may use funds to create designated locations where these professionals could hold in-person contact hours or offer apprenticeships. Funds would also be used to develop a Community Health Emergency Medical Services plan and allow trained EMS professionals to perform check-ups and wellness assessments in homes.
Funds may be targeted at recruitment, retention and training of EMS professionals. 
Goals include increasing the percentage of Idaho’s rural counties that have at least one county-level full-time equivalent paid EMS position from 28% in October 2025 to at least 97% by December 2030 and to decrease the percentage of emergency responses to repeat users (those who received services more than more than once in a year) from 32% in 2013-2016 to less than 10% by December 2030. 
 Funds may target incentives on medical education, training and retention in rural areas

Most of Idaho is rural, and the entire state is experiencing a significant shortage in doctors, especially in certain areas such as obstetrics and gynecology. The state does not have a public medical school in its borders, but it has some state-sponsored seats at the University of Washington and University of Utah medical schools. 
Both graduate and undergraduate medical students can do required training rotations in Idaho, and increasing opportunities for these clinic rotations in Idaho has been a focus of a recent task force looking to boost medical education in the state. 
The application includes financial incentives for doctors who commit to working in rural areas for at least five years, including signing bonuses and retention bonuses. There would also be money put toward health care education scholarships to students who would commit to serving in rural areas upon graduation, and support for physicians who train undergraduate or graduate medical students. 
Using the federal grant to support medical training in rural areas was an idea floated by the Idaho Medical Education Working Group, the Idaho Capital Sun reported in September. 
 Projects to deploy address chronic disease, mental health, maternal health 

Within Idaho’s initiative to “make rural America healthy again,” are projects to implement national standards and screening to try and prevent chronic health conditions, improve mental health and substance abuse treatment and address shortages in maternal and child health services. 
Projects include the National Diabetes Prevention program to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, and diabetes self-management education and support programs, as well as enhanced screening and education about Alzheimer’s and related dementias, and cancer, heart disease and other chronic conditions. 
Funds could be used for initial start-up costs for a pediatric psychiatry access line, so that pediatricians may be able to consult with child psychiatrists, according to the application. Other efforts could include providing space for mental health treatment in schools, expanding mobile crisis response teams and mobile medication assisted treatment for substance abuse, and to complete a needs assessment of maternal and neonatal care. 
Goals include decreasing the number of deaths from suicide, drug overdose, and alcoholism by 25% from 1,216 in 2023 to 912 or fewer by December 2030 and increasing the number of rural hospitals completing one or more new perinatal collaborative initiatives from zero to eight by December 2030. 
 Infrastructure investments may include equipment, vehicle and mobile screening units 

The planned investments in rural health care infrastructure include supporting renovations of facilities that would facilitate prevention programs, behavioral health treatment, dental and maternal health services. 
The funds could also be used to modernize facilities with the purchase of equipment such as MRIs, CT scanners, equipment for compounding pharmaceuticals and other items that would allow rural residents access to higher-level care without having to travel to a larger community. 
The application includes a plan to purchase mobile mammography units to offer breast cancer screenings in areas where they are not offered, and to help clinics and facilities retrofit vehicles to use for patient transportation. 
The application included a commitment to strengthen its partnership with the five federally recognized Native American tribes in Idaho, as well as to set aside 3.5% of its total grant to support tribal health care facilities and projects intended to improve services for Native American residents.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Candidates in a crowded Republican field vying for their party’s nomination to fill a vacant Arkansas state Senate seat already agree on many issues, from lowering taxes to supporting abortion restrictions — but they are especially united in their opposition to the 3,000-bed Franklin County prison project.
The GOP candidates facing off in a five-way primary Tuesday include a former member of the state House of Representatives, a gas utility community affairs coordinator and three businesspeople.
They’re hoping to serve the remaining term of a Republican lawmaker who was a vocal opponent of a project that has roiled this rural community 45 minutes from Fort Smith so much that one critic has placed placards and fake skeletons across from the prison site in protest of it.
Whoever wins the GOP nomination will go on to face Adam Watson, an independent, in the special general election held on March 3. If none of the candidates win an outright majority, the top two advance to a runoff Feb. 3.
The seat became vacant in September, after the death of Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch, who was among the lawmakers who voted against the prison’s construction when it was repeatedly rejected during last year’s legislative session.
Stubblefield’s seat has been the focus of a lawsuit over Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ decision to schedule the election for his successor in June. The move prompted complaints that the timing would have left voters without representation in this year’s legislative session, when the prison project is likely to come up. Sanders eventually moved up the election after being ordered to do so by a judge.
The candidates are:

Former state Rep. Mark Berry
Wade Dunn, a businessman
Brad Simon, a businessman
Stacie Smith, community affairs coordinator for Arkansas Oklahoma Gas
Ted Tritt, a businessman

 Prison 
The five candidates said in interviews and during a candidate forum in Booneville last month that they believed spending on the prison was irresponsible, citing issues obtaining water at the 815-acre site, lack of an available workforce and lack of input.
Berry, who represented House District 26 when the prison was announced in October 2024, said the prison issue has been “poorly handled” by state officials, expressing frustration with how he was informed about it. Generally, Berry was in support of building a new prison — just not in Franklin County, and possibly not as large either — and for increasing state spending on public safety.
“One thousand to 1,500 beds would be adequate, with the ability to expand that prison as we actually need it,” Berry said. He added that expanding Calico Rock was another potential option.
Dunn, who has been endorsed by Stubblefield’s family, criticized the surprise announcement of the prison site as “sneaky” and “underhanded,” before adding that he would never be in favor of it.
He also proposed an alternate location, saying Mountainburg, just off Interstate 49’s Exit 29, could draw on Fort Smith and the northwest Arkansas region for employees.
Simon said the state would be better off using that money to address the number of inmates who return to prison after being released, a root cause for the state’s prison bed shortage.
“We invest about $5 million a year on our reentry program,” Simon said. “We could spend $100 million on reentry programs, and it wouldn’t even be a drop in the bucket to what that prison’s going to cost.”
Tritt disputed there was an overcrowding problem. He said there needed to be a greater focus on providing additional support for people locked up for nonviolent crimes and those with mental health issues.
Smith said in an emailed statement that she could not support spending “$1 billion on a 3,000-bed prison when our state has so many other needs.”
Taxes and priorities
The Republican hopefuls sounded similar on other issues. The four who spoke at the forum cited lowering income or property taxes as a priority if elected, while also saying such cuts had to be fiscally responsible.
Dunn said, if elected, he would push to eliminate property taxes for veterans and those over the age of 65.
“They’ve contributed a tax base to the tax base for 40 years, paid for their homes, paid for their property, but they still have to rent it from the government,” Dunn said.
Simon said cutting regulations and taxes were his top priorities, along with reducing spending, arguing those moves would expand the economy.
Berry supported eliminating income taxes, especially the corporate income tax.
Tritt also agreed with continuing to cut Arkansans’ taxes. But he also said listening to constituents would be most important, because “people don’t feel like their voices have been heard” in Little Rock.
Tritt said he was also concerned with a recent Arkansas Supreme Court ruling that legislators can alter or repeal constitutional amendments passed by voters with a two-thirds majority in each chamber.
“We’re gonna have to have some fighters there [in the Legislature] that’s going to stand up for the Constitution,” Tritt said.
Smith said her top priority other than the prison was strengthening workforce development via “vocational training, apprenticeships, and partnerships with local businesses.”

We’ll be watching everything from health care reforms and support for the state’s foster children to economic development plans and policies that could shape the state’s energy economy for years to come.
The legislative session is a chaotic period for both news and the public. It’s when laws are made and priorities for the state’s government throughout the next year are set.
We at West Virginia Watch wanted to take some time here before session begins on Jan. 14 to prepare our readers for what they will see from us throughout the 60 days, explain how processes work and ensure they know what tools and resources exist to help them navigate the often confusing proceedings that are about to take place.
Please read on to help keep yourself informed about what we’re tracking over the legislative process and feel free to reach out to any of our reporters if you have questions about the legislative process, our work or anything else.

A quick rundown on how session works
Lawmakers are expected to gavel in for the first day of the 60-day session on Wednesday, Jan. 14. That evening, Gov. Patrick Morrisey will deliver his second State of the State address, where he will lay out the legislative priorities he wants to see lawmakers address throughout the rest of session.
Once session starts, any lawmaker in either the state House of Delegates or Senate can introduce bills they would like to see their colleagues consider. After being introduced in the lawmaker’s chamber, the bill will be referred to the committee process.
In the Senate, the process is simple: each bill is referred to at least one committee, where lawmakers will discuss it, invite testimony on it and introduce potential amendments to change it. If a bill is passed out of committee, it will return to the entire Senate for consideration.
In the House, new rules introduced last year restructured the committee process. There, bills are referred to more specific subcommittees that operate under the larger committee. For example, under the House Education Committee are subcommittees for educational choice, higher education and public education. Members from the larger House Education committee serve in smaller groups on the subcommittees.
Each subcommittee in the House will consider a bill for at least two days. The first day it is introduced in the subcommittee will serve as a “public hearing,” where members of the public and stakeholders either request to speak on bills or are invited by lawmakers to do so. Individuals should reach out to committee chairs for each subcommittee to request to speak. 
The second day is when lawmakers will markup and discuss the legislation at hand, offering amendments as they see fit. At the end of that process, they will recommend whether or not the bill should be passed by the larger standing committee. The overarching committee will hold its own public comment period and discussion and markup of the bill before voting whether or not to advance it to the full House for passage.
After going through the committee process, legislation introduced in both chambers will be reintroduced — usually on second reading — in front of the entire body they originated in. Lawmakers at this point can offer amendments to bills that must be approved by a majority of the whole chamber. After a third reading and if a bill is approved by a majority of lawmakers, it will advance; the House will send their passed bills to the Senate and vice versa for passage.
Generally, this process continues until both chambers agree on and pass the same version of the bill to send on to the governor for approval. Once received, he can either sign the bill, veto it or allow it to become law without signature.
There are, of course, exceptions to all of these processes — either the House or the Senate can vote to suspend rules and change proceedings with enough votes, for example.
Overall, it’s most worth watching a bill once it is assigned to a committee. That shows that the bill is gaining traction and at least has enough support from a committee chair to be discussed and featured on an agenda.
Keep in mind, there are thousands of bills introduced each year. Only some of those advance through the committee process and even fewer become law. For example, out of 2,460 bills introduced last session only 249 — just over 10% — are actually considered completed legislation, meaning they became law or were vetoed by the governor.
WHAT WE’LL BE FOLLOWING
School funding formula woes, paying for the voucher program 
Many lawmakers represent counties losing public schools due largely to West Virginia’s shrinking population. Seventeen school closures have been approved so far this year, according to an analysis from the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. Sixteen public schools closed in 2024.
Schools get less money from the state when there are fewer students in classrooms, spurring financial concerns as they try to serve those who remain. 
State lawmakers have floated the idea of changing the state school aid funding formula, which hasn’t been updated in years, to better serve counties that are dealing with declining student enrollment. Adjusting the complicated school funding formula could be challenging in the 60-day session window.

School superintendents last month told lawmakers that they’d like to see a funding increase in the formula for professional and service personnel salaries so they can retain necessary teachers and staff despite declining population. 
The funding formula also doesn’t account for special education services, which are costly to the school system. Special education students now make up around 25% of the state’s student population, according to the state school board. 
Lawmakers will also have to figure out how to pay for the Hope Scholarship, the state’s broad school voucher program, that is expected to cost around $230 million. Some Republicans have already raised concerns that the program cost is ballooning out of control, and House Democrats are expected to introduce bills that would put guard rails on how the money can be spent, like banning use of Hope funds in out-of-state schools. 
Morrisey, lawmakers want changes for troubled foster care system
Republicans in the House and Senate have already said they’ll introduce at least 16 pieces of legislation focused on fixing the state’s troubled foster care system. Several of the measures focus on beefing up accountability for Child Protective Services, including a measure that would require CPS workers to wear body cameras.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has touted improvements to child welfare under his watch, but lawmakers are still concerned about how the state is handling foster care cases for around 6,000 kids. 
Many of the measures would require funding.
Morrisey plans to work with the Legislature on one of the proposed bills that would create a fund to bring hundreds of out-of-state foster children back to West Virginia. The money would be used to open in-state beds in state-owned facilities. There are more than 300 foster children from West Virginia in facilities across the country.

Senate President Randy Smith wants to see data center bill challenges addressed, others may not
One of the largest pieces of legislation passed in the 2025 regular session was House Bill 2014, dubbed the Power Generation and Consumption Act. The law aims to recruit the establishment of data centers in West Virginia. It also allows for the creation of microgrids — relatively small power sources that are not connected to existing electric utilities. 
The law created a specialized tax structure for certain data centers and microgrids, meaning all but 30% of property tax revenues generated by the facilities is diverted outside of the community they operate in. It also stops localities from enforcing any zoning requirements or other policies against the developments, meaning local governments have no control in how they operate.
Several companies are currently attempting to construct microgrids and data centers throughout West Virginia. Residents in some of these communities have been outspoken against the developments, citing concerns over environmental and health impacts and lamenting the lack of local control their governments have over the facilities and the costs that could be associated with them.
It’s possible this session could see revisions to the data center and microgrid bill, in part due to these residents’ concerns.
Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, told his constituents in Tucker County in November that he had a “hard time” voting for HB 2014. As Senate president, he continued, he could have killed the bill but doing so would have been “hard” on his “political career” since it was a priority from Morrisey.
He said that “local control is a big issue” within the bill, and something that members of the state Senate “want to address.” 
At a news conference last month, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw was less direct about addressing concerns that have stemmed from the bill and the developments proposed following its passage. He said that, since it had been less than a year since the law went into effect, it was difficult to know the real impacts HB 2014 could have. 
“I’m sure that it’s among the things we’ll talk about when we convene next month,” he told reporters.
Meanwhile, Morrisey told reporters last month that he doesn’t believe concerns shared by locals who would be most affected by proposed data centers — and who have stood up consistently at rallies, public hearings, in lawsuits and more decrying them — are fair. He called them a “couple people” who were “engaging in scare tactics” and urged the public to instead celebrate how potential future proceeds from data center developments could help cut taxes.

School vaccination policy still unclear legislatively
Every year, lawmakers introduce bills to loosen the state’s strict school vaccination requirements. While states generally require school students to be vaccinated against several infectious diseases like whooping cough, polio and measles, West Virginia is one of only five states that do not allow families to opt out of that requirement for religious or philosophical objections. 
State law currently allows exemptions for only medical reasons. An executive order from Gov. Patrick Morrisey is at odds with the state’s school vaccine law, but he says the order is permissible under another law, the Equal Protection for Religion Act. A case at the heart of the debate is set to be reviewed by the West Virginia Supreme Court.
Last year, the Senate approved a bill that would have codified Morrisey’s executive order, but the House of Delegates ultimately rejected it. 
While some lawmakers have said they’d support or introduce bills that would put religious exemptions into state code or even get rid of the vaccine requirements altogether, the chair of the House of Delegates health committee told West Virginia Watch changing the school vaccine law is “not a priority” as the debate makes its way through the courts. Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, chair of the Senate Health Committee, said this session’s legislation should come from the House after delegates rejected last year’s bill. 
PEIA remains unstable
West Virginia state employees continue to face rising health care costs. The Public Employees Insurance Agency recently approved a 3% rate increase effective July 1 for state employees, local government workers and retirees who are on their health care plans. For state employees, a monthly spousal surcharge will increase by an average of $200 per month.
Last year, PEIA raised rates by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. Retirees also saw a 12% increase in premiums. 
The 2025 legislative session saw few PEIA-related bills. Morrisey last summer said he planned to call a special session to address the issues, but the session never materialized.

State employee pay raises as part of economic development
Morrisey has said his budget proposal will include raises for all state workers, but he’s not said how much. Morrisey told reporters he wants to work with state lawmakers on the proposal. 
“In my budget for fiscal year 2027, we will have a pay raise for state employees. Period,” Morrisey told reporters at a news conference Dec. 11. “That’s going to include teachers, that’s going to include school service personnel, that’s going to include our hard working state police and so many of the people — the correction officers — who are working hard every day to make West Virginia a better place to live, to work and to play.”
Republican leaders in the House of Delegates have proposed legislation that would increase pay for state teachers and school service personnel. 
State treasurer Larry Pack said he’s backing legislation that would have all teachers in the state making at least $50,000. Teachers who already make that amount should get a $2,000 raise, he said. 
House Republicans want to see more economic development overall 
At a news conference last month, Republicans in the state House of Delegates said they want to see economic development and job creation dominate their legislative agenda.
Specifics for the plan so far are relatively vague and they will likely remain that way until legislation is introduced showing details. The approach, House Speaker Roger Hanshaw said in December, will focus on three pillars: job training, workforce development and retention; investment in “job-creating businesses” and, lastly, practicing “responsible economic growth.”
Hanshaw said the state will see more resources put toward the aviation industry, both in manufacturing and operations. 
The House will also see the “Recharge West Virginia Act” introduced, which Hanshaw said will “support” local businesses in the state that increase their staffing.
Other legislation will be the TEAM-WV Act, an acronym meaning Technology, Energy, Aviation and Manufacturing. The act, Hanshaw said, is modeled under the same guiding principles of the nearby JobsOhio. In West Virginia, the potential bill would propose creating a “competitive, statewide” nonprofit to help form a more “cohesive” approach for developing sites for industry and growing partnerships between sectors.
Another attempt at Certificate of Need repeal 
For years, advocates and special interest groups have been lobbying the Legislature to repeal the state’s Certificate of Need process. Even after years of having a Republican supermajority control both chambers of the Legislature under Republican governors, they’ve been met with little luck.
Last year, that trend continued as legislation proposing to repeal the process again failed, this time laying bare a political power struggle largely between Morrisey and members of the House.
CON has been on West Virginia’s books since 1977. It’s a regulatory process, overseen by the West Virginia Health Care Authority, that requires entities looking to create or expand health care services to receive a legal document proving those new services fit an unmet need in the area.
Through the Health Care Authority, those interested in obtaining a CON receive technical assistance before applying to see what needs they are meeting. Services are approved through a needs methodology and different services — such as hospice care, ambulatory centers, clinics, private practices and specialty services — have different methodologies.
Morrisey announced during his first State of the State address last year that he wanted to see the entirety of this process repealed. He called it “big government activism at its worst” and said that repealing it would allow the state’s health care industry to “move toward the free market.”
But those who work in health care have been critical of removing CON laws as more than 75% of patients in West Virginia are government payers, meaning their health insurance comes from the Public Employees Insurance Agency, Medicare or Medicaid.

If CON is repealed, these critics say, there would be no guarantee facilities that come into the state would cater to these patients, as those programs reimburse less for services than private insurers.
Legislation to remove CON laws have been introduced annually for at least a decade. Most never gained traction. 
Last year, the legislation — HB 2007 — served as one of the first tests for Morrisey’s influence in the Legislature, and specifically among members of the House. Several lawmakers who held concerns about repealing the certificate of need process told members of the media, in interviews and elsewhere, that they did not appreciate the strategies employed by the governor and his staff while they attempted to whip votes in support of the legislation.
House Health voted down HB 2007 early last session, meaning it never went to the full House for consideration. While Del. Chris Anders, R-Berkeley, attempted to discharge the bill from the Health Committee and to the House floor for another vote later in session, he yet again failed as all but 16 members voted overwhelmingly to kill the legislation one last time.
It’s likely CON repeal in some form will again be up for consideration in the Legislature as it has been for the last decade. Specifics on the proposed policy, however, will only be clear once a bill is introduced.



There are several resources that can help the public stay on top of what happens at the Legislature every day and most can be found online at https://www.wvlegislature.gov/ Here are some quick tools you can use this legislative session:

Bill tracking: Using either the bill number, sponsor or keywords, you are able to search for bills that have been introduced during session and see where they are in the legislative process. This is a good way to see what bills have been introduced on certain topics or what issues certain lawmakers are tackling.
The Legislative Calendar outlines important days and deadlines to keep note of throughout the legislative session, including the last day to introduce new bills, when rulemaking should happen and more.
Bulletin Board: Checking this in the morning allows the public to access expected calendars for both the House and the Senate. Links to scheduled committee meetings are available for each chamber as well as the chamber calendars, which detail what bills are expected to come up throughout that day and where they are in the process.
WV Legislature Blog: Staff for the Legislature work each day to write brief blog reports showing what happened under the dome, from subcommittees to the chambers. This is a great way to stay up-to-date on some of the more policy-focused decisions made during session that may not always be covered by news outlets.
Activity Calendar: Over the 60 days, different organizations and groups will set up throughout the Capitol’s upper and lower rotunda hosting advocacy days. They are there to educate the public, meet with lawmakers and lobby for and against legislation to support their causes. The activity calendar lists what advocacy days are scheduled for 2026.
Contacting your legislator: Both the House and the Senate have complete lists of currently serving lawmakers on the Legislature’s website. These profiles include contact information for the lawmakers, their districts, what committees they serve on and bills they’ve sponsored so far in the session.

(Photo by Lora Wobbema/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s farmers are looking for higher profits but things may get worse before they get better, ag industry experts say. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture in December announced its Farmer Bridge Assistance, a payment program to help farmers survive what was a disastrous 2025 for many producers. 
North Dakota has set up its own loan programs to help farmers through economic hardship and to recover from storms that wiped out storage bins, making producers more dependent on short-term markets. 
Bank of North Dakota President Don Morgan said there is “prolonged stress” on the ag industry, and 2026 will likely not provide much relief when it comes to profits. 
He said the loans backed by the state-owned bank are not just meant to get farmers into 2026 but also into 2027. 
Morgan said the bank will help farmers with “as much as a working capital break as we can.” The bank is taking applications until June 30, 2026. 
The Bank of North Dakota allocated $37 million in loans to help rebuild grain storage and provide temporary storage. Another $300 million loan program aims to help farmers who lost money in 2024 and 2025. The bank also made available another $100 million in loans to help farmers pay for storing grain that has not been sold from the 2025 harvest. 
Bank of North Dakota commits $400 million ‘lifeline’ to ag producers

As of mid-December, the bank had funded more than 100 loans under those programs, with about 30 applications pending.
Looking at the big picture, Bryon Parman, agriculture finance specialist with North Dakota State University Extension, said the frequency of bailout programs for farmers raises concerns about deeper problems. 
“These ad hoc programs have started to become the rule more so than the exception,” Parman said. His comments came after the Trump administration announced the bridge payment program. 
“The fact that you need them over and over and over again, there’s some issues,” Parman said. 
Much of the blame for poor crop prices, especially in soybeans, has been blamed on the Trump administration’s trade war with China, a key market for North Dakota soybeans. 
But Parman said he saw signs of weakness in the ag economy even when farm revenue was high in 2022.  He said in that year, the rate of return on major assets and equity was relatively low to some previous boom years.
Parman said farmers are paying $10,000 and sometimes $20,000 an acre for land. 
But the land “doesn’t make all that much money, which, as an economist, doesn’t make any sense,” he said. 
Morgan said land values are being supported by large ag operations that are able to borrow more money, from out-of-state interests and the perception of scarcity. 
“They aren’t making any more of it,” Morgan said of farmland. 
Owning land that’s of high value does help a farmer’s balance sheet, Parman said, but high land values also make it hard for younger farmers to expand and be profitable doing it. 
Unlike drought years or other natural disasters, Parman said crop yields have been pretty good. 
“Prices have been an issue, but mainly they’ve been an issue because our costs are so high,” Parman. 
Federal ag payments address ‘crisis situation’ but trade still key, North Dakota groups say

Fertilizer prices are staying high in part because of competition for fertilizer from other parts of the world that are trying to improve their ag production, such as South America and India, Parman said. 
In addition, China, a major supplier of fertilizer, has been exporting less, he said.  
Mark Watne, who last year ended a 12-year run as president of the North Dakota Farmers Union, said he recently visited farms in Brazil and was impressed by their ability to increase production. 
Brazil’s advances in agriculture and soybean production have allowed it to fulfill much of China’s demand. That means China has become less reliant on soybeans from the United States. 
“Without even chopping down more rainforest, they can expand,” Watne said of Brazil  “So I think it’s worrisome. I think we may become more of a residual supplier (to China) than we really want to be.” 
One area of relief is declines in the prices of fuel and lubricants as well as lower interest rates, but are not enough to offset the increases in other categories. 
“Most major crops will see a cost increase of between 1.5% and 2% from 2025-2026,” Parman wrote in a November article published by NDSU  “While this would not be considered a large increase, given current crop prices, any increase at all will be difficult to absorb financially for many producers.”

(Photo: Benjamin Pounds for Tennessee Lookout)Seventeen years have passed since a massive rupture at a Tennessee Valley Authority plant spilled more than 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash into Harriman, Tenn., but the event is still raw in Jessica Waller’s mind.
Waller’s father, Ernest Hickman, a union contractor for Jacobs Engineering Group, worked on cleanup of the spill.
Hickman died of emphysema, which Waller attributes to his contact with the ash over a six-year cleanup period — specifically beryllium, a naturally occurring metal used in the nuclear, automotive and aerospace industries, and arsenic, which is used in metal, technology and some medical uses. 
Both are present in coal fly ash and are highly toxic.
She believes her mother, Patsy Hickman, also got ill from exposure after washing her husband’s clothes and other activities putting her in contact with the ash, causing her death of respiratory failure.

“It’s sad to know there’s a lot of people even here in Tennessee in the area who have no idea about the coal ash spill,” Waller said. “Or they do but they didn’t know the extent of the devastation that it caused, especially health-wise of making so many people sick.” 
Lunches on the coal ash
A dike at the Kingston Fossil Plant broke on the morning of Dec. 22, 2008, releasing 5.4 million cubic yards, or 1.1 billion gallons, of wet ash stored in the pond behind it. 
The ash, a byproduct of burning coal, spilled as sludge into the Swan Pond Embayment and Emory River and covered 300 acres, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Ernest Hickman was one of the first workers cleaning up the site, just one or two days after the spill. Hickman, Waller said, first worked in the spilled ash sludge keeping pumps running to suck it up. Later he shoveled it around to different locations including rail cars. His last month there was in April 2014 when the spill material “finally got from the mush to dust,” Waller said.
Coal ash contains 26 toxins including ones that cause cancer, are heavy metals or are radioactive. The workers’ training materials mentioned risks from arsenic and silica but not other risks from other materials like lead, cobalt, uranium, radium, lithium or molybdenum.
Waller said Jacobs didn’t allow respirators or masks and gave false information.
“(Workers) were told that you could eat a pound of it a day and it not even hurt you,” she said. 
TVA footed the bill for workers to have luncheons at tables underneath tents “right on the coal ash.” Wind, Waller said, blew the dust around, getting it in their food and drink.
“That’s because they trusted them,” she said of why the workers ate at these lunches. “And that trust was broken.”
“He would come home with his nose full of white stuff,” Waller said of her father during the ash cleanup. “He’d be coughing up black stuff.”
Jacobs Engineering settles Kingston coal ash case

Both of her parents, Waller said, started developing respiratory illnesses in the years after the cleanup, followed by her mother’s cardiovascular issues. She said her mother fell ill in 2014 and her father in 2016 and that their symptoms such as mini strokes “mimicked each other.”
“They got to where they couldn’t walk,” she said. “They couldn’t talk.” 
She got her father a sippy cup so that he could still enjoy Pepsi.
Ernest Hickman began “falling all the time.” Waller quit her job and delayed going back to school to be a licensed practical nurse to focus on caring for her parents instead. 
Ernest Hickman died on Dec. 4, 2016, and Patsy Hickman on Sept. 19, 2018. They were in their 50s; other Jacobs workers who died were younger.
“Question everything.”
“This was all covered in the ash,” she said in December, pointing to soccer fields near a historic marker in Swan Pond Sports Complex at the former spill site. 
Close to the 17th  anniversary, Waller placed her parents’ portraits next to another nearby monument, a cross meant to represent those including her parents, killed by toxins.
She is still worried about contaminants still in nearby bodies of water, and her grief flares near the holidays.
“I do have a hard time with Thanksgiving and Christmas,” Waller said. She still decorates a tree on Nov. 1 like her mother, whose favorite holiday was Christmas, did.
She remembers her father making drawings using his computer’s “basic paint program,” including one that included an image of the Earth describing Jacobs and another company, Bechtel, as doing “environmental cleanup around the globe.”

Waller didn’t conclude the ash was a cause for her parents’ illness until after her mother’s death. Then she went on a “binge” of research on ash toxins. She connected with Janie Clark, whose husband had worked on the spill cleanup and died. 
Waller met more spill workers and their families through a Facebook group. She compared her parents’ experience to that of others and then checked with doctors who’d treated other workers.
She said she got compensation from a lawsuit filed against Jacobs, settled in 2018 — Jacobs appealed the decision until 2023 — although she said the plaintiffs were “let down” by how long it took. Since then she’s told her story as a way to handle her grief he’s told her story for two years which she said helped her handle her grief for her parents and anger at TVA and Jacobs.
Waller said she hoped people could learn to be more skeptical of people in power and big corporations.
“Question everything,” she said, adding she likes to get second opinions in her nursing work.
Coal ash, she said, despite current talk of reviving the coal industry,  is “definitely not safe” and that moving it around will “contaminate everywhere.” 
She and Clark talk at least once per week.
“Nobody understands the type of grief that we are dealing with,” she said of herself and Clark. “We were the ones that witnessed the suffering.”

Democrats have controlled both chambers of the state Legislature since 2019. They currently hold a 43-22 majority in the House and a 23-12 advantage in the Senate. One more vote in each chamber would give Democrats a rare two-thirds supermajority in both houses.
Partisan primaries will be in June, though many will be uncontested. In Colorado, unaffiliated voters can choose which party’s primary to vote in. Primaries with multiple candidates tend to occur in seats where the current lawmaker is term-limited or decided not to seek reelection.

(Photo by Chad Riley/Getty Images)Idaho’s endowment forests are often the subject of passionate public conversation, and that is a good thing. These lands support Idaho’s public schools and other institutions and are managed – by Idahoans – with care and scientific rigor. 
Who benefits from the state’s school endowment fund? Idaho students or the forest products industry?

A recent op-ed about Priest Lake includes several misconceptions about how the Idaho Department of Lands (IDL) and the State Board of Land Commissioners (Land Board) manage these trust lands. As stewards of Idaho’s endowment lands, we want to set the record straight. 
The endowment assets are managed as a unified trust with the Endowment Fund Investment Board managing the financial assets and Idaho Department of Lands managing and protecting the land assets. Both entities are under the supervision of the Land Board. 
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands is clear-cutting “senescent forests” and converting them into tree farms.

FACT: The term senescent forest refers to stands in a state of biological decline. IDL does not manage endowment forests to reach senescence. As a trust land manager, IDL maintains forests in productive, healthy, actively growing conditions to ensure long-term revenue and ecological resilience. Regeneration harvests, including clearcuts in appropriate locations, are recognized, science-based silvicultural tools that help restore young, vigorous stands while protecting soils, water quality, and wildlife habitat for the long-term.
IDL is not converting forests into “tree farms.” Our forests are managed for long-term sustainability, ecological function, and consistent revenue for beneficiaries. 
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands has adopted a blanket 40–45 year timber rotation, similar to timber management on the West Coast.

FACT: This is an oversimplification. While IDL does use the Forest Projection System (FPS, developed by the Forest Biometric Research Institute) as one of several tools for forest growth modeling, rotation ages are set based on site productivity and inventory data from field measurements and LiDAR analysis, not an arbitrary timeframe.
In Idaho’s diverse landscape, high-productivity sites may reach commercial maturity in around 35 years. Others may require 85 years or more.
Most endowment forest stands fall somewhere between.
Rotation age is determined by site-specific biological growth, sustainability modeling, and long-term revenue considerations — not by a single statewide target.  
 MYTH: Timber harvests on endowment land are not sustainable or cannot support long-term revenue.

FACT: Sustainability is built into the trust mandate. Idaho’s endowment forests are managed under a sustained yield framework, ensuring that harvest levels remain stable over time, forest health is maintained, and timber revenues continue for future generations of beneficiaries.
Many Priest Lake stands are harvested after reaching maturity following timber harvests or stand replacing wildfires from decades ago.
 MYTH: Revenue from endowment lands is only intended for public schools, and contributions are “token.”

FACT: Public schools are the largest beneficiary, but not the only one. By law and by trust structure, endowment lands support:

Public schools
Agricultural College
Charitable Institutions
Normal School
Penitentiary
School of Science
State Hospital South
University of Idaho
Capitol Permanent Fund

Endowment lands and funds form a unified trust corpus, established by the United States at statehood. The state of Idaho — through the Land Board as trustee — has a fiduciary responsibility to manage these assets for all named beneficiaries.
Revenue from timber currently represents over 90% of annual income from land management, but Idaho’s endowment also includes 1.5 million acres of other revenue-producing lands and a highly diversified investment portfolio managed by the Endowment Fund Investment Board (EFIB).
The fund’s performance is among the strongest and most transparent public land trusts in the country.
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands is “putting all its eggs in one basket” by relying on timber and acquiring additional timberlands.

FACT: This characterization misrepresents Idaho’s trust structure and investment strategy.
The land portfolio is increasingly diversified through commercial leasing, land exchanges, strategic acquisitions and limited dispositions.
EFIB manages a diverse, high-performing financial fund that mirrors private-sector best practices
Timberland acquisitions are guided by long-term expected returns, not short-term conditions.
Idaho’s combined land and financial assets form one of the nation’s most disciplined, well-managed trust systems.
Land dispositions over the last decade have produced approximately $330 million dollars. Of this, about $100 million has been reinvested in 54,000 acres of productive timberland, $144 million reinvested in financial assets, and $85 million available in the Land Bank which can be used to purchase more profitable lands or transferred to the financial asset. 
 MYTH: Engineered wood products will replace traditional timber markets, making Idaho’s forests less valuable.

FACT: Engineered wood products still require high-quality fiber, something Idaho’s managed forests are well-suited to produce. Traditional lumber and engineered wood rely on different grades and types of timber, and IDL forests contribute to both markets. These evolving markets strengthen, not diminish, the economic value of managed forests.
 MYTH: Idaho Department of Lands logging is the primary driver of soil erosion and phosphorus levels in Priest Lake tributaries.

FACT: This conclusion is not supported by comprehensive landscape evidence.
The area around Priest Lake has seen substantial residential development, which also influences nutrient loads and water quality.
Historic U.S. Forest Service management up through the 1970s–’80s involved intensive harvests visible in Google Earth time-lapse imagery — activity that predates current conditions.
IDL applies stringent best management practices, stream buffers, and slope protections based on Idaho’s unique soils and terrain, meeting or exceeding Forest Practices Act requirements.
Any evaluation of phosphorus or sediment trends requires watershed-scale analysis that accounts for all land uses, not just selective interpretation of a single tributary.
In conclusion, Idaho’s endowment lands exist to provide permanent, long-term support for Idaho’s public institutions. IDL’s management is built on science, sustainability, transparency, and constitutional fiduciary duty. The challenges facing these forests — wildfire risk, changing markets, population growth, and ecological stress — require thoughtful, strategic stewardship. 
That is exactly what IDL is committed to delivering.

(Photo courtesy of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library)Federal policies on health care and trade are likely to continue to color North Dakota’s biggest government stories in 2026. Congress and the Trump administration are spending money in an attempt to help the rural health care system and farm economy to offset cuts to Medicaid and declining ag commodity prices.
It’s also an election year, featuring ballot measures and a U.S. House race in North Dakota. And the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library plans its grand opening in conjunction with the nation’s milestone 250th anniversary.  
Special session
Gov. Kelly Armstrong has set Jan. 21 as the date for a special legislative session to allocate federal rural health funding that was part of what Republicans called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in 2025.
North Dakota was awarded $199 million after applying for its share of the federal funding. One North Dakota policy change prompted by the competition for federal funding was prohibiting the use of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy candy and junk food. The new restrictions are expected to be implemented by September 2026. 
North Dakota receives $199 million in federal grant for rural health care

North Dakota’s application for funds from the Rural Health Transformation Program focused on four areas: workforce; preventive care and healthy eating; bringing high-quality health care closer to home; and improving health care technology.
Once lawmakers gather at the Capitol, they could propose bills addressing other issues. But legislative leaders have said they plan to limit the scope of the session, and rules require that a two-thirds majority in each chamber must agree that the topic should be considered.
Election
North Dakota’s only U.S. House seat and a potential statewide vote on making school meals free for students are likely to be the top races in 2026, but there are many more. More than half of the Legislature’s seats are up for election, and there are local races for seats on school boards, judgeships and other positions. 
U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, a Republican in her first term, plans to run for reelection and has already received President Donald Trump’s endorsement. Republican Alex Balazs, who came in fourth out of five candidates in the 2024 primary but received the state party endorsement, has announced plans to challenge Fedorchak.

Other statewide offices  — all held by Republicans — on the 2026 ballot are secretary of state, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, tax commissioner and two seats on the Public Service Commission. 
The statewide nonpartisan offices up for election are the Superintendent of Public Instruction and two seats on the state Supreme Court.
In the Legislature, odd-numbered districts are on the ballot and two even-numbered districts, 26 and 42, have elections for House seats. The primary is June 9.
North Dakotans may be voting on state funding for school breakfasts and lunches, something the 2025 Legislature voted down. Organizers still need to turn in signatures to get the issue on the general election ballot. 
Voters will consider during the primary election a ballot measure to require all proposed amendments to the state constitution to comprise a single subject. 
The Legislature also approved putting two measures on the 2026 general election ballot. Measure 1 proposes to make changes to term limits voters approved in 2022. The measure would allow lawmakers to serve up to 16 years in one chamber and clarifies that a partial term does not count toward the limit. Measure 2 would require that 60% of voters approve a measure instead of a simple majority. 
Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library
The grand opening of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library is set for July 4 in Medora, coinciding with the 250th birthday of the United States.
All living presidents are invited to the grand opening, said Matt Briney, spokesperson for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation. However, they may not attend on the opening weekend and instead arrange a time to see the library before the year ends. 
President Trump has not confirmed whether he will attend the library opening, Briney said. July 1 is highlighted on a national calendar of 250th events to celebrate the library’s grand opening.
Members of Theodore Roosevelt’s family are planning to camp in the area during the opening weekend, and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who is also a library foundation board member, plans on attending the library opening, according to Briney. Among public officials expected to attend is Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who championed the library project as North Dakota governor.
The state has high hopes for attracting more tourists to the town of fewer than 200 people with the museum dedicated to Roosevelt, who ranched in the Badlands before becoming revered as one of America’s greatest presidents.  
Energy 
As the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, North Dakota relies on oil and gas taxes for more than half of its revenue. Production has held relatively steady, though the price of oil is struggling to stay above the level forecast by the state. 
North Dakota oil production resilient even as prices have declined

Industry observers will be watching to see if a couple of carbon dioxide gas sequestration projects — Minnkota Power’s Project Tundra and the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline — will move forward. 
Sequestration is permanent underground storage of the greenhouse gas. Minnkota would sequester CO2 from a coal-fired power plant while Summit would gather CO2 from ethanol plants in five states, including one in North Dakota. While in the works for years, construction has not started on either project. Summit, which has faced regulatory challenges, has indicated the possibility of changing the pipeline route, but also has said a North Dakota storage area “remains an important long-term asset for the project.” 
Meanwhile, hearings on a controversial high-voltage transmission line are coming up in January. There is high interest in a pipeline to bring natural gas from western North Dakota to the east, though construction won’t start until 2028. There could also be headwinds for wind and solar energy as the Trump administration cuts incentives for green energy projects. 
Potential efforts to extract critical minerals from coal, lawmakers’ study of nuclear energy’s feasibility in the state and the ongoing discussion surrounding data centers are also likely to be major energy topics in 2026.
Agriculture 
The farm economy took a beating in 2025, and 2026 isn’t looking so good, either. A major factor will be export markets. China has been a key importer of North Dakota soybeans in years past but did little buying in 2025. 
Depressed prices for soybeans and other crops coaxed the Trump administration into aid payments for farmers, which should arrive in February. Former North Dakota Farmers Union leader Mark Watne questioned whether those payments would be enough to keep farmers afloat.
Construction will continue in 2026 on two giant milking operations for Minnesota-based Riverview in the Red River Valley. There is a lawsuit pending against the state for its permitting of the Herberg Dairy near Hillsboro and other legal challenges to the Abercrombie Dairy north of Wahpeton. 
Beef production was the bright spot for North Dakota agriculture in 2025, and despite some ups and downs, could be again in 2026 as consumer demand remains strong despite higher prices.

I’ve lost track of the number of lawsuits filed to force the federal government to do what it is legally required to do. Political violence is at an all-time high. And the animosity across the aisle continues to grow, even though lawmakers of different backgrounds, communities and ideologies have more in common than they think. Division and otherization have become the norm.
Unfortunately, the word unprecedented has been used so often that it feels less like something new or never done before and more like Tuesday.
I think it’s finally time to retire “unprecedented.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Now, don’t get me wrong—I’m not harkening back to the “good ol’ days.” As someone who has spent their entire career in and around Lansing politics, I know that the secrecy, political jabs, lack of transparent information and lack of communication are nothing new. I know that the policy process is slow, and long legislative session days occurred even under single-party control. And not everything that happened this year was bad. We saw historic investments in school funding targeted to Michigan students who need it the most and support for 100,000 babies born over the next three years, helping them start off strong. We saw compromise, as members across the aisle and across the chambers worked together to improve policy and mitigate harm. 
But the good was vastly overshadowed by the onslaught of “unprecedented acts”.
So as we turn to 2026, we have a few resolutions that we think policymakers in Lansing should adopt.
First and foremost, mitigate the harm. Hundreds of thousands of Michiganders stand to lose health care coverage and food assistance due to the cuts included in the harmful federal megabill passed earlier this year. Even more will fall through the cracks due to complex federal rules and regulations and confusing paperwork. To be clear, these cuts do not mean savings for the states—they mean job losses, provider closures and higher food and health care costs for all 10 million Michiganders of every age, of all incomes and in every part of the state. The state must do what it can administratively and through budget decisions to reduce the negative impacts to the extent possible.
Get a balanced and equitable budget done on time. Families all over the state are struggling with the high cost of housing, groceries, utilities and child care. Michiganders deserve to see a doctor, put food on their tables, safely send their children to schools and reach toward economic security. School districts and local governments need to plan what services they’ll be able to continue providing. Our state budget is a moral document, and it needs to prioritize meaningful investments in Michigan’s people at a time when they need it most.
Pass evidence-based, data-backed, people-centered policies. As an organization rooted in data, we follow the numbers to determine whether our policy decisions are moving the needle on outcomes for Michiganders. We are also an organization that is informed by the community, and we know that ensuring the voices of those who will be most affected by policy change and budget decisions is a vital part of the policy-making process that is often missing. Consistent policies combined with sustained investments in what we know works are necessary in order to improve outcomes for Michigan’s kids, families and workers.
The Michigan League for Public Policy has been around since 1912. In that time, we’ve weathered economic ups and downs and shifted with political swings, but we’ve remained steadfast in our dedication to the issues Michiganders value most. Instead of policy decisions that divide us, we should be centering our family, friends, colleagues and neighbors in these conversations. And that would be truly “unprecedented.”

(Photo: NC Newsline)For nearly a quarter century, when debates over voting laws, gerrymandering, or money in politics enveloped North Carolina, Bob Phillips has been in the thick of them. That era ends this month, when Phillips retires from day-to-day advocacy work. 
As the leader of Common Cause North Carolina since 2001, Phillips has helped to shape anti-corruption laws and organize support for voting rights. He has worked with other groups like the League of Women Voters, Democracy NC, and the North Carolina NAACP to remove obstacles to voting, increase government transparency, and try to overturn election districts they argued were unfair.  
Phillips has been a constant presence in the Legislative Building, in courtrooms, and at rallies. And during his tenure, Common Cause NC has gone from a small, nearly invisible operation to an organization with statewide reach. 
Last January,  an online town hall Common Cause sponsored about Judge Jefferson Griffin’s efforts to throw out more than 60,000 votes in his race for a seat on the state Supreme Court drew more than 600 participants from around the state. Thousands of people gathered in the cold to attend its rallies to protest trashing votes in that close race. 
Phillips, with his typical modesty, doesn’t take credit for the group’s rising profile. He credits the organizers Common Cause has across the state and in the office with deepening the grassroots and making concrete what can be heady topics. 
“We still have a presence at the legislature in lobbying the decision-makers, but we’ve also invested a lot in organizers,” he said. “That’s probably the secret sauce in connecting people.”
Common Cause President and CEO Virginia Kase Solomón said Phillips has built a talented team in North Carolina and an atmosphere where they can do their best work. 
“Whether you’re a volunteer or a staff person, he figures out what your superpower is, then he lets you go and run with it. He’ll put you forward,” Solomón said. 
Mitchell Brown worked with Common Cause NC when he was a student at A&T State University in Greensboro in an effort to increase student turnout for the 2010 elections. He credits that work with his interest in voting rights. Brown went on to attend law school at NYU and is now senior voting rights counsel at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. 
“Bob is a very important reason why I’m a voting rights attorney today,” he said. 
When Phillips came to Common Cause after years as a reporter and then as spokesman for former Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker, he already had deeper knowledge than most about how the legislature works. He says partisan politics were not as toxic as today. 
Politics in North Carolina has undergone a tremendous shift in the last 25 years. Republicans have taken firm control of the legislature and have enacted laws such as voter ID, which the organization opposed. 
“It has changed dramatically,” Phillips said.  “I jokingly say sometimes the worst day I had in the first 10 years on the job would maybe be the best day today.”

And it’s hard to win a gerrymandering lawsuit these days. State and federal courts say it’s not their job to referee partisan redistricting. 
In fact, Common Cause North Carolina is etched in legal redistricting history. It was a case that went to the U.S .Supreme Court, Rucho v. Common Cause, that resulted in the court saying it would not consider complaints over partisan redistricting. The “Rucho” in the case is former state Sen. Bob Rucho, who now sits on the North Carolina Board of Elections. 
Still, Phillips looks back on some significant wins. 
He counts same-day registration, which allows people to register and vote on the same day during the early voting period, as a victory the organization helped secure. North Carolina passed same-day registration in 2007, the first southern state to do so. 
Though Common Cause NC is nonpartisan, Republicans deride it as built to aid Democrats. It’s true that Common Cause has sued Republican leaders many times in recent years over redistricting plans. Leading Republicans, including House Speaker Destin Hall, ridicule the strategy as ‘sue until blue.”
However, Phillips said its positions are centered on principles, not partisan politics. 
For example, Common Cause NC helped push campaign finance and lobbying laws through the legislature in the mid-2000s despite initial opposition from Democratic House leadership, Phillips recalled. Democratic House Speaker Jim Black was under investigation for accepting illegal campaign contributions, and the measures were inspired by reports of his activities. Black was later indicted and sentenced to prison. 
Though its push to have an independent group draw election district lines is now seen as a Democratic issue, it’s something Republicans wanted when Democrats were in control, Phillips recalls. 
Back in 2007, Republicans, then in the minority, sponsored bills to create an independent redistricting commission. Among the sponsors were current Senate Leader Phil Berger, a Rockingham County Republican, and former state Reps. Tim Moore and Thom Tillis, who went on to serve as House Speakers. 
Democrats in the legislature buried those bills. 
Independent redistricting is all but dead in North Carolina today, and after a series of friendly rulings by conservative courts, Republicans are exercising their considerable freedom to draw districts for partisan advantage. 
It wasn’t that long ago that the declaration from a former House Republican redistricting leader that a congressional plan had 10 Republican seats and 3 Democratic seats only because they couldn’t figure out how to draw an 11-2 map drew gasps and made headlines. 
Now, partisan advantage is a clearly declared goal. 
“They were just blatantly open about it,” Phillips said. 
Phillips says Republicans are disguising racial gerrymandering, which is still illegal, as partisan gerrymandering, which the Rucho decision allows.
Common Cause NC lost a federal lawsuit over legislative and congressional districts this year. It and other plaintiffs claimed new lines are racial gerrymanders, while Republicans asserted they used no racial data to create the new districts. 
“Unfortunately, we’re at a time where many of the courts buy that,” Phillips said. 
After Phillips returns from a long vacation, Solomón has asked him to come back to an advisory role for the national organization.  
“”He’s someone whose advice and wisdom and strategic thought-leadership and knowledge base I was dreading the idea of losing,” she said. 
Phillips said he has tried, and he hopes Common Cause will continue, to help promote civility in elections. 
“Everybody wants to see our elections being more civil affairs than they are,” he said. “Can we suddenly, with a coalition, make that happen? Probably not. But we can get more people thinking about what’s needed in holding the folks that are running for office accountable.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BobPhillips_redis-featured.jpg,,,2026-01-05 06:12:12.123764

Because the Capitol is closed and vacated for a $300 million multi-year renovation, the House and Senate will meet in a temporary building that was constructed next to the Capitol Annex. 
Other state offices, including the governor’s and Supreme Court’s, have been moved elsewhere in Frankfort. 
Public will be on the outside as Kentucky legislature convenes in temporary quarters

The temporary legislative chambers have no in-person accommodations for the public. Some open government advocates have raised concerns about the lack of public galleries, saying it could distance Kentuckians from the proceedings. However, Republican legislative leaders said building galleries would have been too costly an addition for a temporary structure. 
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear voiced criticism of the lack of galleries in mid-December when asked about plans for an alternative rotunda space. In the Capitol, citizens and officials often gathered in the rotunda for rallies and other events. 
The governor said the Capitol Education Center, a visitors center, had been “altered to try to create the largest meeting space possible” as an alternative to the rotunda. The center sits atop the parking structure next to the Capitol Annex. 
“So, this meeting space will be close by, we believe will be safe, and is the best alternative that we have, Beshear said. 
As for the lack of galleries in the House and Senate chambers, Beshear said, “You could have put in bleachers. You could have put in just extra seating areas, simply by moving a wall back in some area, but that wasn’t included in their design.”
Also different this year, Beshear will deliver his State of the Commonwealth Address Wednesday at the Thomas D. Clark Center for Kentucky History in Frankfort. The speech before a joint session of the House and Senate has traditionally been delivered in the House chamber of the Capitol.
Who can enter temporary chambers?
Answering questions via email, Legislative Research Commission (LRC) spokesperson Mike Wynn said that legislators, legislative staff and credentialed reporters will have access to the temporary chambers. Lobbyists will not.
Wynn added that a few Annex committee rooms — rooms 149, 154, 169 and 171 — will be open to the public as viewing rooms while lawmakers are in session in the next building. The rooms will have live video feeds of the proceedings in the House and Senate. 
“Anyone wishing to access the temporary chambers must enter through the Annex and use the walkway that connects the Annex to the temporary chambers,” Wynn said. “The main entrance of the temporary chambers is located next to the Rose Garden.”

People with an LRC-issued badge can enter the Annex via the front doors or the tunnel that connects the annex to the parking garage, Wynn said. People with disabilities may use an ADA entrance at the rear, southeast corner of the Annex. On busy days, LRC may activate the front doors near the Floral Clock on the west end of the building. 
The temporary structure is connected to the Annex by a walkway. Security officers will be at each end of the walkway, inside the doors, Wynn said. Lawmakers have offices in the Annex.
Wynn told the Lantern that those wanting to reserve an Annex committee room for an event, like an advocacy group, should follow buildings on the LRC’s website. The Finance and Administration Cabinet will still oversee requests for events on the Capitol’s campus, he added.
Also missing from the 2026 session will be some student pages. The General Assembly will not host its day page program, Wynn said. Students from across the state participate in the program, visiting the Capitol and their lawmakers for a day while learning about the legislative process. 
“The General Assembly will continue to offer a constitutional page program, and the House will offer opportunities for students to participate in the legislative process through House Standing Committees,” Wynn said. 
Full-time pages are high school students, typically juniors and seniors, who serve throughout the entire legislative session. 
New addresses for constitutional officers
As for Kentucky’s other branches of government, the judicial and executive branches have also moved out of the Capitol during the renovation and to temporary offices in Frankfort. 
The Kentucky Supreme Court is at 669 Chamberlin Avenue. Additionally, the Supreme Court Clerk’s Office and the State Law Library are on Chamberlin Avenue. 
Beshear and his staff are in the Old Governor’s Mansion and State Office Building on High Street in downtown Frankfort. Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman’s office is at Berry Hill Mansion.
Republicans Attorney General Russell Coleman and Secretary of State Michael Adams are neighbors. The AG’s office is at 1024 Capital Center Drive, while the secretary’s office is at 1025 Capital Center Drive.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Boosting Rhode Island’s share of funding to K-12 public schools could relieve some pressure on municipal property taxes, according to a commission calling for an overhaul of the state allocation to local school districts.
The group convened by the Rhode Island Foundation found the state only covers about 38% of K-12 education spending, an amount Foundation CEO and President David Cicilline called “really low” when compared to other states.      
“If we don’t get this right and ensure that every student in Rhode Island has access to a high-quality public education to prepare them for a pathway into either higher education or a career, the future of our state is really in jeopardy,” said Cicilline, a former U.S. representative and Providence mayor at a December press briefing ahead of the report’s release.  
The foundation’s Blue Ribbon Commission released recommendations in a report Monday, proposing that the state redo what constitutes “full funding” for municipal school districts, by incorporating costs such as transportation and teacher pensions into the state’s funding model. In addition, towns and cities would also have a clearer idea of their own fiscal obligations to their schools. 
“I think most states are moving towards a system where the state assumes greater responsibility,” Cicilline said, partially because poorer communities often have a harder time generating the revenue needed to effectively fund their schools.     
The commission suggested that a 58% state share would result in an increase of about $600 million a year in education spending.
Under the proposed changes, the total “foundation cost” of K-12 education, as the commission labels it, would be about $2.9 billion. State spending would rise from roughly $1.57 billion to $2.16 billion and the municipal share would fall from about $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion.

The 63-page report is the product of the Blue Ribbon Commission, which was established in December 2024 and co-chaired by Cicilline and Nora E. Gordon, a Georgetown University professor of public policy. The commission’s members included superintendents, union leaders, advocates, charter and public school officials, plus a youth working group of Rhode Island students. Brown University’s Annenberg Institute served as research partner and facilitator and prepared the final report. 
The commission’s four big recommendations are meant to work in tandem and would need to be pursued as a complete set of reforms, rather than a piecemeal approach.

Edit the funding formula so that the state covers a much wider range of K-12 costs, rather than focusing too much on instructional costs.
Tweak the formula’s weights to determine how different students’ needs are served, such as students with disabilities, multilingual learners, and students with economic disadvantages.  
Require municipalities to have a minimum local contribution to their schools, based on the town or city’s property wealth, rather than the current suggested share.
More requirements for transparency in local school finances. The report notes: “Dollars come to districts regardless of how the district has spent past dollars, what student outcomes it is achieving with those dollars, or how transparent they are about the use of funds.” 

“What is occurring right now is that we have some students in the state of Rhode Island with a full bucket who are fully funded, and we have some students who are not,” said Brenda Santos, Annenberg Institute director of Rhode Island research partnerships and networks.
The commission also sketched an alternative wherein the state would maintain its approximate 38% share of local education funding, while still retooling the formula itself. In this scheme, municipalities would pay about $300 million more if all districts were to be fully funded.
Cicilline said lawmakers could write the new formula into law without immediately increasing the state’s overall K-12 spending. The state could phase in a higher share over several years, he suggested, as the budget allows. 
An aging formula for state aid 
The state’s current funding formula was first crafted by lawmakers in 2010 and instituted the following school year. As a recent legislative summary phrases it, “The core principle behind the formula is that state funding should follow the student; therefore, the distribution of state funds changes annually based on shifts in enrollment.”
In the commission’s view, however, not enough money follows students. The present formula’s “core instructional amount” provides municipal funding largely for teacher salaries and direct classroom costs. So that “core” amount, Santos and Cicilline told reporters at the December briefing, often ends up inadequate. 
Santos offered the example of in-district transportation costs as something that shocked the youth working group, who were flabbergasted that the state does not subsidize busing for public school students. 
“You cannot educate a child that’s not in the building, “ Santos said.
The commission also took mathematical umbrage with how the current formula combines child poverty rates and property assessment values in its calculations. It noted Rhode Island is the only state to crunch the numbers in this specific way, can lead to uneven funding in places where high property values coexist alongside high child poverty. 
The commission suggests relying solely on the property tax base to reflect a more accurate minimum contribution. The report’s third recommendation — to mandate a local minimum share of education funding — is meant to curb towns and cities whose local contributions have stagnated even as state aid and property values have increased. 










You cannot educate a child that’s not in the building.


– d Brenda Santos, Annenberg Institute director of Rhode Island research partnerships and networks


Santos said the revised calculation is a way to ensure “every single city in town is paying the same rate under this proposed system.” 
“So no one is a winner, no one is a loser,” Santos said. “There are no advantages for any district or any city or town like there are under the current system.”
She gave the example of Portsmouth, which currently gets about $3 million in state formula aid that would disappear under the new model. But the new model would also provide about $5 million for costs Portsmouth is paying locally, so the town would be about $2 million better off overall.
Pensions past and future
Pursuing either the 58% or 38% funding scenario would funnel state money in the following ways:

In-district transportation, school safety, career and technical education (CTE) costs, building maintenance, and early childhood screening are not included in the current funding formula and are kept afloat by municipal expenditures. The Commission recommends the state contribute to these costs.
The state already splits with municipalities the payments for out-of-district transportation, certain special education expenses, and the pensions of teachers who are already retired. The commission recommends that the state absorb these costs in full.

Right now, both current and retired teacher pensions sit outside the formula and are split 40/60 between state and local funds. The commission thinks that the future pensions of current teachers should be absorbed into the core funding amount like any salary cost, while the state should shoulder alone the pension liability for already retired teachers, “a cost completely unassociated with current students who are in school,” Santos said.   
The pension ask would eventually subside on the retiree side. In recent and upcoming fiscal years, the state has paid over $400 million for retired teachers’ pensions, but Santos said that state actuaries calculate that by 2036, the liability will fall sharply because of how the current benefit plan is structured.

State officials and legislative leaders were briefed on the commission’s report ahead of its release, and its recommendations are likely to become a topic of discussion at the State House when the legislative session begins anew in January.     
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said over a recent email that state representatives “look forward to carefully reviewing the report during our upcoming legislative session.” 
“A strong educational system is essential in making sure our students are well prepared for the rapidly-changing 21st century economy and is a critical component of our state’s future prosperity,” Shekarchi said.    
Senate President Valarie Lawson, also who serves as the president of the teachers’ union the National Education Association Rhode Island, is still reviewing the final document, according to spokesperson Greg Paré.
Paré said the commission “raises important issues” the Senate will soon explore this legislative session, and he added that the entire Senate is scheduled to receive a presentation on the report from the Foundation on Jan. 15. 
Gov. Dan McKee said in a an email that his administration “will carefully review their recommendations as we work with education leaders, the General Assembly, and communities to ensure our funding system is fair, transparent, and aligned with student success.”

(University of Kentucky photo)If you smoke and want to quit, call the national quit line at 1-800-784-8669 to speak with a confidential coach. 
In what could be a “game changer” someday for Kentuckians with small cell lung cancer, the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center has treated the first patient in the country with a novel drug currently in the early stages of human trials. 
Markey is the first site to open a U.S. trial for ZG006 (Alveltamig), which has three “arms” (trispecific) to grab cancer cells and connect them to T cells, a type of white blood cells that are key in fighting pathogens and disease. 
It has the potential to give years of life back to small cell cancer patients, for whom other therapies have been ineffective in many ways — only about 40% of patients responded to tarlatamab, an immunotherapy with two “arms” (bispecific), for example. 
Dr. ​​Zhonglin Hao, a professor of medicine and the co-leader of Markey Cancer Center’s thoracic oncology program, said small cell lung cancer usually occurs in patients with a history of smoking, with the exception of a “very small proportion.” 
This population typically undergoes treatments that are on the market right now, but their cancer often comes back.  
“When they recur, that’s when we need more options,” Hao said. He described the three-arm therapeutic approach like this: “When they are dragged together, the lymphocytes can kill the cancer cell.” This can extend and save lives, he said. 
His trial will enroll three dozen patients over the next few years. To qualify, patients need to have extensive stage or limited stage small cell lung cancer and need to have experienced a recurrence of their cancer after receiving first line chemotherapy, Hao said. Patients in the trial receive the therapy via infusion in a hospital setting every two weeks.  
Hao’s team treated the first patient in the trial in late October. That patient “has tolerated it well without any appreciable side effects,” he said. 
If this trial proves “promising,” Hao said, he will launch a second tier trial and be able to “take a larger number of patients, in terms of hundreds of patients.”  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in Kentucky, despite its robust screening system. Kentucky has the second-highest rate of smoking in the nation — behind only West Virginia. 
In 2022, 17% of adult Kentuckians smoked, significantly higher than the national rate of 11%. The rate of new lung cancer cases, too, is higher than the national average — 84.1 per 100,000 people in Kentucky compared with nearly 52.8 per 100,000 nationally, according to the American Lung Association’s State of Lung Cancer. 
“Everybody will be tickled if we can make the bispecific, trispecific work for more people,” Hao said. “Our goal … is to cure them … despite having … that kind of disease.” 
​​Meanwhile, Hao said, patients should seek treatment as early as possible. 
“A lot of times geography is a hurdle, a barrier for referral,” he acknowledged. “But I want all our community and college to think and to suggest (to) patients: Come to UK early and in order to have that potentially curable therapy.” 
This new treatment may also be effective in treating brain metastases, which is when cancer cells migrate to the brain. This is common in small cell lung cancer, according to UK. The first U.S. patient treated with ZG006 at Markey had brain metastases, Hao said. 
“This disease has a very high chance of coming to the brain,” Hao said. “Once they come to the brain … it’s oftentimes too late to handle it, so we’ve got to think about just starting immunotherapy as soon as we (can).” 



Who should get screened for lung cancer? 
According to the American Lung Association, people should get screening for lung cancer if they are 50-80 years old, currently smoke or did smoke in the last 15 years and smoked a pack a day for 20 years or two packs a day for 10 years. People who fit that criteria are “high risk” for developing lung cancer, according to the association. 
People can also email the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services’ lung cancer screening program at LungCancer@ky.gov with questions about screening. 
Kentuckians who believe they qualify for the UK trial can contact the Markey Cancer Center.

Charlie Dent and Jim Greenwood endorsed Shapiro in 2o22. “Republicans, behind closed doors, acknowledge that.[...]","Gov.

(Photo courtesy of PAcast)In just over 300 days, Pennsylvania voters will decide whether to reelect Gov. Josh Shapiro for a second term.
Shapiro, a Democrat, has been on a steady upward political trajectory for more than 20 years without an electoral defeat. After this year’s governor’s race, the former Pennsylvania attorney general, Montgomery County commissioner and state representative is widely expected to set his sights on the party’s nomination for president in 2028.
Voters next year will judge Shapiro on his record of running the commonwealth. While Republicans say there’s plenty to criticize, such as three late budgets and lingering questions about a sexual harassment scandal involving a top aide, Democratic and Republican political experts say his appeal to a broad swath of voters is undeniable.
“Josh Shapiro is easily the most popular governor we have had in a long time. This is a guy that Democrats love, Independents love,” said Lehigh Valley-based GOP consultant Sam Chen, noting a group of prominent Republicans including former U.S. Reps. Charlie Dent and Jim Greenwood endorsed Shapiro in 2022. “Republicans, behind closed doors, acknowledge that.”
After nearly three years in the governor’s office, Shapiro’s approval record hit an all-time high in October, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll. His consideration as a running mate for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 elevated his profile nationally. 
And the governor’s race is expected to strongly influence down-ballot races, meaning the Democrats’ one-seat majority in the state House, the Republican three-seat majority in the Pennsylvania Senate and perhaps as least four U.S. House seats are believed to be in play this year. 
“Politically, Josh’s victory is very key to what’s going to happen from a policy standpoint in the commonwealth and in the nation,” Philadelphia-based public affairs executive Larry Ceisler said.
Shapiro’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Pennsylvania state Treasurer Stacy Garrity (Capital-Star photo)
Shapiro’s likely opponent in November is Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a retired U.S. Army officer and business executive serving her second term as the commonwealth’s financial manager. 
An ally of President Donald Trump, Garrity has positioned herself as a champion of the people during her five years in office. She touts the Treasury’s success in returning hundreds of millions of dollars worth of unclaimed property held by the state to its rightful owners and expanding access to educational savings programs.
Garrity’s campaign plans to make the case that while Shapiro has broad approval, it’s based on a carefully crafted public image. Voters will change their minds when they see beneath the surface, Republican strategists said.
“It’s a mile wide and an inch deep,” Garrity campaign spokesman Matt Benyon told the Capital-Star. “There’s very little intensity to it. It provides us an opportunity to tell the other side of the story.”
On Dec. 23, the campaign released a video styled as a movie trailer for a dark techno-crime thriller with references to a 2011 Philadelphia stabbing case that Shapiro took over when he was state attorney general. The tagline: “It’s amazing what you can learn … when you hide in the shadows.”
Before the case was transferred to the attorney general’s office in 2018, Philadelphia officials had initially determined that Ellen Greenberg’s death was a homicide before changing it to suicide, despite the presence of more than 20 stab wounds on the 27-year-old teacher’s body.
When the medical examiner said in October he no longer believed Greenberg died by suicide, Shapiro said he stood behind the conclusion the AG’s office reached that the evidence points to suicide. He also expressed regret that his office could not provide better closure for her family.

Garrity’s campaign will also make an argument that Shapiro’s narrative of success is belied by Pennsylvania’s national rankings of its economy, education system and transportation infrastructure.
“Pennsylvania is lagging behind,” Benyon said. “What Josh Shapiro does with seemingly every breath he takes is blame President Trump.”
Republican Party of Pennsylvania spokesman James Markley said the GOP will attack Shapiro over what it says is a lack of transparency surrounding the resignation of Secretary of Legislative Affairs Mike Vereb amid a sexual harassment scandal that resulted in a $295,000 settlement with Vereb’s accuser. 
The administration said during litigation over a Right to Know Law request for emails around the time the accusation was lodged that the accuser’s email account was deleted in accordance with records retention policies.
The GOP, Markley said, also plans to highlight what the party claims is a lack of transparency around security upgrades to Shapiro’s own Montgomery County home after the April firebombing of the official Governor’s Residence in April. Shapiro and his family were asleep there after celebrating Passover the night before when a Harrisburg man, at odds with the governor’s position on the war in Gaza, threw two Molotov cocktails into the state reception hall. 
Cody Balmer pleaded guilty in October to attempted murder with a sentencing enhancement for terrorism and will serve 25 to 50 years in state prison. The administration has said the improvements stem from reviews by Pennsylvania State Police and independent security experts “to pinpoint security failures, review protocols, identify gaps and make concrete recommendations for improvement to the Governor’s security.”
“If he doesn’t have anything to hide, then why is he fighting so hard to block all of this information from being released to the public?” Markley said.
Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy and administration at Penn State Harrisburg said those issues offer an opportunity to question Shapiro’s judgment and character, but they may not register with voters in the way Republicans want. Mallinson noted they didn’t affect Shapiro’s popularity in real time.
“Most people aren’t as polarized. They just want the government to work and things to go their way,” he said.
Chen said those issues might also present pitfalls for Garrity, noting that Shapiro gets sympathy as the victim of an anti-semetic attack and voters may feel it’s reasonable to update security after such a breach. Likewise, Vereb was a Republican when he served in the state House before becoming one of Shapiro’s close aides in the attorney general’s office.

“You’re walking on very thin ice if you’re going to use that as an attack,” Chen said. 
Shapiro’s image is that of a governor who has proven his ability to competently run a government, who has pushed for investments in education, agriculture and transportation. And while he hasn’t achieved all of those policy goals, Mallinson said Shapiro has put himself at the center of compromises and willingness to entertain proposals from those further to the left and right of him.
Mallinson said the three late budgets on Shapiro’s watch might be an angle where he is vulnerable to criticism. Although a monthslong delay of his first budget was due in part to the collapse of a school voucher deal with Senate Republicans, in each case the divided legislature has shared responsibility, Mallinson said.
Democratic strategist Neil Oxman said Shapiro has figured out how to work with the Republican Senate 
“He understands better than anyone, probably since [Ed] Rendell was governor, that when the Democrats and Republicans each control houses there has to be some give and take,” Oxman said.
Shapiro has also leveraged losses into political capital by demonstrating that he is fighting for constituent groups. 
“Whether or not he can get mass transit [funding] for Philadelphia and Allegheny County, just the fact that he’s fighting for it shows voters he’s fighting for them,” Oxman said.
And although Shapiro has many policy issues to figure out, such as surging energy demand and prices in the face of the AI race, Ceisler said Shapiro’s demonstrated ability to work across the aisle provides a foundation to continue negotiating.
“For all the acrimony and delay, he’s done a good job,” Ceisler said.
And while the budget delays in 2023 and 2025 that extended into the fall each year caused real disruption and expense for school districts, county governments and nonprofit organizations, the vast majority of Pennsylvanians weren’t directly affected. 
Last year, the weight of the late state budget was compounded by the record 43-day federal government shutdown, which resulted in hardship for many federal workers. That may have had a detrimental effect on faith in government generally, Mallinson said
“My bigger concern is that it affects their view of government and the ability to get things done,” he said. “If you’re a voter who is not just turned off from voting by that … at the end of the day, you still have two options and you have to pick one.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shapiro-snap-updates--1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 05:56:54.544346

Annual statistical reports kept by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) reflect a sad tale. Over 12,000 residential customers have been lost in the past 14 years in Kentucky Power’s 22-county service area in Eastern Kentucky. In 2010, Kentucky Power sold 3.3 billion kilowatt-hours of industrial power.  By 2024, that number dropped to 2 billion kilowatt-hours  a 38% loss. No doubt, our region is in trouble. 
Most people living in Eastern Kentucky do not need numbers on a chart to tell us that industries once depended on to feed our families have declined or, worse yet, completely evaporated. Coal, steel and power, the bedrocks of our communities and local economies, have gone by the wayside. 
Kentucky Power itself was a major player in declining power and coal jobs when it chose to decommission its Big Sandy 2 generating plant in Louisa and invest millions of Eastern Kentucky ratepayer dollars in the coal-burning Mitchell plant located just outside of Moundsville, W. Va., a plant that does not  employ Kentucky citizens, pay Kentucky taxes or burn coal mined in Eastern Kentucky.  
So here we are, looking for new industries to attract to our area and hoping the industries and businesses we do still have stay. None of this is for the faint of heart. To their credit, economic development teams across the region are aiming to create sustainable growth, foster innovation and improve the quality of life in their communities. Adding another 15% to the industrial electrical rate, which is already one of the highest in the state, is not helpful. 
More is needed, much more than just decently priced industrial electrical rates to attract and maintain industries and businesses providing good-paying jobs. Infrastructure is key as well. 
As they say in the real estate market, our area of Northeast Kentucky has good bones. We have two major waterways, the Big Sandy and the Ohio River; rail services and three major highways that pass through our area: Interstate 64, US 60 and US 23. We are minutes away from the AA Highway, a throughway to Northern Kentucky and the industrial Midwest.  We have regional airports nearby. Yet, we have failed to keep up. 
Our electrical grid needs work. Extreme weather events due to climate change — hurricanes (the effects of which are felt here in Kentucky), ice storms, floods and tornadoes — are only growing in frequency and intensity. According to Climate Central, 83% of power failures can be attributed to weather changes. We must upgrade or suffer the dire consequences of inaction.

The aging grid in Eastern Kentucky requires a proactive approach to meet the needs of a region seeking a renaissance. Merely trimming trees and clearing brush do not guarantee a resilient power supply. Ratepayers deserve a reliable power supply that only comes from utilizing current technology.
Unfortunately, there has been a major issue at the Mitchell plant requiring significant capital and attention to address. One of Mitchell’s two concrete cooling towers is failing structurally at the over-50-year-old coal-burning plant and needs to be reinforced or replaced. 
According to Kentucky PSC records, the options to address the failing tower would be $376 million for a new mechanical draft or $356 million  to shorten the tower. Either way means money out of the ratepayers’ pocket for an expense that is not a long-term solution as the Mitchell plant, which Kentucky Power owns half of, is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2040. The money needed to shore up the tower will be in addition to the current proposed rate hike. Kentucky Power has said it is seeking a federal grant to help with this expense; time will tell.
The complicated history Kentucky Power has with its ratepayers continues to lean toward customer rate unsustainability. A correction must take place. 
We need companies providing good-paying jobs to locate in the service area to combat population loss, and those companies need fair electrical rates and adequate infrastructure. Ratepayers need Kentucky Power, a monopoly, to manage its operations more effectively. The truth is, families in Eastern Kentucky, who already pay the state’s highest average energy bills, can no longer bear the burden of questionable decisions by Kentucky Power, compounded by a hard-hit regional economy. 
PSC meetings on this matter were recently well attended in both Pikeville and Hazard as citizens and elected leaders alike spoke out in unity about the harm further rate hikes will cause.   
One more community meeting is on the schedule. The Kentucky PSC will be in Ashland at 5 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 8, at the Ashland Transportation Center to hear from ratepayers.
In addition, the Kentucky PSC accepts written comments by mail or email.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)As 850,000 Virginians (and millions nationwide) went without food stamps this fall during the federal government shutdown, the giant reconciliation bill Congress passed this summer set off a timer for states to reduce their error rates in computing the disbursement of funds to recipients. States that don’t comply risk losing their funding.
That means Virginia must drop its error rate from where it hovers now around 11% down to 6% by 2027. Otherwise, the state could be on the hook for $270 million annually. 
Enter “SNAP Forward,” an initiative spearheaded by Gov. Glenn Youngkin through an executive directive this past August with the express purpose of reducing the state’s SNAP error rates. It’s work that incoming Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s administration will inherit. 
Youngkin has publicly referenced the initiative and his administration’s efforts to slash SNAP error rates repeatedly in recent months, most recently in his final budget presentation to lawmakers last month, but has shared few details. The Mercury gleaned a clearer picture of the progress so far through a series of Freedom of Information Act requests and by reviewing  Youngkin’s  proposed state budget. 
 Compliance with federal law changes

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, helps low-income earners afford to buy groceries. States have always handled disbursing the federal funds to qualifying residents. Sometimes, errors in either overpaying or underpaying households arise, stemming from paperwork mistakes by government staff or outdated information from beneficiaries. 
When Congress passed its reconciliation bill in July, the measure stipulated that states with higher error rates may have to, for the first time, pay a portion of SNAP benefits to recipients. 
Beyond spurring error rate reductions, the law adjusted age and work eligibility requirements.
Since Oct. 1, Virginia beneficiaries can no longer attest to their expenses and income themselves. Now, state employees reviewing SNAP cases must  take further steps to verify applicants’ expenses. Household composition will be required to be verified as well by March 2026.
 Strategic meetings

A series of meeting presentation slides revealed by the November and December records request shows conversation materials used during a monthly series of “SNAP Forward” virtual meetings with local Department of Social Services workers around the state. The meetings began in September. 
The conversations entailed training refreshers for workers on managing SNAP, new policies to verify household information and notes on other states, like Wisconsin, which has maintained a low error rate. Virginia’s Department of Social Services has plans to conduct interviews with states that have track records of dropping their error rates to gather insights.

 Contracted help

The Mercury reviewed a $1.7 million contract for services by a company called KPMG included in the state’s FOIA response. The organization offers tax, audit and advisory services to companies and governments that hire it. 
With a six-month contract for services, KPMG has been tasked with deploying to “agreed-upon” local DSS offices to “support (Virginia) with targeted strategies to help improve SNAP payment accuracy.” The company was also hired to provide recommendations and prepare training documents.
The Mercury reached out to KPMG to inquire further but did not receive a response by the time of this publication. 
 A quality assurance team 

As local social service departments around the state handle SNAP case loads, the administrative ease or strain looks different in different localities. One of the records the state released to the Mercury was a document outlining feedback from the Virginia League of Social Services Executives. The group expressed concerns about whether smaller local social services offices in the state could handle the additional administrative burden that the new process would require. 
Lawmakers and advocates have also warned that these workers are expected to have heavier loads for Medicaid eligibility changes triggered by the reconciliation bill. 
Youngkin’s outgoing state budget proposal earmarks about $2.4 million to fund a quality assurance team for the Office of Health and Human Services — a potential solution for the expected administrative challenges. The 14 new positions Virginia could  hire would be responsible for helping to find and correct SNAP payment errors. 
Whether the team comes to be or not depends on upcoming budget negotiations in the 2026 legislative session, where Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger will have her own ideas about how the state should allocate its resources. After Virginia’s legislature agrees on the next state budget, Spanberger will be responsible for signing it or making adjustments.

Last year, one notable document was missing.
The annual report from the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission would normally have been published at the end of November. The JIRC’s 2024 report was a rich text: for the first time, it contained the names and misdeeds of Virginia judges who were disciplined by the seven-member commission for violating the commonwealth’s judicial cannons. The change was the result of a 2023 law sponsored by Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick, which passed with bipartisan support and backing from outgoing Attorney General Jason Miyares.
Virginia House approves bill to boost transparency when judges get punished

That brief window of transparency shut last year, when lawmakers unanimously passed a bill specifying they would be the first ones to see JIRC’s annual report — and decide if it’s ever made public. 
The change means the public won’t know the names and misconduct of errant judges in their community in 2025 unless lawmakers decide to release it. In 2024, that list included a Richmond judge who’d made unwanted advances on female attorneys and a Roanoke judge who’d had a relationship and provided legal aid to the mother of a man on trial for murder in the same courthouse. 
In a committee meeting last year, the 2025 bill’s sponsor, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, said judges deserved more privacy.
“The whole idea was — especially in unfounded cases — a lot of information that’s available under the FOIA law right now is information that might not be accurate and may be defamatory toward a judicial officer,” Deeds said in a February committee meeting, referring to the Freedom of Information Act.
But Deeds’ statement doesn’t align with what’s in the reports. Under the rules of the 2023 law, the outcomes of “unfounded cases” are not published in the JIRC’s annual report — only a much smaller number of cases where judges were disciplined for violating the cannons.

In an interview last week, Deeds said he was unaware the report only contained the names of disciplined judges.
“When there’s a founded complaint, when there’s disciplinary action — that ought to be public information,” Deeds said.
Deeds said the bill was “not my idea” and that he “really had not had any interest in this before.” At the committee meeting, he said former Portsmouth Circuit Court Judge Kenneth Melvin, who retired last month, had convinced him to carry the bill. The judge served as vice chair of JIRC and previously represented Portsmouth as a Democrat in the House of Delegates for 24 years. Melvin could not be reached for comment for this story.
Deeds said he was unsure how the General Assembly would publish the report, if it decided to do so, and said he was open to reconsidering the bill after a social media thread by Richmond reporter Sarah Vogelsong last month brought the issue to public attention. (Vogelsong previously served as  editor-in-chief of the Mercury).
“I didn’t realize people were hotly anticipating the release of these things,” Deeds said.
All 50 states have systems for screening and investigating ethical complaints against judges. Those complaints are always private, and the overwhelming majority in Virginia involve litigants unhappy with verdicts, JIRC’s counsel, Raymond Morrogh, told lawmakers in a 2021 Senate committee presentation. Those complaints aren’t eligible for JIRC’s review. If a panel determines a complaint does have merit, they can elect to gather more information, like a response from a judge, or simply express their disapproval without taking formal action.
If an investigation substantiates a complaint, judges may face a range of outcomes, including agreeing to disciplinary actions, like supervision or substance abuse treatment. In more serious cases, the JIRC may elect to hold a formal hearing. 
The hearings can resemble trials, where a state official presents evidence of misconduct, including witnesses and depositions, and a judge, often represented by a lawyer, presents their defense and cross-examines witnesses. The commission has the power to suspend a judge and recommend that the Virginia Supreme Court censure, remove, or force a judge into retirement.
In the majority of states — but not Virginia — fact-finding hearings involving judges are public, according to the National Center for State Courts. 
Indiana University law processor Charles Geyh, a national expert in judicial ethics, said in an interview that judges were often “reluctant to air their dirty laundry in public,” wary of undermining public trust in the courts. But Geyh argued Virginia’s level of secrecy into judicial misconduct risked undermining that goal.
“We’re past the point where the public is going to sit tight and have the judiciary say, ‘Trust me, we’re doing it — we’re just not telling anybody about it,’” Geyh said. “We’re past the point where that’s enough.”
Fairfax attorney Andi Geloo, a vocal critic of what she calls “wayward judges,” said the secrecy around judicial discipline created a separate standard from others accused of misconduct, from police officers to criminal defendants.
“The public has a right to know how judges are performing and whether they’re upholding the law,” Geloo said. “And this change sends a message that judges are above the law.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)When state Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, talks about Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act, she often does so from experience — both as a former journalist and as a lawmaker who says she has repeatedly seen the law used to discourage public access rather than promote it. 
Since her first year in office in 2018, Roem has made FOIA reform a legislative priority, reintroducing the same core proposal multiple times. Earlier this year, that effort nearly paid off, with her bill advancing further than ever before before ultimately dying late in the House.
Now, Roem is trying again.
She has reintroduced Senate Bill 56 for the 2026 General Assembly session, which is set to begin next week, reviving an effort to tighten limits on how much state and local governments can charge for public records and to clarify how agencies seek court relief when responding to large or complex requests. 
The proposal, which earned bipartisan support during the 2025 session, at the time passed the Senate, cleared a House committee and reached the House floor before being sent back to committee on a procedural vote after committees had stopped meeting, effectively killing the bill.
“It’s the same bill, different year,” Roem said in an interview with the Virginia Mercury. 
“I have worked since 2018 on this legislation, and I have introduced it five or so times over the years. The entire point of it is to reduce FOIA fees, so that the fees that are being charged are actually being used simply to cover the actual costs associated with pursuing FOIA requests in the first place, instead of being used as a deterrent for the public to not pursue FOIA requests.”
 Limiting FOIA fees

Under SB 56, public bodies would be prohibited from charging more than the median hourly rate of pay of their employees — or the actual hourly rate of the employee performing the work, whichever is lower — when calculating labor costs for producing public records. 
Supporters say the change would prevent agencies from assigning high-paid staff to routine FOIA requests in ways that inflate costs and discourage access.
Currently, Virginia law gives agencies broad discretion to determine who processes a request, a practice critics argue has allowed FOIA fees to climb into the hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
The bill creates a narrow exception to the fee cap. If a public body can demonstrate that no employee is available to process the request at or below the median hourly rate, it may petition a court for permission to exceed the limit. 
Roem said that provision is intended to accommodate situations involving specialized or technical records while still placing the burden on the agency to justify higher charges.
“Even I, as a state legislator, got hit with a FOIA fee earlier this year, a three-digit FOIA fee,” Roem said. “This happens to my constituents routinely.”
She pointed to a case in her district involving a mother who was charged more than $8,000 to view a 92-second video of her autistic daughter being dragged off a school bus. While the fee was later reduced, the woman still paid hundreds of dollars and needed $1,500 in financial assistance to cover the remaining cost.
“This happens again, and again, and again, and again, where FOIA fees are used as a deterrent to the public getting public information that they have already paid for,” Roem said. “Public documents are public, your tax dollars have already paid for these documents in the first place. Therefore, you should have the lowest barrier possible to accessing them.”
 Changes beyond cost

In addition to fee limits, SB 56 would update the required “notice of rights and responsibilities” 
that public bodies must post on their websites. The notice would be revised to explain how fees are calculated under the new limits and to describe the option for agencies to seek court approval to exceed the cap.
The bill also clarifies how agencies may seek additional time to respond to FOIA requests. Current law allows public bodies to petition a court for more time in limited circumstances, but the process has been criticized as unclear and inconsistent across jurisdictions.
Under Roem’s proposal, agencies could file such petitions in either general district court or circuit court, and courts would be directed to give those petitions priority on their dockets. Importantly for requesters, the bill would toll — or pause — the statutory response deadline while a petition is pending.
The legislation also makes technical changes to reorganize the FOIA statute, moving provisions related to charges for producing records into a separate section for clarity.
Taken together, the bill aims to standardize FOIA fees statewide, reduce the use of cost as a barrier to public access and provide clearer procedures for courts, agencies and requesters when disputes arise.
 FOIA as a public tool

Roem has repeatedly emphasized that FOIA reform is not about making life easier for journalists.

“The public needs to care about this, because it is the most important tool that they have to hold their government accountable in between elections,” she said. “It is the single most important tool that they have. That’s a misconception that it’s just reporters and some state actors who use it.”
She noted that support for the bill has come from across the political spectrum, including social conservative groups that often oppose her on other issues.
“FOIA is not just for the people we agree with,” Roem said. “It’s for people who disagree with us, and it is for people who are perfectly neutral and just collecting data. FOIA is for everyone.”
Despite broad rhetorical support for transparency, Roem said FOIA reform rarely becomes a voting issue for the public, making it easier for lawmakers to treat compliance as a burden rather than a core responsibility.
“The Virginia Freedom of Information Act is consistently treated as a burden by government officials rather than a necessary obligation of government to its citizens,” she said. “It needs to be seen as a vital, important government service, as opposed to an administrative burden.”
Alan Gernhardt, executive director of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act Advisory Council, said the council’s staff has studied earlier versions of Roem’s proposal.
“As staff, we do not take any position on pending legislation,” Gernhardt said. He explained that a council subcommittee studied Roem’s SB 324 in 2024 and produced an executive summary and report, but did not reach consensus on a recommendation. A subsequent council meeting lacked a quorum, preventing a formal vote.
Gernhardt said Roem’s 2025 bill was based on that earlier work but was not referred back to the council after it failed to pass.
 How Virginia compares

Virginia’s FOIA system has long drawn criticism for its complexity and inconsistency. With the commonwealth’s 133 localities, Roem said, there are effectively 133 different approaches to public records access. Her bill draws in part from practices used in York County, which she described as a more reasonable, nonpartisan model.
Virginia’s approach also stands in contrast to FOIA systems in several other states that place tighter limits on fees or waive them entirely in many circumstances. 
According to a 2023 national review by the transparency nonprofit MuckRock, some states restrict charges to the actual cost of duplication, while others prohibit agencies from charging for staff time altogether unless a request is deemed unusually burdensome.
States such as Colorado and Indiana, for example, cap or standardize labor fees, reducing agencies’ discretion to assign higher-paid employees to routine requests. 
Other states have moved even further toward low- or no-cost public records access. In Nevada, agencies generally may charge only for the cost of copies, unless a request is classified as “extraordinary,” and even then the law requires fee policies to be clearly posted. 
At the federal level, the U.S. Freedom of Information Act allows for fee waivers when disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations — a standard transparency advocates say states should more broadly adopt. 
An overview of federal FOIA fee waivers is available online, while comparisons of state public-records laws are compiled by the National Freedom of Information Coalition.
“Some states don’t have FOIA fees at all,” Roem said. “Some states have much more reasonable systems than we do. It can be free, and others have reduced rates. Virginia’s system sucks.”
 Prospects in 2026

Roem is hopeful that SB 56 will pass during the 2026 session, citing the bill’s near-miss earlier this year and a House with dozens of new members. She said she is reintroducing the legislation “literally verbatim” from the version that earned bipartisan support, but plans to make the case again to lawmakers unfamiliar with its history.
Still, uncertainty remains over whether the measure would become law even if it clears the General Assembly.
It is unclear whether incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer, would sign the bill. A spokesman for Spanberger did not respond to a request for comment.
For Roem, the stakes extend beyond this year’s vote.
“I have repeatedly compared the Freedom of Information Act in Virginia to a giant slice of Swiss cheese,” she said, “which every single year gets more and more holes poked in it, and less and less cheese around it.”
She added: “Here we are voting to add more exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act without having fewer exemptions to offset it. This is about strengthening the most important accountability tool the public has.”

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)When the State Corporation Commission approved Dominion Energy Virginia’s proposal to build a new, 944 MW gas peaker plant on November, 25 it looked like the end of a long, drawn-out battle over the future of fossil fuels in Virginia.
SCC approves Chesterfield gas plant and Dominion rate hike, creates new rate class for data centers

The approval seemed to signal that for now, at least, the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) would not stand in the way of new gas-burning turbines in spite of their high greenhouse gas emissions. According to the SCC’s order, the surge in power demand from data centers had triggered a reliability exception to the VCEA’s ban on new fossil fuel construction.  
Then suddenly, on December 16, the SCC granted the Southern Environmental Law Center’s (SELC) motion to reconsider the decision the commission had rendered just weeks before,  suspending approval of Dominion’s plan. What the heck?
The SCC did not limit what it intends to reconsider, suggesting it will look anew at each of the four issues SELC raised. Since those issues cover pretty much everything about the gas plant’s approval, it’s impossible to guess what is going on. 
Certainly, there are many reasons to criticize the initial approval of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center (CERC), beyond its climate impacts. The majority-Black community where the plant would be located suffered for decades from exposure to toxic air pollution spewing from the huge coal plant on the site. Closure of the coal plant had brought a welcome respite. Residents fear they will once again serve as a sacrifice zone for decades to come, in spite of environmental justice protections written into the VCEA.
In addition, Dominion had gamed the planning process so thoroughly that this alone might have caused the SCC to reject the proposal. Dominion had gone ahead and put in an order for the gas turbine even before soliciting proposals from third parties to address reliability concerns, as the law requires. On top of that, the company told the SCC that an independent third party had reviewed the options, which was false. 
 Dominion, it turned out, never had any intention of awarding the project to anyone but itself or of considering alternatives that didn’t involve fossil gas. How could the SCC reward such malfeasance?
The VCEA prioritizes the security and reliability of the power supply even over its carbon-cutting and cost-saving goals, but there are conditions attached to approving new power plants, intended to make new fossil fuel generation something of a last resort. SELC and other environmental groups had made a strong case both that Dominion failed to meet those conditions, and that there were non-fossil fuel alternatives that could provide reliability at less cost.
But if Dominion’s gaming of the process should have sparked outrage at the SCC, it also succeeded in putting the regulators in a difficult position. The mere suggestion of a future with rolling blackouts if a power company doesn’t get its way would cow any public utility commission, let alone one in a state facing an unprecedented surge in demand.  
That explains the SCC’s order approving a certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) for the gas plant Dominion swears is its only viable option. What, then, explains the about face on December 16, less than 24 hours after receiving the motion to reconsider?  
 Four possible errors

In its motion, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), representing Appalachian Voices, the NAACP and Mothers Out Front, argued that the SCC erred on four points around environmental justice, the cost of the gas plant compared to alternatives, the burden of proof on reliability and the legal mechanism for cost recovery. 
If the SCC were to agree with any of the first three arguments, the result would require new analysis, and might even send Dominion back to the drawing board. Agreement on the fourth point, however, would only change how Dominion charges ratepayers for the cost of the project. It would require the company to put the cost into base rates instead of a new rider, making CERC potentially less profitable for the company.  
This last point looks like something of a legal slam-dunk. A provision in the VCEA allows rate recovery through a rider only when a utility has met its energy efficiency targets – something all parties agree Dominion has not done. 
SELC also alleged that the commission failed to ensure the development of CERC “does not have a disproportionate adverse impact on historically economically disadvantaged communities,” another statutory requirement. The SCC’s original order addressed the point but appears to have misread this section of the law. That fact alone would justify a reconsideration of the November 25 order, though it would not alter the core of the decision to approve a CPCN for the gas plant.   
SELC’s other three points put CERC in greater jeopardy, if the SCC agrees. 
The commission’s environmental justice analysis consisted mainly of a judgment that a gas plant would be less harmful to the surrounding Black and Hispanic community than the coal plant that was formerly on the site. This may or may not be true, but that’s not the standard. On the contrary, a minority community that has suffered decades of pollution shouldn’t be first in line for the next polluting project to come along. That “disproportionate” impact is precisely what the VCEA and the Environmental Justice Act prohibit.
If the SCC were to side with the local community on this point, it wouldn’t stop Dominion from building a gas plant, but it would require the company to find a new location.  
The two final arguments attack the decision that a large gas peaker plant is the right remedy for a looming energy crisis. SELC contends that Dominion didn’t prove the cost of the gas plant is reasonable, citing the company’s deeply flawed process for considering alternatives and its failure to include fuel cost data. SELC also complains the SCC didn’t require Dominion to prove that its claimed threat to reliability could only be satisfied with a fossil fuel plant, but had merely taken the company’s word for it. 
These are accurate complaints about Dominion’s flawed process and strained analysis, and compelling reasons to reject Dominion’s plan — but they were just as compelling on November 25, when the SCC issued its order granting the CPCN.  
Indeed, the SCC had to both close its eyes and grasp at straws to reach the conclusions it did. For example, a footnote in the SCC’s order cites a Dominion witness’ testimony for the proposition that a Sierra Club witness had agreed a gas plant would be needed eventually. The commissioners did not take the time to find and review the Sierra Club’s testimony, which would have shown the Dominion witness had mischaracterized the evidence. Indeed, the Sierra Club’s modeling showed an alternative portfolio of clean resources would provide more energy than CERC at less cost. 
But apparently, gaming the process, ignoring the law and mischaracterizing the evidence are all things Dominion is willing to do to get an expensive fossil fuel plant approved in the face of the rigorous conditions set by the VCEA. 
On December 29, the SCC set a date of January 23 for Dominion to reply to the issues raised by SELC in its motion for reconsideration; presumably the commission will then set a date for a new hearing on those issues. The timeline could push a final decision on CERC out beyond the end of this year’s legislative session, making the interplay of politics and policy all the more interesting.

Kelly Ayotte signs legislation related to immigration enforcement in May. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Beginning Jan. 1, people in New Hampshire may face new penalties if they post “No Trespassing” signs on land not their own. Owners of nuisance dogs that repeatedly bite will face higher fines. And the Division of Motor Vehicles must create a “blue envelope” program to allow drivers with autism spectrum disorder to obtain envelopes with information on how to best communicate with them if an officer pulls them over.  
The Legislature passed more than 300 bills in 2025, and Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed all but a few. While most of that legislation took effect shortly after Ayotte’s signature this summer, a number took effect on New Year’s Day.
Here are the newly effective state laws in 2026. 
A ban on gender-affirming care for minors
In 2024, the Legislature banned “genital gender reassignment surgery” for those under 18. In 2025, the body banned virtually all other forms of gender-affirming care. 
House Bill 377, which took effect Jan. 1, bars medical professionals from carrying out any procedure on a minor “attempting to alter the appearance of or affirm the minor’s perception of his or her gender or sex,” including with surgeries, hormone therapy, and puberty blockers. Minors who began their procedures prior to Jan. 1 may continue them, but the practice must end moving forward, and providers who ignore the law must face “administrative disciplinary action,” though not criminal charges. 
Transgender rights advocates have decried the law as harmful to transgender youth who have used the treatment to align themselves to their gender identity; supporters argued the procedures can have permanent effects and should be studied more.  
An end to sanctuary cities
Starting in 2026, local law enforcement agencies will be required to follow immigration detainers issued by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Those detainers require local police to hold a person that has been arrested for up to 48 hours in order for ICE agents to arrive and potentially take custody if the person has violated immigration laws. 
The bill, House Bill 511, also prohibits cities and towns from passing “sanctuary city” policies in which police departments are instructed to not inform ICE about potential immigration violations of people in custody and to disregard the retainers.
A slew of fee increases
A number of fee increases have gone into effect this month, part of a push by lawmakers last year to find revenue without raising taxes. Among the increases are the fee for a new driver’s license, from $10 to $20; a rise in vanity plates from $40 to $60, and a jump in the price for a new motor vehicle registration from $25 to $35.
There are also fee hikes for specific industries. Pesticide dealers will now pay a $160 fee for each new pesticide they register; tractor registration fees are now $11, up from $6; and cement mixers are increased to $12, up from $1.80.
A prohibition on ambulance ‘balance billing’ 
Starting in 2026, people who ride an ambulance will no longer be personally charged if the ambulance ride costs more than their health insurer is willing to pay. Senate Bill 245 bans the practice of “balance billing,” also known as surprise billing. The bill also sets mandatory rates for how much ambulance companies can charge insurers.
“This bill is going to make sure that when you have that ambulance come to your house for your mother or your father or your loved one, that there’s not a surprise bill that comes afterwards, that really makes you feel, ‘Wow. How can I pay for this?’” Ayotte said at a bill signing in August. 
A crackdown on AI use and chatbots against minors
This year, it will be a violation of child endangerment laws for the owner of a chatbot or other online service to use artificial intelligence to “to facilitate, encourage, offer, solicit” sexually explicit conduct, use of illegal drugs or alcohol, acts of self-harm, or acts of violence from a child.  
The new law, passed via House Bill 143, is in part directed toward chatbots that use AI technology to allow children to role-play conversations with different personas, whether through a video game, movie, TV show, or other interaction. The owner or operator must know that they are intending to facilitate or engage that behavior; those who do may face a civil lawsuit brought by the state Attorney General’s Office and may pay a fine of at least $1,000 per violation.
The laws also target the use of artificial intelligence to create “intimate visual representation” of children, equivalent to child sexual abuse imagery. Starting Jan. 1, doing so will be a Class B felony and a registrable offense, under Senate Bill 300. 
Landlords cannot require electronic payment for rent
Beginning in the new year, tenants have the right to refuse to pay rent via electronic means. Previously, landlords could require payment through apps such as Venmo or Zelle; now, under House Bill 309, the landlord “shall allow at least one other non-electronic form of payment” to pay for a lease, a lease renewal, or an extension. 
Mandatory accessible voting machines at town meetings
As of January, a pilot program to expand accessible voting is now permanent. In 2024, lawmakers required cities and towns to provide accessible voting machines at local elections, like town meetings and municipal elections. Now, under House Bill 67, the state will continue that mandate in a long-term arrangement. The machines, which are already used in federal elections, allow people with disabilities to easily vote using a keyboard or touchscreen and print out a ballot with their choices selected. 
Last year, municipalities tested out a system in which they borrowed the machines from the Secretary of State’s Office; moving forward, cities and towns will continue borrowing the machines but will pay for the cost of programming the machines for local elections. 
Voter information sharing between poll workers and state
Election workers in cities and towns will also be empowered to request personal information from state records to confirm people’s eligibility to vote in that polling district. Under House Bill 464, the Department of Safety and Secretary of State’s Office may share records that could show proof of a would-be-voter’s citizenship, such as birth certificates, as well as age and domicile. 
The new powers come as the state prepares for the federal midterm elections in November, and more than a year after the passage of House Bill 1569 in 2024, which required new registrants in the state to provide hard copies of proof of citizenship in order to vote. 
Meanwhile, Senate Bill 221, which also took effect Jan. 1, requires town supervisors of the checklist to verify voter rolls every year, rather than every 10 years under the previous law. 
A new parental right to their minor child’s library records
Parents will also have new record-seeking powers. As of the new year, House Bill 273 allows parents to request from public libraries their minor children’s borrowing records. That includes printed materials, DVDs, CDs, and other audio-visual materials; the information must be requested by a parent or legal guardian.  
Dumping yard waste in public bodies of water now illegal
Starting Jan. 1, it will be illegal to dump yard waste into any state body of water, on the ice of such water, or on the banks of the water. Anyone who “purposely or knowingly” violates this law will face a felony violation. The bill, House Bill 416, added yard waste to a list of existing materials not allowed to be dumped into waters, including bottles, glass, crockery, cans, scrap metal, junk, paper, garbage, tires, old automobiles or car parts, and trees. 
Meanwhile, House Bill 179, which took effect Thursday, imposes stiffer financial penalties on people who discharge hazardous or toxic wastes and have failed to pay the expenses associated with the cleanup. After 90 days of nonpayment of those expenses, the new law imposes a $1,000 additional fine per day until the expenses are paid. 
A new ‘C-PACER’ system for energy-efficient development
Developers and property owners will have access this year to a revamped financial mechanism to pay for energy efficient apartment buildings. Known as C-PACER, the new system will replace an older system that observers said was poorly designed and burdensome for towns. Now, the program will be run by the New Hampshire Business Finance Authority. 
Supporters say the voluntary program could make it easier for developers to find savings through energy efficiency and then use those savings to make the housing projects more attainable.  
Department of Education subpoena powers for teachers
As lawyers continue to spar over a state law barring certain concepts around race and gender from being taught in public schools, the Department of Education now has the ability to issue subpoenas to teachers. House Bill 520, which took effect Thursday, allows hearing officers at the department to issue subpoenas to teachers and school staff. 
Those subpoenas can be carried out for investigations into code of conduct violations by teachers, and can include books, papers, documents, and other items. 
The U.S. District Court of New Hampshire struck down the state’s “banned concepts” law in 2024; lawyers for the state have appealed that ruling to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. But supporters of HB 520 say it will help the department investigate other forms of misconduct, such as harassment and sexual assault. 
A quicker return of confiscated firearms
New Hampshire residents who relinquish their firearms to police due to a court order could now have an easier time getting those weapons back when the order expires. 
House Bill 506 requires that courts ensure a “prompt” return of the firearm to the individual once the protective order expires. The bill states that courts may choose to carry out background checks to see if the person is barred from under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System or under records held by state police. But those background checks are not required. And under the new law, individuals have a right to request a hearing to challenge a court’s decision to withhold the firearm, in which the Department of Safety must show up in court and provide “clear and convincing” evidence that the person is barred from having the firearm. 
Should the department not show to the hearing, the court must return the firearm to the individual by default, the bill states.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AyotteSigningMay222025-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-05 05:11:57.607709

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A health care administrator who narrowly lost a bid for the Arkansas House last year is running once again, this time against an Air Force veteran in Tuesday’s special election.
The two are vying for the Democratic nomination in the hopes of flipping a Republican-held district that includes portions of North Little Rock and Sherwood as well as the Camp Joseph T. Robinson military base. Rep. Carlton Wing, R-North Little Rock, was serving his fifth term when he resigned in September to head Arkansas TV, the state’s recently rebranded public television outlet.

Wing’s resignation triggered a special election, and the special primary for House District 70 pits Alex Holladay against Cordelia Smith-Johnson.
The election has Holladay knocking on the same doors he visited a little over a year ago before Wing defeated him by 316 votes.
“It’s like a battle scar, like, ‘Yeah, I did this before, and it worked, they remember me,’” Holladay said.
Cordelia Smith-Johnson (Courtesy of the Arkansas Secretary of State)
Smith-Johnson has not run for office before but said residents comment on her accessibility and willingness to take on challenges.
“[They say], ‘You’re not scared to say this, you’re not scared to challenge a person on this,’” Smith-Johnson said. “I’ve been in the Air Force. I’ve never been scared of a fight.”
The primary winner will face Republican Bo Renshaw in the special general election on March 3. Regardless of who wins Tuesday, Smith-Johnson and Holladay will have a rematch in the regular primary, also on March 3.
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders initially scheduled the special election to align with the regularly scheduled one in November. The state Democratic Party sued. Sanders relented after a judge ruled in the party’s favor.

 Health care

Smith-Johnson left the Air Force in 2019 and is now a prevention coordinator for the Army National Guard. Holladay recruits health care professionals for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
Both candidates said health care affordability is a major policy concern.
Smith-Johnson said many fellow veterans have expressed frustration about “the long wait time to see a specialist” because Arkansas doesn’t have enough highly specialized physicians. Her campaign website states veterans should have adequate housing and job opportunities as well as needed physical and mental health care.
“No one who served this country should have to fight for basic services,” the website states.
Holladay said he’s concerned about the impact of Medicaid cuts on District 70’s elderly population, in addition to the fact that “it’s just way too confusing getting care.”
“My dad is currently on long-term hospice,” he said. “Navigating that process is a nightmare, and I’m a professional.”
The federal government’s upcoming changes to Medicaid include work requirements and higher out-of-pocket costs for enrollees. KFF projects that Medicaid expansion states like Arkansas, could see a 14% drop in enrollment.










It’s like a battle scar, like, ‘Yeah, I did this before, and it worked, they remember me.'

 Education

Both candidates said they got into politics via the education system. Holladay considered running for school board in North Little Rock in 2023. The seat in his zone wasn’t up for election until 2026, so he ran for the Legislature in 2024 instead, he said. 
What inspired Holladay to run was frustration with the LEARNS Act, the 2023 law that created a school voucher program that allows state funding to be used for certain private school and homeschooling expenses.
The state needs to implement “stricter guidelines” over how school voucher money is spent, he said. The state also should ensure an “equilateral education” for Arkansas children regardless of where they live or what type of school they attend, he said.
Smith-Johnson said school vouchers take away funds public schools could use for services to students with disabilities. Her daughter is homeschooled, but when she was in a traditional school setting, she was falling behind because she “didn’t have the resources” she needed from her individualized education plan, Smith-Johnson said.
“I stepped in to be the voice, and I got the parents to come stick with me on behalf of their kids, and we got things done, and I realized then that there’s power in a voice,” Smith-Johnson said.










I’ve been in the Air Force. I’ve never been scared of a fight.

 Affordability and the prison proposal

Both candidates favor expanding access to pre-K. Smith-Johnson’s campaign website says she supports state-funded child care, and Holladay’s website expresses support for the child tax credit.
Smith-Johnson said a key tenet of affordability is ensuring low-income people’s access to food assistance such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. She said she opposes new federal work requirements for SNAP recipients because they’re “not feasible,” including for veterans.
“I grew up on SNAP benefits,” she said. “My mom worked, and we still survived on SNAP.” [2026 Primary Election Voter Guide: The candidates, the ballot measures, and the tools you need to cast your vote.]
Holladay said some voters have told him they’re upset that Sanders wants to build a multimillion-dollar, 3,000-bed prison while people are “struggling to go to the grocery store.”
“I’ve been surprised by the number of voters that bring it up,” Holladay said. “I don’t even ask. They just bring it up because one of our [campaign] taglines is, ‘What matters to you?’”
Voters in Senate District 26 will also head to the polls Tuesday to choose a Republican candidate for their own special election. District 26 includes part of Franklin County, where the state bought 815 acres of land for the planned prison. The project met backlash from local residents, including the late Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield, whose death in September triggered the election.
Smith-Johnson said she too has heard District 70 voters bring up the prison unprompted. She used to work as a probation officer, and she said a more effective response to crime in Arkansas would be restructuring the probation system.
“I don’t think a prison will solve our problems when we don’t have any rehabilitation in place,” she said.
Early voting for the special elections started Dec. 30 and ends Monday. District 70 residents can find their polling places on the Secretary of State’s website.

We agree.
Building a new medical school at URI isn’t adequate. 
But we disagree about the value of such a medical school, which we think is a critical element of a long-term solution to our primary care woes.
A new medical school won’t cure R.I.’s primary care shortage. Here’s a better idea.

Primary care is critical to Rhode Island’s health services delivery system because the supply of primary care physicians has been shown, over and over again, to be associated with better public health outcomes and lower costs.
We think everybody in Rhode Island should have a regular source of primary care.
Rhode Island needs 133 to 266 more clinicians than we have now, according to a 2024 presentation to the Rhode Island Senate Study Commission on the new Medical School by the advocacy group Primary Care for All Americans.
That means committing the state to developing this workforce, but an arms race to steal them from neighboring states is not a viable long-term strategy.  A new medical school, if it admits Rhode Islanders preferentially and obligates them to practice in Rhode Island for a number of years, is critical to this “grow your own” strategy.










Building a new medical school at URI isn’t adequate. But we disagree about the value of such a medical school, which we think is a critical element of a long-term solution to our primary care woes.


Rhode Island’s primary care workforce strategy should also include developing primary care nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants. Nurse practitioners now constitute about 50% of the primary care workforce. But though a number of good studies show that nurse practitioners can provide the same quality of care for specific procedures as physicians, high quality primary care is a team sport with physicians using their training to help lead the team and handle complex cases.
That new medical school can also help seed the development of new primary care residencies, which, as Hackey and Johnson correctly indicate, are critical to addressing our workforce needs.  (We should also be developing nurse practitioner residencies to make sure all our primary care clinicians are well trained.)  
A new medical school is also an economic engine for the state, as testimony to the special legislative commission’s report explains. And that new medical school gives Rhode Islanders their best shot at attending medical school near home — most of the Rhode Island high school students who go to medical school now have to leave the state to do so. There is good evidence that students who go to both medical school and residency in their home state are much more likely to stay and practice here — and we need lots more Rhode Islanders to go to medical school, do a primary care residency, and then stay to practice here, in their own communities. 
We need to act today on the more immediate fixes Hackey and Johnson note: improving primary care physician take-home pay; reducing the primary care administrative burden; improving electronic medical records so they are user friendly and helping clinicians manage their workload, instead of adding to it. 
In the medium term, creating robust loan repayment programs is essential, so clinicians in training today will take primary care jobs in Rhode Island. We need to continue to fund scholarships with obligations to practice primary care in Rhode Island, so we train more primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and PAs who commit themselves to practicing primary care here; and build many more new community-based residency programs for primary care physicians, nurse practitioners and PAs. Our strong community health center system is the logical base for this work. 
There is no quick and easy fix to this national problem that took 30 or more years to develop. Massachusetts now has a new statewide Task Force on Primary Care Access, Delivery, and Payment. Delaware is reportedly planning to use $100 million of its Rural Health Transformation Grant funds to build a new medical school and help address the challenges we also face. Rhode Island’s U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is leading discussions in Washington to implement essential reforms in Medicare to rebalance its payments from specialty care to primary care,  
The cost of a new medical school represents a tiny fraction of Rhode Island’s $4 billion yearly health care spend, much of which is unnecessary or wasted. A new medical school alone won’t fix primary care fix the mess — but it is an important step forward, one that will give hope to Rhode Islanders, a place to study near home for our students, and the pathway for everybody in our state to have a relationship with a skilled, compassionate clinician as they seek long, healthy and fulfilling lives in our state.

Getty Images/PonyWangA state legislative committee is recommending expanded loan forgiveness for doctors and increased funding for mobile screening units to combat a severe shortage of cancer care providers in rural Georgia.
The House Study Committee on Cancer Care Access released its final report following a series of public meetings across the state held last year. The committee, chaired by Rep. Lee Hawkins, a Gainesville Republican, was tasked with identifying barriers to care as cancer cases in the U.S. are expected to rise.
“The rural oncologist is really a dying breed. We don’t have very many oncologists who are setting up shop in rural areas, and part of that is related to the fact that oncology in general is having difficulties with workforce sustainability,” said Dr. Kristin Higgins, chief clinical officer at City of Hope Cancer Center Atlanta and a member of the study committee, in an interview.

Georgia faces a significant disparity in access to care between its metro hubs and rural communities. According to the committee’s findings, although one-fifth of Georgians live in rural counties, only as much as 8% of the state’s oncologists practice there.
To address a shortage of rural doctors specializing in cancer care, the committee recommended expanding the state’s Physician Loan Repayment Program to include specialists practicing in rural areas and increasing the amount of loan forgiveness available. Currently, Georgia offers $150,000 over four years to physicians practicing in rural counties. The report also suggests encouraging rural rotations for medical students.
The committee found that Georgia’s rural counties – or counties with less than 50,000 residents – often face higher poverty rates and hospital closures, making travel to urban treatment centers difficult for patients.
“When you are in smaller communities around the state — I always think about Dublin, Georgia, which is right in the smack dab center of our state —  you have to go to Macon or to Savannah or to Augusta or to Atlanta. There are so many that don’t have that access that I have been so fortunate to have,” said Lynn Durham, CEO of Georgia Center for Oncology Research and Education and a three-time cancer survivor who advocated for the study committee’s creation.
According to the Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan 2024-2029, which calls for increased attention to addressing disparities among cancer deaths, minority and rural populations are disproportionately affected by cancer mortality. Men are also more likely to die from cancer than women.
“I think Georgians deserve access to cancer care close to home. I hear all the time that people want to be with their support systems when they’re going through one of the toughest journeys of their life,” Durham said. “They want to be home and get the best possible treatment they can right here.”
To improve early detection, the legislative panel’s report recommends supporting the use of mobile cancer screening units in rural and underserved areas, such as the Brunswick-based Southeast Georgia Health System Wellness on Wheels.

“In 2025 alone, the WOW mobile mammography unit performed approximately 100 site visits with over 400 patient encounters,” said Chad Roberson, director of imaging services at Southeast Georgia Health System.
But running a mobile clinic presents its own challenges. Roberson said that the mobile unit operates “both a clinic and a heavy-duty truck, requiring additional repairs and regular maintenance to perform effectively.” He said that with such a specialized vehicle, issues can arise during periods of high use, increasing costs and causing downtime. He also said the mobile units require health care workers willing to travel long distances and work irregular hours.
The committee also proposed increasing the percentage of tobacco settlement funds appropriated for cancer prevention and screening. Georgia has received about $4 billion from the master settlement agreement with the tobacco industry over the last 27 years, with about $600 million dedicated to cancer-related activities.
Advocates argue that funding for access to cancer care is crucial as federal funding cuts to Medicaid from H.R.1 passed over the summer, which along with expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, is set to reduce health care funding by more than $50 billion by 2034, according to a November 2025 report from the Georgia Health Initiative,
Fabienne Antoine-Nasser, government relations director with American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, urged the state to increase funding for cancer-related programs, particularly the tobacco use prevention program, a state program that was discontinued in May due to federal cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Antoine-Nasser suggested raising taxes on tobacco, which could generate $350 million in annual revenue if increased by $1.50 per pack, would help address federal funding gaps.
“I believe that taking a really staunch look at (raising tobacco taxes) … would have such a great impact and really help Georgians who are pre-diagnosed and want to be able to get access to prevention measures, or post as well who want to get access to care,” Antoine-Nasser said.
The committee report also called for supporting the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University in its pursuit of National Cancer Institute designation. Currently, the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University is the state’s only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center, and establishing a second in another region of the state could provide patients with greater access to a wider range of treatments through clinical trials.
While the committee did not recommend full Medicaid expansion, a long-standing goal for some health advocates like Antoine-Nasser, it did recommend simplifying Medicaid access, enrollment and renewal for pediatric patients and addressing reimbursement rates for oncology-related codes. American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network sent Hawkins a letter in July outlining how federal budget cuts under the Trump administration could affect access to care, saying that policies could cut Medicaid funding for Georgia by an estimated $8 billion over the next decade, with $2.2 billion of those cuts specifically falling on rural areas.
“Protecting and strengthening Medicaid access and access to care is going to be so imperative,” Antoine-Nasser said, pointing to estimated losses of health care coverage due to expiring ACA enhanced tax credits. If these tax credits expire, which the House is set to vote on a three-year extension in January, the GHI report projects that 340,000 Georgians will become uninsured.
Hawkins said in an interview that because of funding uncertainty at the federal level, he is not sure if he can move forward with any recommendation, at least not until the impact of federal funding cuts becomes clearer.
“As of right now, until that shakes out, I do not have any proposed legislation,” Hawkins said. “Just about all the recommendations would need to be funded, and with the One Big, Beautiful Bill, our health care funding is up in the air right now.”
The chairman also seemed concerned about the impact from the expiring Affordable Care Act  subsidies, saying that without a federal fix, insurance costs could skyrocket for Georgians.
“The numbers that I read, it looks very depressing for individuals being able to afford their insurance. I mean, some of the policies are doubling in cost,” Hawkins said.
Lawmakers can consider the recommendations in the upcoming legislative session, which starts Jan. 12, and Higgins was optimistic they would find bipartisan support.
“(Access to cancer care) is not going to be controversial. It’s not going to be a controversial area of funding,” Higgins said. “Everybody is affected by cancer.”

Freestanding birth centers can address maternal health inequities, but many are facing mounting financial and regulatory pressures. (Photo courtesy of Sarah Simmons)Dr. Heather Skanes opened Alabama’s first freestanding birth center in 2022 in her hometown of Birmingham. Skanes, an OB-GYN, wanted to improve access to maternal health care in a state that’s long had one of the nation’s highest rates of maternal and infant mortality.
Those rates are especially high among Black women and infants. Skanes’ Oasis Family Birthing Center opened in a majority-Black neighborhood, offering midwifery services as well as medical care.
But about six months after the center’s first delivery — a girl who was Alabama’s first baby born in a freestanding birth center — the state health department ordered Skanes to shut it down. A department representative informed her that by holding deliveries at the birth center, she was operating an “unlicensed hospital,” she said.
Hospital labor and delivery units are shuttering across the nation — including more than two dozen in 2025 alone. Freestanding birth centers like Skanes’ could help fill the gaps, but they too are struggling to stay open.
They face some of the same financial pressures that bedevil hospitals’ labor and delivery units, including payments from insurers that don’t cover the full cost of providing maternity care.
Birth center owners also must contend with arcane state rules and antipathy from politically powerful hospitals that view them as competition, especially in rural areas with few births.
Nationwide, the number of freestanding birth centers doubled between 2012 and 2022, but more recently the pressures have taken a toll: About two dozen centers have closed since 2023, bringing the total number down to about 395, according to the most recent data from the American Association of Birth Centers.
Hospitals block much-needed birth centers in the South

In November, Pennsylvania Lifecycle Wellness and Birth Center announced it would shut down birth center services, citing pressure from regulatory challenges and sharp surges in malpractice premiums. It had served Philadelphia for 47 years. And New Mexico’s longest-operating freestanding birth center stopped delivering babies in December.
“When a new business opens, within the first three to five years you expect a certain number will close,” said Kate Bauer, executive director of the American Association of Birth Centers. “But we’ve had several long-standing birth centers close [in 2025] and that hits particularly hard.”
In California, which has some of the strictest birth center licensing rules in the country, concern over the closure of at least 19 birth centers between 2020 and 2024 prompted the state legislature to pass a law in October to streamline birth center licensure.
An appealing alternative
Freestanding birth centers are not attached to hospitals and aim to provide a more homelike, less traditional medical setting. They employ midwives and focus on low-risk pregnancies and births. Some also have an OB-GYN or family medicine doctor on staff, and they often have partnerships with nearby hospitals and doctors if more specialized care is required.
Some Black and Indigenous midwives and doulas say birth centers can be helpful alternatives to their community members, many of whom have had experiences in more medicalized settings that left them feeling marginalized, dismissed or unsafe.
Midwife Jamarah Amani, executive director of Southern Birth Justice Network, runs a mobile midwifery clinic serving majority-Black and Latino neighborhoods in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The nonprofit, which aims to make midwife and doula care more accessible, recently bought a building for a freestanding birth center it aims to open in 2027.
“[Midwifery] presents like a luxury concierge-type of service, and our goal is to really change that and to bring it back to the community in a very grassroots way,” Amani said. She added that expanding access to prenatal care could help address inequities in maternal health, as maternal death rates among Black women are three times higher than those among white women.
Freestanding birth centers also can be a solution for communities without a hospital nearby.
The closest hospital to the Colville Indian Reservation, located in northern Washington state, is half an hour away, said Faith Zacherle-Tonasket, founder of the nonprofit xa?xa? Indigenous Birth Justice.
So far, the group has trained nearly a dozen tribal doulas and midwives to serve the area. In the next few years, it plans to open a freestanding birth center. Zacherle-Tonasket said Indigenous-run birth centers are crucial alternatives for tribal women, who also have some of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation and often face prejudice in clinical settings.
“They don’t feel safe. So a lot of them just don’t get prenatal care,” said Zacherle-Tonasket. “Bringing traditional midwives that are from our own communities, that were born and raised in our communities, that know the families — we know that those babies will be birthed with love.”
Regulatory hurdles
When the Georgia legislature relaxed state health care regulations in 2024, it felt like a long-awaited win for Katie Chubb. A registered nurse and mother of three who’s worked in health and nonprofits, Chubb has spent years trying to open a birth center in Augusta.
The state denied her application to open the center in 2021. Georgia, like many states, requires health care providers to get state approval, called a certificate of need, before they can build a new facility or expand services. Rival providers, like other hospitals, can challenge an application, effectively vetoing their local competition.
That happened in Chubb’s case: Two local hospitals filed letters of opposition against her and refused to say they’d accept emergency transfers from her birth center, another requirement for opening.
Georgia currently has three freestanding birth centers, a fraction of the more than two dozen that operate in neighboring Florida.
“We’re seeing women giving birth in hospital hallways or at home unassisted, because there’s no in-between option like a birth center,” Chubb said. In October, Georgia lost another labor and delivery unit at a rural hospital two hours north of Augusta.
“Women are just left to figure things out.”

In Kentucky, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a bill in March that aimed to clear the way for freestanding birth centers by exempting them from the certificate of need process.
But Republican lawmakers attached a last-minute anti-abortion amendment to the bill, prompting Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear to veto it. The legislature eventually overrode his veto. Midwifery advocates hope the new law will help make it easier to open a birth center in the state.
Georgia legislators similarly revised Georgia’s certificate of need rules in 2024, exempting freestanding birth centers. Chubb, who championed the new law, hoped it would clear the path for herself and others.
But they hit another roadblock. The state still requires birth centers to secure a written agreement with a local hospital to accept transfers of clients in emergencies. Chubb and at least one other prospective birth center owner have been unable to get their local hospitals to sign such transfer agreements.
“We’re still fighting,” Chubb said. “Behind closed doors we’re still working very hard on getting legislation and regulations changed to make opening birth centers more equitable.”
Some hospitals view birth centers as a threat to the viability of their labor and delivery units, siphoning off patients and revenue from a service that’s already unprofitable for most hospitals.
Daniel Grigg, CEO of Wallowa Memorial Hospital, a 25-bed critical access hospital in northeast Oregon, said there aren’t enough births in the area for both hospitals and birth centers.
“When you’ve got a small-volume community like we have, every birth helps the providers keep their skills up and their competency,” he said. “When you’ve got a midwife taking, say, 10 patients out of that pool,” it can have an impact on physicians and hospitals.
Alabama lawsuit
After the Alabama Department of Public Health shut down Skanes’ birth center in 2023, she joined with two other women who had also been attempting to open birth centers in Alabama: Dr. Yashica Robinson, an OB-GYN in North Alabama, and Stephanie Mitchell, a licensed midwife in Alabama’s rural and economically disadvantaged Black Belt region. Together they sued the Alabama Department of Public Health over what they called a de facto ban on birth centers.
The state insisted its tighter regulations would ensure that birth center facilities are safe. The birth center owners said the state’s rules were overly burdensome and clinically unnecessary for the low-risk, nonsurgical births that are attended by midwives. And, they said, the rules prevented more families from accessing care where it’s desperately needed. The state has lost at least three hospital labor and delivery units since 2020.
“Entire swaths of the state are maternity care deserts without access to essential health care,” said Whitney White, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the birth center owners and their co-plaintiff, the Alabama affiliate of the American College of Nurse-Midwives.
“Hospital labor and delivery units are closing, and pregnant folks are reporting they’re really struggling to access the care they need, struggling to get appointments, struggling to find a provider,” White said.
US hospitals see stark decline of obstetric services, study shows

Last May, an Alabama trial court permanently blocked the state from regulating freestanding birth centers as hospitals. Birth center staff are still overseen by state boards of midwifery and nursing.
All three Alabama centers are now open. But their licensed midwives are delivering babies under a cloud of uncertainty about the future.
The state appealed the ruling in November. The case is ongoing.
Struggles and solutions
Bauer, of the American Association of Birth Centers, said many centers face the same financial barriers. Uncomplicated births at freestanding birth centers cost less than they do at hospitals, but research has shown that insurers, including Medicaid, reimburse centers at lower rates. Some state Medicaid programs don’t cover some of the nonclinical services, such as lactation consultants and doulas, that birth centers may provide. And malpractice premiums are rising.
“We’re volunteering our time, essentially, to keep the birth center open as a service to the community,” said Sarah Simmons, co-owner of Maple Street Birth Center in rural Okanogan County, Washington. The center can’t afford to hire a front-desk staffer or another midwife, Simmons said. She added that on average, the center makes less than a third of what the local hospital makes for providing the same obstetric service.
But there may be solutions to some of these financial problems. For example, the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a national health care policy center, has recommended that health insurance plans, both Medicaid and commercial, pay hospitals and birth centers monthly or quarterly “standby capacity payments” per woman of childbearing age covered by that health plan in the facility’s service area. It also recommends that plans pay a separate delivery fee for each birth.
In 2024, Democratic U.S. senators proposed a bill to allow for a similar payment model.
Standby payments could help freestanding birth centers, especially those that fill gaps in maternity care deserts — but not unless centers receive payments that are comparable to those that hospitals get, said Simmons, whose center serves four sparsely populated counties along with the Colville tribal communities.
“This would be most beneficial to freestanding birth centers if pay parity laws were enforced, so rural freestanding birth centers were paid the same rates for the same services as rural hospitals, ” she said.
State grants also can help, but birth centers say a one-time infusion won’t be enough. In 2024, Washington opened grant applications for distressed hospital labor and delivery units and freestanding birth centers.
Ashley Jones, of True North Birth Center and president of the Washington chapter of the American Association of Birth Centers, said the grant has helped keep their doors open.
Meanwhile, Chubb, the Georgia nurse, recently had to take another job to support her family while her birth center remains in legal limbo.
“I’m just waiting until the government figures out what they’re doing.”

(Getty Images)As Americans struggle to afford groceries and utilities, a new study finds that three Ohio cities are among the most expensive for another essential — medical care. 
Cleveland, Toledo and Cincinnati are in the top 11 in terms of how big a bite medical expenses take out of their incomes, according to a WalletHub analysis of the 100 largest American cities.
For decades, inflating health care costs have far outpaced inflation in the economy as a whole. Between 2000 and 2024, the cost of medical care rose 121%, compared to 86% for the overall economy, according to the Peterson-KFF Health Tracker. 
Meanwhile, grocery prices have jumped more than 29% since 2020 with “no end in sight,” NPR reported in September. And many Ohio electricity consumers have seen increases as high as 44% just this year, according to Consumer Energy Solutions.
Ohioans’ pay hasn’t kept up. Adjusted for inflation, median annual income has actually dropped from about $71,000 in 2019 to $67,873 four years later, according to the Ohio Housing Finance Agency.

All of that is leaving families in a bind, the WalletHub report said.
“As health care gets increasingly more expensive, more and more people find themselves struggling to afford essential services and medicines,” it quoted analyst Chip Lupo as saying. “While some cities have lower prices than others, the average income in many places still may not be enough to keep up with the costs, especially when consumers have also faced inflated prices across all other facets of their budgets over the past few years.”
So it’s not great news that some Ohio cities are among the nation’s most expensive when it comes to health care. 
WalletHub analyzed data collected in November by the Census Bureau and the Council for Community and Economic Research. 
It compared the cost of doctor, dentist and optometrist visits as well the prices of ibuprofen and insulin glargine in each of the 100 largest cities. It then expressed those costs as a percentage of the cities’ median annual incomes.
Cleveland had the dubious distinction of coming in second, with medical costs making up 11.35% of median monthly household income. 
“This is largely due to the fact that Cleveland has the lowest median household income in the country, at $39,187 per year,” the report said, adding that medicine prices were relatively high in the city, while the cost of provider visits was relatively low.
Toledo came in fourth on the list, with medical costs making up 11.03% of median monthly income, and Cincinnati was 11th, at 8.98%. Columbus was 64th at 6.09%, putting it in the lower-cost half of big cities.

The fate of child care in Ohio is also impacted by federal decisions, including funding for Head Start programs and a Child Care and Development Block Grant.
Advocates say the recent government shutdown already caused issues in a field that’s struggling to keep up with demand and costs.
“The disruption to Ohio’s federally funded Head Start programs in 2025 – proposed budget cuts and the destabilizing government shutdown – was unprecedented,” said Julie Stone, executive director of the Ohio Head Start Association, Inc.
With Congress’ Jan. 30 deadline to yet again pass a federal spending bill, the potential for future struggles is mounting.
“Ohio’s children, families, providers, and communities are counting on strong federal investments and stable, year-round funding,” the child advocacy group Groundwork Ohio wrote in a fundraising email to supporters this month.
Groundwork’s president and CEO, Lynanne Gutierrez, said they are holding on to hope that agreement can be made on the federal level. Plus, with a strong infrastructure at the state level, she said there’s lots of data that can inform the work of the next governor, whoever that may end up being.
While the major-party candidates have not been officially decided yet, Gutierrez said her group has had conversations with the campaigns of both Dr. Amy Acton and Vivek Ramaswamy, gubernatorial candidates on the Democratic and Republican sides respectively.
“We see opportunities with both candidates, because this really is a bipartisan issue,” Gutierrez told the Capital Journal. “We’re committed to being a partner to whoever the next governor is.”
State funding will be a big part of the 2026 strategy for child care advocates, as they face a $600 million budget shortfall that will hit in 2028 as one-time federal funding goes away, according to Gutierrez.
“We believe that, just sort of back of the envelope math, that gap will mean there’s 30,000 kids per year who would lose access to care,” Gutierrez said.
Head Start leaders share the concern around the funding shortfall, and Stone said the strength of Head Start’s services “will be crucial to maximizing family access to care.”
As for state funding, the most recent state operating budget left eligibility for the Publicly Funded Child Care program at 145% of the federal poverty level, despite calls for the level to be raised to 160% or even 200%.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXA cost-sharing model called the Child Care Cred Program that splits child care costs among the state, employers and employees who apply for the program received a $10 million appropriation. The budget provision started out as GOP-led legislation in both the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate, but policy analysts say other states who have tried the program have seen “lackluster” results.
The Child Care Choice Voucher Program also received $50 million over the next two years in the state budget. The money will come from federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant funds.
While grant programs to support recruitment and mentorship in the child care sector were included in the budget, the amounts the state contributed to them went from as much as $3.2 million in House budget drafts, down to $2.85 million in the final budget.
There’s going to be a harder lift as the new year begins, partly because the incremental funding changes advocates have attempted to persuade the Ohio legislature to take have fallen by the wayside, leaving the large gap, a number of that could prove too eye-popping for policymakers to take on.
“I’m sure we’re not the only (sector) with a funding gap, and there’s not going to be new federal money that’s going to be able to cover this gap,” Gutierrez said.
Accessibility and affordability continue to be issues for child care providers and families alike. According to a 2025 child care survey of central Ohio conducted by the Ohio-based non-profit Action for Children, 16% of providers in that area are unsure whether they will remain open in the next three months, a 5% increase from 2024 data.
“Providers have even deeper concerns about long-term stability, with over half (58%) of all providers unsure if they will be open in the next 12 months, without additional public support,” the report stated.
The research found that nearly half of the providers who participated in the report say their monthly revenue doesn’t cover expenses. The providers are also seeing less-than-capacity enrollment, with about 70% enrollment from facility to facility.
“Under-enrollment can cause financial challenges for child care providers who often operate on thin margins even when fully enrolled,” the report stated. “Lack of full enrollment can put the program at risk of closure, and so, decrease stability for the families it serves, and exacerbate shortages of affordable, quality care.”
The cost of child care has been debated by the legislature for years, with various bills attempted, from cost-sharing models to family tax credits. But with state funding dips and federal money being cut or fading away, struggles may continue for families who need the care.
The Action for Children study found child care to be “out of reach” for many households in central Ohio, and for those who can afford it, it’s “often their largest single monthly expense.”
In Franklin County, for example, the lowest median cost of child care makes up 14.6% of the average income in the county, where the median household income is $1,367 per week.
Gutierrez said driving down cost will of course be a big part of Groundwork’s work within the legislature next year.
“Affordability is the number one for families … (we’re) looking at both child care and potential child tax credit policies to help hard-working families,” she said.

Former Ohio Department of Health director Dr. Amy Acton is running as a Democratic candidate for governor. Former Congressman Tim Ryan announced he will not run for governor, essentially clearing a path for Acton to be the Democratic nominee.   
Acton has received nominations from the Ohio Federation of Teachers, Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, the Ohio Association of Public School Employees, AFSCME Ohio Council 8, former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, and the United Auto Workers.
There are two Republican candidates running for governor — entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and political newcomer Casey Putsch. The Ohio Republican Party officially endorsed Ramaswamy in May 2025.
Ramaswamy has secured trade union endorsements including the Ohio Teamsters Union and the Central Regional Council of Carpenters. President Donald Trump and the Center for Christian Virtue’s president have also endorsed Ramaswamy, who ran for president in 2024. 
Putsch lives in northwest Ohio and is a founder of the nonprofit Genius Garage car charity.  
Political newcomer Heather Hill is also running for governor as an independent after leaving the Republican party. 
Former Democratic state Rep. Elliot Forhan and John Kulewicz, a retired attorney and Upper Arlington City Council member, are running in the Democratic primary for Ohio attorney general. Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is also running for attorney general. 
Democratic Ohio House state Rep. Allison Russo and Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, are running in the Democratic primary for secretary of state.
Current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague and retired Air Force intel officer Marcell Strbich are running in the Republican primary for secretary of state. 
Current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for state auditor in 2026. 
A Republican primary for the nomination for Ohio treasurer includes former state Sen. Niraj Antani, current state Sen. Kristina Roegner, former state Rep. Jay Edwards, and Lake County Treasurer Michael Zuren.
No Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor or treasurer. 
Two Ohio Supreme Court races will be on the 2026 ballot.
Democratic Ohio Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Brunner is being challenged by four Republicans competing in a primary — former Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Colleen O’Donnell, Fifth District Court of Appeals Judge Andrew King, Second District Court of Appeals Judge Ron Lewis, and State Appellate Judge Jill Flagg Lanzinger. 
Brunner is the only Democratic judge on the 6-1 Ohio Supreme Court. 
Republican Ohio Supreme Court Justice Dan Hawkins is up for reelection next year against Democratic candidate First District Court of Appeals Judge Marilyn Zayas, who previously ran unsuccessfully for Ohio Supreme Court in 2022 when she lost to Justice Pat DeWine by a 13% margin. 
The filing deadline to run for Ohio office is Feb. 4, Ohio’s primary election is May 5, and the general election is Nov. 3. 
The last time a Democratic candidate won any of Ohio statewide executive offices was back in 2006 when Ted Strickland was elected governor, Marc Dann was elected attorney general, Richard Cordray was elected treasurer, and Jennifer Bruner was elected secretary of state. 
Also in 2026, former Ohio Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown will challenge appointed Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, who replaced JD Vance in the chamber. Husted is seeking his first election to the position.

Simón Bolívar, ""the Liberator,"" to support the U.S. raid on Venezuela over the weekend, just one day after opponents of the move rallied near the White House.","Supporters of the U.S. raid on Venezuela rallied Sunday at the monument to Gen.

A small group of Venezuelans, their loved ones and advocates gathered Sunday at the Gen. Simón Bolívar Memorial near the National Mall to celebrate the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.
President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that U.S. military forces captured Maduro and Flores in an overnight raid on their home. Both were brought to the U.S., where they face narco-terrorism charges.
The U.S.’ overnight military operation knocked out electricity in parts of Venezuela’s capital of Caracas and included strikes on military installations. That was followed by Trump’s remarks Saturday that the U.S. would “run” Venezuela in the interim.
Many in the U.S., however, remain divided over Trump’s invasion and capture of another country’s leader, especially considering the lack of congressional approval to carry out the operation. Critics worry it will drag the U.S. into another costly war, saying the president is only doing this to gain access to Venezuelan oil.
But, Maduro’s capture is also being welcomed by many Venezuelans as he is widely seen by opponents — within his country and by foreign governments — as having illegitimately won Venezuela’s 2024 election.

‘The usurper president’
In attendance was Gabriela Montero, an award-winning Venezuelan pianist and human rights advocate who performed at the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony for Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado.

“This is not a matter of the U.S. coming in and taking our riches and taking our resources. This is about removing from office a group, and in this case, right now, the usurper president, and allowing, in this next phase, a space for a transition which will finally lead the road to our freedom,” Montero said.
When asked if he had any reservations about U.S. military action in Venezuela, Montero’s husband Sam McElroy responded, “none, whatsoever.”
“I can fully understand why people, for example, are concerned about the extrajudicial nature of the bombing of the boats, and how this was done without an act of Congress, or without consulting Congress. But, you also have to deal with the problem as you see it and as you find it,” McElroy said.
“It was an extraction of two criminals, not an extraction of a president, because he’s not the president of Venezuela,” he said. “He was the illegitimate usurper, a criminal who was extracted. So we must get that right.”
Both Montero and McElroy consider Edmundo González to be the legitimate winner of the 2024 presidential election.
“Venezuelans, we have, for the last 20-plus years, voted. We’ve marched. We’ve tried to find our way to democracy through democratic means,” Montero said.
“We’ve done everything that was required of us as a peaceful people without the arms that the military and the government, unfortunately, own, and we’ve done everything that we could to be able to free ourselves and to become a democratic state again, and it’s been impossible.”
Carlos Figueroa attended Sunday’s celebration with his family.
He expressed gratitude to the Trump administration, saying he never thought he’d see Maduro brought to justice for creating “unbearable conditions” in Venezuela. He said that after decades, many Venezuelans who initially fled the country will feel safe coming home.
“The rule of law is not yet restored in the country. When that happens, then, of course, millions of Venezuelans will return back. And, definitely, that’s my expectation too,” Figueroa said.
‘Hands off Venezuela’
Just blocks away at the White House, another small group gathered, but with different intentions: To protest both U.S. military action in Venezuela and the capturing of Maduro and Flores.

Robbie McLuckie was part of that group. He held a sign reading, “Hands off Venezuela.”
“I’m just really concerned about the military action on Venezuela. I think it should have gone through Congress, and the Trump administration took unilateral action and impacted the sovereign rights of another country,” McLuckie said.
“Obviously, Maduro is a complicated, bad guy. He wasn’t a good leader. He mistreated his people. But, that doesn’t mean we need to be invading other people’s countries without congressional approval, kidnapping their leader, and bringing them back. I think that’s really scary.”
Also part of that group was a demonstrator named Jose, who shared similar concerns.
“We know very well that, you know, the natural resources are one of the primary interests to do all these kinds of attacks,” Jose said.
“You know, I’m from Bolivia, and Bolivia, we have one of the biggest resources of lithium, and we know that this is going to happen to us,” he said. “If that happened to Venezuela, we are next.”
But Venezuelans, like Montero and Figueroa, remain steadfast in their support for the Trump administration’s operation.
“A lot of people think they understand Venezuela. They’ve just arrived in the conversation. We’ve been in this fight for 27 years,” Montero said.
“Ask a Venezuelan, ask us what our story is, ask us how much we suffered and we’ve lost. Ask us, you know, to inform you, to educate you,” she said. “Don’t presume to know, because this is a complex situation.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)As 2026 begins, so does the second year of Maine’s two-year legislative session.
The official start of the second regular session of the 132nd Legislature is Jan. 7, but throughout the fall the 35 members of the Maine Senate and 151 members of the House of Representatives have been revising proposals and introducing emergency measures with the guidance of analysts and other staff. 
Most legislation is proposed before the start of the two-year cycle, ahead of what is referred to as the “long session,” which typically lasts from January through June. 
This year’s “short session” — scheduled to end on April 15, though it’s possible it’ll run longer — will be focused on legislation carried over from 2025, with some new proposals, including a supplemental budget.  
Legislation 
During the first year of the 132nd Legislature in 2025, legislators passed a biennial budget and a budget addition, as well as hundreds of new laws, which added protections from ticket scams, prohibited the doxing of children, and shielded health care providers by allowing them to remove their names from the label of abortion drugs, among other things.  
But lawmakers and the governor pushed off the fate of hundreds of other bills to the second regular session. 
Gov. Janet Mills postponed her decision on 61 bills that have already passed both chambers of the Legislature, such as proposals to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following the state’s largest toxic foam spill in Brunswick.
Mills can either veto these bills within the first three days of the next session or allow them to become law without her signature after that. 
She’s already announced her intention to allow at least two to become law: one that will restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement and another that will require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns.
The 61 bills being held are in addition to nearly 400 that the Legislature opted to carry over into next year. That legislation includes all of the measures that were left on what are referred to as the appropriations and study tables. The bills that end up on these tables have largely passed the full Legislature but still needed to vie for remaining funding, or in the case of studies, legislative staff in order to help conduct them. 
The House and Senate will also consider some new proposals the Legislative Council, a group composed of the ten legislative leaders, approved in the fall. 
For example, the council accepted a bill from Senate Assistant Majority Leader Jill Duson (D-Cumberland) that seeks to protect due process in immigration detentions. 
Each bill is assigned to one of the 17 joint legislative committees, which hold public hearings and work sessions and then cast votes that serve as recommendations for how the full Legislature should vote. But, the full Legislature doesn’t always agree with the committee. 
The chamber in which a bill’s sponsor resides determines whether the House or Senate takes a bill up first. Legislation has to make it through both the chambers (​​which means passing at least four steps on the floor in each: first reading, second reading, engrossment and enactment) in order to get to the governor, who can either sign the bill, allow it to become law without her signature or veto it. 
If Mills does the latter, lawmakers can override a veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber, though the Legislature has so far never done this during her tenure. 
But, there are also other — less visible — ways bills can die. Notably, the appropriations table, where bills are placed to vie for remaining funding if not funded in the budget. (During the 131st Legislature, less than 10% of bills placed on the appropriations table ultimately became law.)
Any bills the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee decides to fund off the table still need approval again by the full Legislature and ultimately the governor. 
Budget 
Each legislative session, lawmakers are tasked with passing a biennial budget in the first year and a supplemental budget in the second year to adjust for changes in revenue or priorities. 
There remains a fair amount of economic uncertainty as the governor and lawmakers begin to debate adjustments. 
The state is expected to take in nearly $250 million more over the next two years than previously estimated. But as Maine State Economist Amanda Rector said during a Dec. 15 briefing to the appropriations committee, “It is important to bear in mind that there is a high degree of risk associated with the forecast as a result of the extremely uncertain economic environment we continue to face,” noting federal changes such as tariffs and a lack of jobs and inflation data, among overall economic unpredictability.  
The governor proposes her budget plan first, which she submits to lawmakers, specifically the appropriations committee. The appropriations committee then holds public hearings on each part of the plan before it puts forth a budget bill to be considered by the full Legislature.  
Unlike the federal government, which can take on debt, the governor is required to propose a balanced budget. The Legislature then bears the responsibility of enacting a budget — in conjunction with all other spending bills — in which spending doesn’t exceed available resources in those specific fiscal years.
Like other bills, the budget bill can either pass as an emergency measure, which requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers and would allow it to take effect immediately upon approval by the governor, or as a non-emergency measure, which only requires a majority vote in both chambers and would result in the bill taking effect 90 days after the Legislature adjourns. 
Last session, the Democratic majority passed both the initial biennial budget that largely continued funding at the same levels and the budget addition that later added policy changes without Republican support.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which the White House said will be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center.  (Photo courtesy of Kennedy Center)Nebraskans will remember 2025 as a year when grocery, coffee shop or online retail receipts got them in touch with “affordability” … or lack thereof. As we begin a new year, all of us should consider other meanings for the word. 
To wit: CBS’s “60 Minutes” ranks among television’s most iconic programs. Its long, well-respected run began five years after the assasination of John F. Kennedy. Both benchmarks are back in headlines … reminding us of what we can’t afford.
As widely reported, the new, inexperienced editor-in-chief at CBS News killed a “60 Minutes” segment last month that exposed serious problems in the administration’s immigration enforcement practices. 
The piece’s cutting came on the heels of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts board — handpicked by the president — added his name to the building, which is a memorial to JFK. 
I rarely write about other media, lest readers confuse criticism with a cheap shot or praise with professional bias. I’ll take that chance here because the “60 Minutes” dustup is more than simply looking at one piece of journalism. 
It’s about whether journalists can continue practicing their profession as they have since 1791, when we ratified the Bill of Rights. If you’re keeping score at home, the Fourth Estate has been at it about 235 years. 
You know the particulars: No government interference with citizens’ rights and freedom to be informed … as we do also with speech, assembly, prayer and petitioning. 
The government did not directly spike the “60 Minutes” story, which was about the country deporting immigrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The reporter has publicly denounced the decision as political rather than journalistic. 
Her boss argued that the story should be held until the reporter obtained comments from the administration, something the reporter had sought several times but got no response. 
The reporter wrote, rightly, that if officials can undo a story by not commenting when given the chance, they effectively have a “kill switch” for any piece with which they might disagree.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Journalism holds accountable those in power, who spend taxpayer money, make and enforce laws by which we live, govern according to the Constitution and are responsible for safeguarding the rights of those who gave them such power. 
When “news” capitulates in the face of government displeasure or criticism — before or after the fact — freedom is restricted and information filtered or erased. In a democracy, that’s simply unaffordable, a price too steep to pay.
The postscript to the “60 Minutes” hullabaloo was a modern “miracle.” CBS had already sent the segment to a Canadian streaming service, where it was promptly bootlegged and shone all over the internet. It’s a solid piece of journalism, well-reported and neither sensational nor unseemly. What we’ve come to expect from “60 Minutes.” The hope is that we can continue to do so.
Slapping another name on the Kennedy Center fails any number of tests, not the least of which is that only Congress, because federal law created the place, can effect such a change. The president and the center’s board know that, legal principles apparently be damned.
Other failures are at work here. One is history. In 1955 President Eisenhower appointed a commission to consider a new public center for the performing arts in the nation’s capital. That culminated in the National Cultural Center Act passed in 1958. As president, JFK led the effort to raise funds to build the center. 
After his assasination, federal legislation renamed what was then the National Cultural Center to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a “living memorial” to the former president. 
Attaching another name, even a twice-elected president who had nothing to do with the center’s inception and spirit, chafes against this history and simple good taste. Just last week, when the Kennedys were mourning the loss of JFK’s granddaughter, the president belittled their support of the center.
Not that long ago we witnessed much political hand-wringing about government overreach, nefarious plots and ploys we were told unnecessarily injected the feds’ reach where it didn’t belong. The worry? The government was meddling in our personal lives, changing the rules and costing us our freedoms.
Overreach can happen in other ways, too. When, for example, the government casts a large shadow over the reporting of the news. Or it decides that the rules and regulations of the institutions and infrastructures on which our politics and our way of life operate can be ignored or flouted.
A democratic republic like ours, in its 250th year, can afford neither.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)It’s a new year here in the Free State of Florida and you’re freer than ever!
Free to tote guns; free to kill bears; free to drain and pave; free to call ICE if you spy some brown-complected fellows in the Home Depot parking lot.
Most of all, you’re free to make New Year’s Resolutions.
Not the usual crap about getting more exercise, practicing mindfulness, adding legumes to your diet or volunteering.
Nonsense.
We’re Americans: selfish, lazy, and overweight.
Now, I don’t know what resolutions your elected officials and other powerful Florida folk have made, but here are a few guesses and predictions for the Year of Our Lord 2026.
Assuming there’s not a world-wide conflagration, an almighty flood, or a plague of frogs, in which case all bets are off.
1. In preparation for a 2028 presidential run, Gov. Ronald Dion DeSantis will resolve to learn to smile properly.
And be nice.
Or nice-adjacent.
As you recall, voters didn’t exactly warm to him in 2024. He was, as one columnist put it, “an all-around odd duck and not in a good way.”
The solution? Charm School!
Avenues of Excellence in Coral Gables offers private lessons in everything from social discourse to how one does and does not eat one’s chocolate pudding.
2. Sen. Stan McClain and Rep. Dean Black resolve that in 2026 they will protect Florida’s Confederate monuments, slapping fines on Damn Yankees who dare try and remove them.
It didn’t pass last year but, by God and General Lee, the bill will be heard in the Legislature this year.
Why not go bigger? Get more Confederate names back on schools and roads.
Ditch the “Barack Obama” and “Harriet Tubman” street signs and return to calling the Old Dixie Highway the Old Dixie Highway.
The Pentagon has brought the names of Confederate generals Bragg and Benning back to the military bases where they belong. (There was a federal law against that, so Pete Hegseth found some people with the same last names that he could borrow.)
Now, how about righting the wrong done to Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest? Jacksonville wokesters forced N.B. Forrest High School to change its name to “Westside.”
Political correctness run amok.
Forrest was a valiant soldier, a human resources entrepreneur (some called it “slave trading”) and, as Grand Wizard of the Invisible Empire, a pioneering anti-DEI campaigner.
3. How ’bout them ’Noles!
I do not mean this in a good way.
FSU’s once-vaunted football team did not cover itself in glory this season.
Nor did the University of Florida’s: The Gators went 4-8; the Seminoles 5-7.
A couple of directional colleges went to bowls: FIU appeared in the Servpro First Responder Bowl (lost) and USF in the StaffDNA Cure Bowl (also lost).
On the plus side, the ever-annoying University of Miami beat the even-more-annoying Ohio State in the first playoff.
But Texas had eight teams in post-season play.
Texas. Eight.
Florida athletic programs are struggling. They have to build indoor practice facilities. They have to hire a coach and pay him millions, then millions more when they fire him.
It’s tough.
Therefore, every Floridian must resolve to give generously to the Name, Image, and Likeness Collective of their choice to help buy the best players in the nation.
While you’re at it, you can support some of their proud sponsors, including Cambio Tequila and Social House Vodka.
4. Why don’t we all pitch in and help ban more books this year?
Local cranks and Moms for Liberty can’t do all the work.
Many of Toni Morrison’s books are off the shelves, as well as “Slaughterhouse Five,” Kurt Vonnegut’s mind-bending anti-war novel, which one Mom for Liberty called “shocking and perverse.”
She elaborated: “I don’t think [my daughter] needs to fill her head with pictures and ideas of Shetland ponies having sex with girls.”
Still, too many works of literature remain unbanned.
John Keats’ 1820 poem “The Eve of St. Agnes,” for example, which promotes unmarried sex and the eating of strange, possibly hallucinogenic, foodstuffs: “spiced dainties” and “lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon.”
Or “Moby Dick” (that title!) which depicts two men sleeping in the same bed and calling each other “husband and wife.”
Or William Faulkner’s “Go Down, Moses,” a Critical Race Theory novel which implies that slavery was really quite bad.
Get to work, people. Make 2026 the year our children read nothing but the clean-ish bits of the Bible.
5. Members of Florida’s well-upholstered “developer community” make the same resolution every New Year’s: erect strip malls, big box stores, golf courses, and ticky-tack exurban “communities” on what’s left of Florida’s unspoiled lands.
I wouldn’t be surprised if they inscribed their vow in the blood of road-kill critters on sheep skin.
Even though tiresome “knee-jerk obstructionists” (as one legislator calls people who care about clean water, habitat destruction, and sprawl) fight back.
Sometimes the tree-huggers even win.
As the Phoenix’s Craig Pittman reported, the Sarasota Audubon Club stopped the nation’s largest homebuilder from parking 170 houses next to a bird sanctuary.
In Orange County, enraged residents said a big hell no to a Texas outfit planning to build an 1,800-house monstrosity on land zoned rural.
But this year, developers are getting a little help from their friends in the Florida Legislature.
The peoples’ representatives plan to push through a brace of bills that would hamstring the public’s ability to object to developments, allow city or county administrators – not elected commissioners, answerable to the voters – to approve projects, and override local government.
No opportunity for corruption there, no sir.
6, The Florida Democratic Party (Yes! It still exists!) also makes the same resolution every New Year’s: Win an election.
Any election.
And dang, if they didn’t snag one in 2025!
A non-Republican female human beat a Donald-Trump-and-Ron-DeSantis-endorsed Republican male person to become mayor of Miami.
Republicans were typically gracious in defeat.
The Miami-Dade County Party Chairman said, Democrats were “making a mountain out of a molehill.
“It’s not a rebuke of the president or the party. Democratic city elects Democratic mayor.”
Even though this Democratic city hasn’t elected a Democratic mayor in 28 years.
If nothing else, it may perk up our Donkey friends.
A little.
David Jolly, a former U.S representative and former Republican, is running for governor as a Democrat.
But Rep. Byron Donalds, Donald Trump’s preferred candidate, leads in the polls.
As befits a MAGA man, Donalds is given to saying things divorced from both history and intelligence.
Perhaps you are unaware that, while Jim Crow wasn’t great, at least “the Black family was together” and politically “conservative.”
Never mind the lynchings.
7. Speaking of the gubernatorial race, the Republican Party of Florida might consider worrying about the upstart candidacy of one James Fishback, a 31-year-old Elon Musk fanboy now being sued by his former hedge fund employer.
Fishback’s building name recognition in a peculiar way, getting thrown out of an economic conference for confronting Federal Reserve board member Lisa Cook (the one Trump keeps trying to fire), demanding foreign students pay $1 million a year in tuition at Florida universities, and calling Byron Donalds a “slave” and “DEI Donalds.”
Combustible Florida U.S. Rep. Rep. Randy Fine, who was once ordered by a judge to attend anger management classes, and who said Palestinians in Gaza should “starve away,” calls Fishback “a total weirdo.”
Obviously, he’s an exemplary MAGA candidate.
8. The governor and the grim band of anti-intellectuals who rule higher education in Florida have yet to declare this resolution out loud, but it’s pretty clear they want 2026 to be the year they turn all our universities into New College.
Once a highly regarded liberal arts school where non-traditional students – outside-the-box thinkers, gay kids, trans kids, arty kids – were as welcome as more mainstream students, where learning was creative, not prescriptive, New College is now sad and second-rate.
Determined to quash academic freedom across the state system, DeSantis has installed ideologically aligned presidents at UWF, USF, FIU, FAU, and FAMU.
The interim (soon to be permanent) president of the University of Florida, a climate change skeptic, has ordered UF to be “institutionally neutral.”
What he means is “conservative.”
UF has shut down its Department of Environmental Horticulture (“environmental” is a bad word), abolished its Center for Inclusion and Multicultural Engagement, and shuttered its Office of Sustainability.
Many humanities and social sciences programs are endangered, too.
But the spanking new Hamilton School for Classical and Civic Education, run by the very conservative former state Supreme Court chief justice Charles Canady and endowed by, among others, by the right-wing Council on University Reform and billionaire DeSantis donor Ken Griffin gets all the money it wants.
Institutional neutrality roars into the future, charged with teaching the superiority of Western Civilization.
All I can say is Happy New Year, y’all.
And good luck.
We’ll need it.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0934-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 00:11:42.031318

We do little to prevent this, so there is only one plausible conclusion: We are okay with it.","Last month Abdulah Kanchero, of New Haven, and Francisco J. Diaz-Aquino and Johanna  Beatriz Navas-Gonzalez, of Stamford, died in the cold, unsheltered.
On the night Kanchero passed, the Unhoused Activist Community Team (UACT), including 18 people who had been turned away from full warming centers, occupied New Haven City Hall. After sending police to throw everyone out into the frigid night, the administration relented and opened an additional overflow warming center in a meeting room in the Hall of Records.
Following the deaths in Stamford, Gov. Ned Lamont released state funding for homelessness services to partially make up for federal cuts in that area.
Whenever the death of an unhoused person makes the news, there is wringing of hands and perhaps token action. Here’s the thing: Winter comes every year; and we know that it will kill about 700 unhoused people in this country. We do so little to prevent these deaths, there is only one plausible conclusion: We are okay with it.
Our economy needs homelessness, to support the commodification of real estate, which makes a few people rich while leaving housing unaffordable for the rest of us, and to keep worker bees buzzing busily. This year the Harris Poll found that 40% of U.S. Americans were dissatisfied with their jobs but would not quit because of fears about an uncertain economy.
“Why work?” you may ask.
“So that you don’t die on a park bench,” is a compelling answer.
Though we need homelessness, most people dislike coming face-to-face with it. My friend Rico, who has frequently lived unsheltered, once told me, “If you’re visible, you’re criminal.” The day before any parade or festival, hit the streets at dawn, and you will see police rounding up unhoused people. Sometimes they take a social worker along for cosmetic purposes, but these workers do not have enough safe accommodations to offer everyone being displaced or arrested for the crime of being poor.
New Haven Police ticketed and arrested U-ACT members and unhoused people on the Green the day the Christmas tree was erected. God bless us, everyone.

Government’s power to criminalize homelessness was bolstered by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Grants Pass decision and an executive order issued by President Donald J. Trump, which I’ve written about in depth elsewhere. When the president acted on that executive order with a militarized response to homelessness in the nation’s capital, unhoused people endured arrest and involuntary psychiatric commitment. Some took refuge deep in the woods, disconnected from any services through which they might have obtained housing.
The point has never been to end homelessness, only to punish people who experience it.
I am part of a crew of volunteers who raised the funds for and continues to support Rosette Neighborhood Village, tiny homes in New Haven for formerly unhoused people. After a tent encampment was demolished by the city, we envisioned a place where that community of neighbors could stay together. We also knew that people need a door to close, for privacy and safety. Modular units were a tenable solution. We put them up in a day for about $20,000 each. That is how you respond to an emergency.
When I visited my friends at Rosette Monday, I explained to one man how to get rid of the condensation in his unit. We’ve had a problem with drips ever since the city ordered United Illuminating to turn off our power and hence the built-in heating. Space heaters don’t warm the units evenly. Condensation results. Ostensibly, the city cut power because we do not meet state building code, which requires an individual kitchen and bathroom in a dwelling unit. (Residents share kitchen and bathroom facilities in the Amistad Catholic Worker House only steps away.)
When we appealed to the state, the city sent its own lawyer and building inspector to argue against our petition. Twice, sympathetic state representatives have introduced enabling legislation for tiny home communities administered by faith groups for unhoused people. But the bills never make it to the floor.
My colleagues came up with a rapid and affordable way to provide dignified transitional housing, without spending a dime of public money. If homelessness is a problem in search of a solution, why wouldn’t our local, state and even national governments be beating a path to our door to learn how to replicate the program?
Simple – because homelessness is not a problem. It’s a strategy to maintain an unjust economic system – and a highly effective strategy at that.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-05 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The job market is broken — and I’m graduating into it,Madisyn Kuhnly,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/05/the-job-market-is-broken-and-im-graduating-into-it/,"I love Connecticut and I want to build a career here, but this state does not do enough to make room for new graduates like me.","I’m a graduating senior majoring in communication at a Connecticut university, and instead of looking forward to the moment I cross the stage, I feel a knot in my stomach every time someone asks, “So, what are your plans after college?” 
The honest answer? I don’t know. And that terrifies me.  
All year, I’ve been doing everything I was told would set me up for success. I’ve been polishing my résumé, networking, taking internships, building a portfolio, and looking at job boards months before graduation. I’ve talked to professors, alumni, and friends. And still, every time I even think about graduation, I spiral. 



I’ve also talked to students who graduated last year, the ones who were sitting exactly where I am now. They tell me the job search is “humiliating,” “exhausting” and, most commonly, “brutal.” One friend applied to over 120 positions before getting a single interview. Another, a strong student I’ve always assumed would thrive, is still unemployed. Several others have jobs that have nothing to do with communications at all: barista, receptionist, retail. 
Sometimes, after hearing about how oversaturated this job market is, I wish I had picked a different major. But now I am in too deep. I have invested four years and thousands of dollars in this path. I cannot just turn back. So instead, I sit with the anxiety of wondering whether all this effort will pay off. 
My fear is not just emotional. It is backed by data, especially for communication and journalism majors. 
Connecticut officials like to point out that there are thousands of job openings. According to the state Department of Labor, there are 80,000 job openings statewide. But when you narrow that to media and communication roles, the picture changes. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that media and communication jobs nationwide are projected to grow more slowly than average. 

Madisyn Kuhnly

According to PR Daily, “The marketing and media/communications sectors have been among the hardest hit since the pandemic. When comparing current job openings to February 2020, they’ve endured drops of 24% and 26%, respectively.” 
Part of the problem is that many “entry-level” communications roles are not entry-level. The National Association of Colleges and Employers found that “even before AI, many entry-level jobs were facing extinction, with 35% of employers posting jobs on LinkedIn requiring three years of experience for them.” 
For communications jobs such as PR assistant, social media coordinator or event coordinator, employers often expect polished portfolios, formal client experience and multiple internships. Many students cannot afford unpaid internships. Many work full-time to pay tuition. Many commute long distances and cannot take low-paying opportunities in New York or Boston. 
We graduate qualified but not experienced enough for jobs meant for recent graduates. 
Even when we apply, we wait. And wait. And wait. 
A 2024 hiring report showed the average hiring timeline was 44 days. Communications roles, which often require writing tests, multiple interviews and portfolio reviews, can take even longer. Job seekers on forums like Reddit complain that they’re still looking for jobs many months after graduation. 
In a state like Connecticut, that timeline is dangerous. According to the United Way of Connecticut, 40% of households in 2023 were ALICE households, people who work but still cannot afford basic needs. Many new graduates fall into that category immediately — not because they are unqualified, but because the system is not built to support them. 
So yes, I am scared. I am scared I will walk across that stage, degree in hand, only to end up lost in the same maze last year’s seniors are still navigating. 
Connecticut can change this story. 
First, employers must stop calling jobs “entry-level” when they require years of experience. If companies want local talent, they must be willing to train us. 
Second, Connecticut’s colleges need real pipelines between communications programs and in-state employers, including marketing agencies, nonprofits, hospitals, universities, state agencies and local media outlets. Communications students should not be left to network or sink. 
Third, the state needs to offer paid internship opportunities, especially in communication, where unpaid internships still dominate.  
Finally, employers must shorten hiring timelines. Even a simple “no” is better than months of silence. 
I love Connecticut. I want to stay here. I want to work here. I want to build a career here. I want to build a family here. But I cannot do any of that if the state and its employers do not make space for graduates like me. 
Graduation should feel like a beginning, not an end. 
I have spent four years earning my communications degree. I just want a fair chance to use it.

Hodge. (Maryland Matters illustration)Today the leaders of states across the country are embroiled in a mid-decade contest to redraw Congressional boundaries that will give their party an advantage in the 2026 election.
It would be very easy for Maryland to get swept up in the fervor of a partisan gerrymandering arms race. But is that the right thing to do?
Bill Ferguson, President of the Maryland State Senate, has offered a wise, principled and practical argument against the idea. The General Assembly should heed his advice when it convenes for the 2026 session.
No one wants to see the election of a Democratic majority in Congress more than I do. But I’m writing today on a matter of principle that transcends party.

Instead of getting down in the mud and wrestling with our political adversaries, let’s defeat them at the polls with better ideas for serving the people and solving the nation’s problems.
Attempting to redraw Maryland’s eight Congressional districts to disenfranchise one-fourth of the State’s voters and deny them a voice in the Congress—in what would likely be a vain attempt to capture the one remaining seat held by a Republican—is not only a fool’s errand. It’s wrong.
This isn’t the Maryland way—or shouldn’t be. In these perilous times for the future of our democratic republic, it’s more important than ever to set an example, remain true to our principles of representative government, and not be lured into a tawdry pursuit of base partisanship that has already compromised the integrity and reputation of the Congress in the eyes of the American people, and poisoned the civility of our politics.
Fifty-two percent of Maryland voters are registered Democrats and control seven of the State’s eight seats in the House of Representatives. Moving Democratic voters from adjacent districts into the 1st Congressional District with the goal of defeating the lone Republican in the Delegation could put our incumbent Democrats at risk.
Experts with long experience running Maryland elections told the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission that it may already be too late to change the Congressional district map if the State hopes to ensure an orderly primary and general election process in 2026.
We can’t control what the leaders of other states do. But we can control what we do. Let our adversaries do their worst, and reveal themselves to the American people in doing so. Let them carry that mud-spattered banner, while we take up the challenge of defeating them with the power of our ideas and our commitment to deliver results that improve the lives of our people.
If America’s political system is broken, let’s dedicate ourselves to fixing it, not deal another blow to its credibility. In Maryland, let’s decide to be leaders—not merely followers in an unworthy cause.
We won’t preserve our democratic ideals and principles by imitating the tactics of political adversaries in other states who are determined to extinguish the voices of their opponents.
The speculative notion that the boundaries of Maryland’s eight House districts can be redrawn to guarantee that they will all be represented by Democrats in the next Congress is a bad bet and a bad idea.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-05 05:56:54.544346

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The Nebraska Medicine board announced Sunday that it had launched an “informational website” aimed at shaping public opinion against letting one of the nonprofit’s owners sell its 50% leadership stake to the other, the University of Nebraska.
The ramping up of the now-public dispute over the group’s future governance comes as the NU Board of Regents prepares for a hearing and possible vote Friday about whether to pay Clarkson Regional Health $500 million for full control.
The regents also will consider a related $300 million transaction for several Clarkson properties in and around the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s midtown Omaha campus, bringing the total price of the buyout to $800 million.
Board argues risks
Nebraska Medicine’s board, steered by people who have led some of the state’s major businesses, appears focused on peeling regents’ support from the proposal. The new website making the group’s argument is www.protectnebraskahealthcare.org.
The site argues, among other things, that compensation for specialists, doctors, nurses and staff could be compromised by state involvement. It seeks more time to find a new private partner for NU to take Clarkson’s place.
Lance Fritz, the former Union Pacific CEO who chairs the Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors, warned in a statement Sunday that ceding control over Nebraska Medicine to the government might put patients and health care providers at risk.
“It’s important that Nebraskans have access to clear and accurate information on this issue,” Fritz said. “We hope this website helps people understand what is being considered and why it is a serious concern.”
NU leaders argue opportunity
NU leaders have argued that patients will see no difference in the quality of care provided or the costs of that care. They argue NU is simply adapting to an ownership structure that reflects most modern academic medical centers.
University leaders, including NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold, have said they do not yet know how much of the $800 million would come from private donors versus public funds. Gold also acknowledged the difficult timing.
The broader NU system also faces the likelihood of additional budget cutting with the State of Nebraska confronting a projected budget shortfall and Gov. Jim Pillen’s push to cut at least $500 million in state spending.
Pillen, a former NU regent whose family runs a hog operation based in Columbus, supports the NU purchase and potential shift in ownership structure. He has said it will protect a vital asset for Nebraskans and their needs.
If the purchase happens, NU would be the sole owner of Nebraska Medicine, which offers hospitals and medical care primarily in eastern Nebraska. Nebraska Medicine’s board has described the push as akin to government healthcare.
Leadership structure questions emerge
Today, NU and Clarkson split leadership on the Nebraska Medicine board. NU says the independent board would still lead UNMC’s medical partner, but it was not immediately clear who would appoint the directors after Clarkson departs.
Following the sale, Clarkson, which helped the university build the core hospital building at 42nd and Dewey Streets, has pledged a $200 million gift to help replace it. Gold said none of the project’s public funding would pull from the budgets of other NU campuses. The campuses together finalized cuts last fall totaling $43 million. 
Clarkson offers NU its half of Nebraska Medicine, properties for $800 million

Clarkson has said it plans to use the purchase-related funds from NU to grow a local private foundation focused on providing grants aimed at making Nebraska the healthiest state in the U.S. and improving how health care is delivered and carried out.
NU leadership is facing questions of its own internally, Gold wrote in an email to UNMC faculty, staff and students on Sunday afternoon. Gold announced a campus forum set for noon Tuesday at UNMC’s Truhlsen Events Center.
Gold shared a frequently asked questions document that seeks to emphasize the university does not intend to change how Nebraska Medicine is managed. The document argues Nebraska Medicine was already run by its owners. It says Nebraska Medicine employees will not become state employees.
“When [Clarkson] began to consider resigning its position in Nebraska Medicine, it approached the Board of Regents to see if the University of Nebraska would be interested in sole-member governance,” Gold wrote. “This is a tremendous opportunity for the University of Nebraska Medical Center.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Members of Montana’s Congressional delegation quickly praised President Donald Trump and the military for the capture Saturday of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, characterized by the administration as head of a drug cartel.
U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, one of three military veterans who are members of the all-Republican delegation, said on social media that Trump acted within his powers to take “decisive military action” against an illegitimate “narco-terrorist dictator.”
“America should not be viewed as conquerer, but rather as a liberator of freedom for the (Venezuelan) people,” Zinke said in a social media post. “With the help of the United States, I am confident they will now be able to use their resources to build a better and more prosperous future.”
Trump announced on Saturday the United States would “run the country” until “a proper transition can take place.”
Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, also was captured, and they both will face a U.S. indictment on narco-terrorism and conspiracy charges levied in 2020, States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C., bureau reported.
Many elected Democrats condemned the strike and said it superseded Congress’ authority to declare war, but in posts on social media, Montana’s delegation defended the action.
“Maduro was an illegitimate dictator and narco-terror kingpin with American blood on his hands,” said U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, who, like Zinke, also served as a U.S. Navy SEAL. “The American people and the Western hemisphere are safer as a result of this operation. Thank you to our brave military and @potus.”
U.S. Air Force veteran and Rep. Troy Downing said the action shows the United States will protect its people.
“Venezuela is a fake narco-state and Nicolas Maduro was a complicit narco operator, both of which posed a direct threat to the health and safety of the American people,” Downing said. “This morning’s targeted operation put the world on notice that the United States will respond with force to criminals and adversaries threatening the safety and welfare of Americans. Peace through strength is the mission.”
States Newsroom’s D.C. bureau said the U.S. and many other countries determined Maduro’s reelection in 2024 was illegitimate.
Trump also has said the operation related to securing oil.

(Photo courtesy of office of U.S Rep Gab Amo)The year is new, but the argument is the same: The Trump administration has no constitutional authority to halt work on a major offshore wind project nearing completion south of Rhode Island’s coastline.
Hundreds of pages of legal filings submitted in federal court on Jan. 1 and 2 by the Revolution Wind developers reprise many of the same arguments already invoked in its August lawsuit against federal regulators. 
The 65-turbine project was already 80% complete when the Trump administration unexpectedly ordered work to stop on Aug. 22, citing national security issues. A month of anguish ensued, with local officials, labor leaders and environmental advocates, along with the companies behind the $5 billion project, decrying the unconstitutional overstep by federal regulators. A federal judge in D.C. stepped in, forcing the Trump administration to back off in a Sept. 22 order. Unlike other litigation between states and companies and the federal government, the order was never appealed.
The rocky seas seemed to calm. Laborers resumed work, and the developers said they were still on schedule to begin providing power to Rhode Island and Connecticut by mid-2026. Offshore installation was scheduled to be completed in mid-February, according to an affidavit from Paul Murphy, senior engineering procurement and construction director for the project. 
Then, three days before Christmas, a new edict from the Trump administration ordered work to stop again on Revolution Wind and four other offshore wind projects along the Atlantic coast. The second, 90-day pause again rested on national security concerns, despite the rigorous review already dubbed complete by the same federal energy agencies years before.
Orsted A/S, the Danish renewable energy giant co-developing Revolution Wind, initially offered a veiled response to the second stop work order. But the hundreds of pages filed in D.C. federal court in the first two days of the year reveal a more forceful fight.
“The Second Stop Work Order is arbitrary and capricious: It is wholly conclusory, internally inconsistent, and overbroad,” states one of the new legal filings, submitted on Jan. 1. “The Second Stop Work Order ignores that the [Department of] Interior has stated plainly that the Project does not interfere with national security. It also ignores Revolution Wind’s obvious and substantial actions and billions of dollars of investment made in reliance.”
Since work resumed in mid-September, developers have finished installing the foundations that anchor the turbines to the sea floor, along with 58 of the 65 turbines, and “substantial completion” of the underwater cables that will connect the wind-powered electricity to the regional grid, according to court filings. Developers now estimate the project is 87% completed — up from 80% in mid-August.
With every day the pause continues, the losses pile up. The companies estimate they are losing $1.44 million a day on already inked contracts with specialty vessels meant to carry heavy equipment and workers out to sea. If the pause is not lifted by Jan. 12, there is a “very high risk” the vessels will no longer be available and the remaining turbines will not be installed by the mandated Jan. 15, 2027 deadline to supply power to Rhode Island, the court filings state.
The development companies are seeking a second preliminary injunction to stop the Trump administration from suspending work on the project, and have also asked to speed up the deliberations.
Royce C. Lamberth, senior judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, agreed to the second request. His Jan. 2 order gives the Department of Justice attorneys representing the federal administration until Thursday, Jan. 8, to submit a response. An in-person hearing in Lamberth’s D.C. courtroom is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Monday, Jan. 12, according to the court docket.

What’s at stake in R.I.
Beyond the $6 billion loss projected by project developers if the project is canceled or left incomplete are the consequences for Rhode Island and Connecticut. On Friday, state and congressional leaders, labor organizers and environmental advocates organized a press conference and rally in downtown Providence to demonstrate their support for the project.
“Rhode Island has built national leadership in offshore wind by doing the hard work and delivering real results,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement following the event. “These projects are essential to keeping energy affordable, creating long-term jobs, strengthening our economy, and meeting our climate goals. We remain committed to an energy future that works for Rhode Island’s workers, families, and businesses.”
More than 2,000 workers, many of them union laborers, have staked their careers on the burgeoning offshore wind industry, aided by specialty training programs including at the Community College of Rhode Island. Since the second stop work order was issued, 200 workers were put on standby for off- and onshore work, according to an affidavit from Melanie Gearon, head of permitting for the project. 
“Just days before the holidays, this administration chose to put thousands of skilled construction workers in limbo – again,” said Michael F. Sabitoni, general secretary-treasurer of the local chapter of the Laborers’ International Union of North America and president of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council. “These are men and women who were counting on this work to support their families and keep food on the table. Offshore wind means union jobs, strong wages, and real economic security. Pulling the plug at the end of the year is reckless and deeply unfair to working families.”

The Ocean State’s ambitious decarbonization mandate, reaching net-zero by 2050, also hinges upon the project’s completion and power for up to 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut. Even states without direct contracts to buy power from the project stand to benefit from a regional electric grid better shielded from the seasonal fluctuations in natural gas prices and availability.
“Stopping these projects ignores both climate science and public support for these projects, and it delays the clean energy transition our communities are counting on,” said Jeff Migneault, executive director of Climate Action Rhode Island. 
The press conference and rally also featured remarks from U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo.
The states’ stakes in the project were the focus of a second federal lawsuit filed by Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general in August. The AGs case was originally filed in Rhode Island federal court, but transferred to D.C. in December, less than two weeks before the second stop work order. No new submissions have been filed in the AGs court case since the latest move by the Trump administration to halt the project, though Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said previously that his office was reviewing the suspension order.
A second Orsted project, Sunrise Wind, under construction off the coast of Long Island, New York, was also subject to the December stop work order. Orsted said in a statement on Jan. 1 that it is still evaluating options for this project, including possible legal proceedings. 
Also affected: Vineyard Wind 1, south of Martha’s Vineyard, Empire Wind 1 off New York’s coastline and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. Developers for Empire Wind and the Virginia project have also filed separate federal lawsuits against the Trump administration for their projects.

Vermont’s congressional delegation condemned the U.S. military’s attack on Venezuela over the weekend that led to the capture of the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, and Vermont Democrats U.S. Sen. Peter Welch and U.S. Rep Becca Balint, all labeled Maduro a brutal authoritarian but said President Donald Trump’s attacks on the South American county exceeded his constitutional authority. 
“Trump’s attack on Venezuela will make the United States and the world less safe. This brazen violation of international law gives a green light to any nation on earth that may wish to attack another country to seize their resources or change their governments,” Sanders said in a statement. 
U.S. forces entered the Venezuelan capital of Caracas overnight Friday into Saturday, and more than 100 U.S. aircraft helped neutralize the country’s air defenses, the New York Times reported. More than 40 people were killed, according to Venezuelan authorities, though Trump said there were no Americans killed in the attack. 
American troops captured both Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, later transporting them out of the country, according to news reports. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro would face charges in the U.S. of narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy, among other charges. 
Trump said Saturday that the U.S. would “run” Venezuela while a transfer of power took place. The details of that plan were not immediately clear, though many of Trump’s comments focused on growing the Venezuelan oil industry.  
Vermont’s top federal lawmakers wasted little time in condemning the military escalation. They had similarly criticized the staging of Vermont Air National Guard members in the Caribbean to support the military buildup against Venezuela. 
“President Trump’s hunger for a regime change war makes it clear he doesn’t care about how this unauthorized and illegal action could cause further chaos and suffering in Venezuela. Has he learned nothing from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya?” Welch said in a statement Saturday. “This could lead us into another forever war, risking the lives of U.S. service members and hurting the economy.”
Balint, in her own statement, said the U.S. had made “these horrible mistakes before.”
“Americans do not want another war,” she said.

Nancy Hunt arrived at an emergency room from a Genesis HealthCare nursing home in Pennsylvania in such dreadful shape, including maggots infesting her gangrened foot, that the hospital called an elder abuse hotline and then the police, her son alleged in a lawsuit.
Hunt died five days later. Her death certificate said the foot injury was a “significant” factor. Genesis denied wrongdoing but agreed to pay $3.5 million in a settlement Hunt’s son signed in August 2024.
Yet Genesis hasn’t paid most of that debt, court records show. It may never have to.

Once the nation’s largest nursing home chain, Genesis says it was spending $8 million a month defending and settling lawsuits over resident injuries and deaths in recent years. But the company is now poised to wipe the liability slate clean by seeking refuge in the most protective corner of the legal system for the nursing home industry: bankruptcy court.
The Genesis case, one of 11 large senior care bankruptcies this year, illustrates how health care companies can dodge public and financial accountability for alleged negligence through delays, confidentiality clauses, and bankruptcy maneuvers, a KFF Health News investigation found.
When it filed for bankruptcy in Dallas in July, Genesis estimated its total liability for nearly a thousand settled and pending lawsuits at $259 million. A KFF Health News review of the terms of 155 settlement agreements and corporate financial statements shows Genesis officials knew insolvency was possible yet included provisions in its settlement agreements allowing it to defer payment, often for a year or more.
As a result, Genesis paid nothing in 85 cases and only a portion in the other 70, according to civil court records and bankruptcy claims made available through people with access to them. It still owes $41 million of the $58 million it had agreed to pay in those cases, the records show.
Nellie Betancourt, shown in a photo with her husband, Gabe, had planned a trip to Las Vegas before she fractured her hip at a Genesis HealthCare rehabilitation center — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. “When she went into that place, I said, ‘Well, she’s going to be taken care of for a few more days and I’ll take her home,’” Gabe says. (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)
“It just feels like they killed my mom and got away with it,” said Vanessa Betancourt, whose mother, Nellie Betancourt, a retired nurse, fractured her hip at a Genesis home in Albuquerque, New Mexico — an injury the medical examiner’s report said led to her death. Genesis agreed to a $650,000 settlement with Betancourt’s family in April under the condition it would not need to pay the first of seven installments for another year, according to the settlement document.

Genesis denied wrongdoing in all lawsuits and settlements. In a written statement, the company did not answer questions about individual personal injury cases. The statement said Genesis remained “focused on delivering high-quality, compassionate care to our patients and residents without disruption” during bankruptcy.
One lawsuit Genesis settled for nearly $1 million alleged nursing home managers ignored repeated warnings about a male resident’s behavior before he sexually assaulted a female Alzheimer’s patient, according to court records. In a case the company resolved for $500,000, a Genesis nursing home was accused of delaying the hospitalization of a resident who had vomited brown mucus. He died of a bowel obstruction. Genesis has paid nothing for either settlement, according to bankruptcy claims.
Creditors, including families of the deceased, are expected to salvage a fraction of what they were promised, if anything. On Dec. 10, the company’s owners were scheduled to seek approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas to sell its nursing homes and other assets to its largest investor, a private equity firm. In court papers, lawyers for residents and other creditors say the complex plan will prevent them from pursuing Genesis’ new ownership and other companies they blame for the company’s collapse.
John Anthony, a bankruptcy attorney representing 340 personal injury claims against Genesis, said, “They never had any intention to honor these deals.”

Low ratings and fines

During years of financial turmoil, Genesis has frequently struggled to provide top-notch care, federal records show. Using its five-star system, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated 58% of homes affiliated with Genesis as below average or much below average. CMS has fined Genesis homes $10 million for violating federal health standards over the past three years.
In 2022, Connecticut health regulators shuttered a Genesis home after two deaths and multiple violations. The company closed another Connecticut nursing home this year after residents twice were evacuated over safety concerns.
In its Chapter 11 filing, Genesis said it cared for about 15,000 residents in 165 nursing homes and 10 assisted living facilities in 18 states. They are centered in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Maine, Alabama, Maryland, and North Carolina, according to the bankruptcy filing.

The company said it owed $709 million in secured debt to lenders and the IRS. Under bankruptcy rules, those debts, backed by Genesis collateral, take precedence over the $1.6 billion in unsecured debt Genesis said it owes. Unsecured creditors include a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia for unpaid provider taxes; and former residents and their families who sued.

Dangers in memory care

Sandia Ridge Center, a Genesis home in Albuquerque, was repeatedly faulted by health regulators for not preventing sexual misbehavior in its memory care unit. In November 2021, CMS cited the home for lacking enough nurses to prevent sexual abuse among residents. An inspection report the following August identified more inappropriate sexual contact. Police were called to investigate sexual assault allegations in February and March of 2023, police reports show; neither resulted in criminal charges.
Then in April 2023, a 61-year-old male resident with alcohol-related dementia sexually assaulted a female resident with Alzheimer’s in the dining room, according to a police report and an inspection report. When the resident screamed for him to stop and that he was hurting her, he responded “shut up bitch I know you like this,” according to a lawsuit brought on behalf of the woman, identified in court papers as R.S.
Sandia Ridge management had been aware of the male resident’s behavioral issues for months, according to employee depositions in the case. Police had investigated a prior sexual assault allegation against him the previous year without bringing charges. In one deposition, a former activities assistant testified he hit her and twice pushed her into a bathroom while announcing, “I want to have sex with you.” When she reported him to a senior Genesis manager, she said in the deposition, the manager put his finger over his lips and said, “Shhh.”
The activities worker testified that R.S. used to happily sing along with Elvis Presley songs. After the assault, the worker said, R.S. “don’t sing anymore.”
Inspectors cited the home for failing to protect R.S. The same report said the home didn’t provide a therapist for another female resident who was being sexually harassed. Medicare fined Sandia Ridge Center $91,247. Genesis denied liability but settled R.S.’ lawsuit for $925,000 in May, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“We just felt we have to hold them accountable,” R.S.’ daughter said in an interview, speaking on the condition that she and her mother not be identified, because of the nature of the assault. “Maybe I’m wrong, maybe I’m naive, but the only way to do that is to sue someone, right?”
Genesis has not paid any of the settlement, according to the family’s claim filing.

Growth and debt

Genesis’ downfall can be traced to 2007, when affiliates of two private equity firms acquired the company in a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout, taking on substantial debt, according to its bankruptcy filing. Private equity also has been involved in other health care bankruptcies, including those of the HCR ManorCare nursing home chain, the prison health care contractor Corizon Health, and two for-profit hospital systems, Steward Health Care and Prospect Medical Holdings.
In 2011, Genesis raised $2.4 billion by transferring substantially all its nursing home buildings and other real estate to Welltower, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, according to Genesis’ bankruptcy filing. Genesis then rented the buildings back from Welltower, which made leasing costs a significant expense.
Genesis went on a nationwide buying spree. At its peak in 2016, it had grown to more than 500 nursing homes. In a court declaration, Louis Robichaux IV, a consultant overseeing Genesis’ bankruptcy restructuring, wrote that as the company expanded, it became harder to manage and “mired in corporate inefficiencies.” Robichaux wrote that Genesis’ financial woes were exacerbated by rapidly increasing labor costs and lawsuits, including some predating the covid pandemic.
Starting in 2021, Genesis avoided bankruptcy after receiving $100 million in loans from a private equity firm founded by Joel Landau, the owner of a Brooklyn-based nursing home chain, according to Robichaux’s filing.
But Genesis continued to teeter on the edge of insolvency. In audited financial statements for 2022 and 2023 submitted to a California oversight agency, management and auditors said rent and debt obligations raised “substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
In a court filing, a committee appointed by the U.S. Trustee’s Office to represent the unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy accused Landau and Welltower of orchestrating a covert plan that allowed Welltower to keep getting its rents while Landau could run the company and “siphon value to himself.” The committee alleged their efforts forced the company into insolvency while “staffing levels and patient care declined precipitously.” Landau and Welltower did not respond to requests for comment.

Drawn-out lawsuits

Erin Pearson sued Genesis over the death of her father, James Sanderson, a retired mining company executive who died in 2018 after spending less than a month at Bear Canyon Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. In the memory care unit, Sanderson fell repeatedly, suffered medication errors made by nursing home staff, and developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis, according to the lawsuit, filed in 2019. Pearson’s lawyers said he was not hospitalized until eight days after nurses noticed he was vomiting brown mucus.

After the judge rejected Genesis’ request to force Pearson into arbitration, Genesis appealed. It took 2½ years before an appeals court affirmed the original decision to let the case go forward in court, records show.
This past May, more than five years after suing, Pearson reached a $500,000 settlement, with the first payment required by November, according to a copy of the agreement. Nothing was paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
“It was so drawn out and for so long,” Pearson said in an interview, calling Genesis’ bankruptcy “despicable.”

Payouts postponed

Jennifer Foote, an Albuquerque attorney who represents clients in multiple lawsuits against Genesis, including Pearson’s, said the company frequently filed appeals. “They did not usually win them on these issues,” she said, “and our sense was that they were doing it as a delay tactic.”
Genesis started using installment payments around 2018, said Dusti Harvey, Foote’s law partner. “The payments wouldn’t start for several months out,” Harvey said. Foote said Genesis’ lawyers often wanted to time the payments to start the month the trial in the case was scheduled to occur.

Families had to wait even when comparatively small amounts of money were involved, settlement agreements show. Genesis’ settlement agreements also included a confidentiality clause prohibiting discussion of the incidents.
Genesis agreed to pay $42,000 in a November 2024 settlement, but the first payment was not due until nine months later. It was not paid, according to the bankruptcy claim.
A $250,000 settlement signed in October 2023 did not start paying out until the following September. When Genesis declared bankruptcy — 21 months after the case was resolved — it still owed $100,000, according to the family’s claim.

‘We never found out the truth’

Settling cases allowed Genesis to avoid the expense and publicity of a trial, at which details of how its nursing homes functioned might have been revealed. In October 2020, Margarett Johnson, a retired school bus driver, fell out of her wheelchair at a Genesis nursing home in Waldorf, Maryland, fracturing her jawbone, nose, and neck, according to a lawsuit brought by her family. Johnson was sent to a trauma center and placed on a ventilator. She died three months later, at age 76, from ventilator-associated pneumonia, the lawsuit said.
“It looked like she was hit by a truck,” Angelina Harley, one of her daughters, said in an interview. “I knew my mom was not going to come home. I knew the Lord was not going to punish her more.”
Genesis HealthCare still owes $112,500 from a $950,000 settlement over the death of Margarett Johnson after an accident in a Maryland nursing home, according to a bankruptcy claim. She is seen here with her brother William Tolson. (Angela Swann)
The company denied negligence and blamed the accident on Johnson’s jacket getting tangled in the wheel of her wheelchair, according to the lawsuit. Harley and her sister Angela Swann were dubious.
“We never found out the truth,” Harley said. “They wanted to settle out of court.”
The company denied liability but agreed to a $950,000 settlement in October 2024. It never paid the final $112,500 installment, according to a letter Johnson’s five children sent to the bankruptcy judge.
“If you settle out of court, you know doggone well you did something wrong,” Harley said.

Maddening judges

By summer 2025, judges in some civil cases had run out of patience.
Alma Brown, a retired day care manager and accordion teacher living in a Genesis nursing home in Clovis, New Mexico, suffered falls, infections, bedsores, and other neglect that hastened her death in 2023, according to her estate’s lawsuit. In Santa Fe District Court, Judge Kathleen McGarry Ellenwood castigated Genesis after it failed to pay $2 million of the $3 million settlement to Brown’s estate or explain the delay.
Genesis “obviously benefited by not having to go to trial,” McGarry Ellenwood said in one hearing, according to a court transcript. “They assure me that they’re not trying to renege on their contract, but it certainly seems like they haven’t lived up to what the bargain was.”
Genesis declared bankruptcy the day McGarry Ellenwood announced she would impose more than $100,000 in fines, plus $10,000 more each day until the settlement was paid.
In Pennsylvania, Greg Hunt petitioned a judge to punish Genesis after it stopped payments of the $3.5 million settlement after the death of his mother, Nancy, the resident with the gangrenous foot. She had spent eight months in 2019 at Brandywine Hall, a Genesis facility in West Chester that was later sold and renamed.
In a filing with the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Genesis admitted it was in arrears but asked the judge for more time, citing “unforeseen and exigent financial challenges.” Genesis said care for patients at its nursing homes would suffer if it had to pay immediately.
Unswayed, Judge Richard Haaz in June ordered Genesis to pay up, along with punitive interest. But the bankruptcy court stayed that order. Genesis still owes $1.4 million of the $2 million it was supposed to pay, according to Hunt’s claim. (The rest of the $3.5 million settlement is supposed to be paid by an insurer in January 2026.) Ian Norris, Hunt’s lawyer, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement.
Court records indicate Genesis lawyers never disclosed in either case that it was preparing to declare bankruptcy.

‘Bankruptcy as a tool’

In the first nine months of 2025, 10 other senior living companies with liabilities over $10 million entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Gibbins Advisors, a consulting firm.
Hamid Rafatjoo, a bankruptcy lawyer representing nursing homes who is not involved in the Genesis bankruptcy case, said filings may increase as the industry has become costlier to run and class action lawsuits have become a fixture.
“Nursing homes get sued all the time for everything,” Rafatjoo said. “A lot of operators wait too long to use bankruptcy as a tool.”
On Dec. 1, Genesis announced the results of its auction, saying it had elected to sell its assets to a private equity firm controlled by Landau. In a court filing, Anthony, the attorney for the personal injury claimants, alleged the auction was stacked in Landau’s favor despite an “objectively better and higher competing bid” from another private equity investor that would have provided more money to creditors. Genesis said in its statement that Landau’s group had increased its bid during the auction.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other senators last month asked the U.S. Trustee’s Office to intervene in the case, out of concern that “individuals who already own or control Genesis are trying to sell it to themselves, wiping away legal and other creditor debts in the process.” Lawyers representing those in charge of the auction did not respond to a request for comment.
Families of former Genesis residents said they fear the capacity to purge lawsuits through bankruptcy emboldens nursing home owners who provide deficient care.
“They can file bankruptcy again,” said Gabe Betancourt, whose wife, Nellie, died after her stay at Uptown Rehabilitation Center in Albuquerque. “And we’re the ones that will pay for it, with our memories, our lives.”
“It’s almost two years now,” Gabe Betancourt says of the death of his wife, Nellie. “When you sleep with somebody for 67 years and you stretch your arm, she’s there. There’s no way I will ever forget her.” (Adria Malcolm for KFF Health News)

A new report from Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota says 149 refugees resettled in the state during the 2025 fiscal year that ended in September, down from 391 in 2024. Nationally, refugee arrivals fell from 100,034 to 38,102.


Lutheran Social Services has overseen refugee resettlement in the state for the past 25 years and works alongside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Department of State. Rebecca Kiesow-Knudsen is the group’s president and CEO.
“We work with those federal partners to provide assistance to arrivals,” she said. “From the day the door to the plane opens, we are trying to work with that individual or that family to make sure that they are successful in their new community.”
Lutheran Social Services helps refugees find employment, housing and education. It also provides cultural education programming, English language training and legal services.
Refugees are people who flee their country to escape war, natural disaster, or persecution.
“Those refugee populations, if you look over the course of history, are always based on where the conflicts are in the international community,” Kiesow-Knudsen said. “It always shifts based on global conflict.”
The president decides how many refugees the nation accepts. President Joe Biden established the admissions cap for fiscal year 2025 at 125,000 refugees.
President Donald Trump set the lowest admissions cap in U.S. history for the current fiscal year at 7,500, and said those admission will be allocated primarily to white South Africans of European descent, who are known as Afrikaners.
That’s why Kiesow-Knudsen doesn’t expect to see many new refugee arrivals to the state any time soon.
“If there’s a case that is approved that has a connection to South Dakota, we might see an arrival,” she said.


Many of the new arrivals to South Dakota between October 2024 and September 2025 are Somalian or Congolese. Millions of people from countries in central and east Africa have been displaced due to conflict, violence and environmental disasters.
Those displacement factors are just one part of how different populations come to resettle in South Dakota. The resettlement program has historically been a family reunification effort. The first piece of information the federal government looks for is family ties, according to Kiesow-Knudsen.
“They’re always looking for ways that they can help people be the most successful in integrating into the country,” she said. “What we know is that people are more successful if they’re close in proximity to your family members.”

Americans woke up on Jan. 3, 2025, to blaring headlines: “US CAPTURES MADURO, TRUMP SAYS,” declared The New York Times, using all capital letters. The U.S. had mounted an overnight military raid in Venezuela that immediately raised questions of procedure and legality. Prime among them was what role Congress had – or should have had – in the operation.
Politics editor Naomi Schalit interviewed political scientist Sarah Burns, author of the book “The Politics of War Powers” and an expert at Rochester Institute of Technology on the historical struggle between Congress and U.S. presidents over who has the power to authorize military action.
Is this a war?
I wouldn’t call it a war. This is regime change, and whether or not it has a positive impact on the United States, whether or not it has a positive impact on Venezuela, I think the likelihood is very low for both of those things being true.
How does Congress see its role in terms of military action initiated by the United States?
Congress has been, in my view, incredibly supine. But that’s not just my word. Having said that, it is true that Congress – in the House, predominantly – tried to pass a war powers act recently, saying that President Donald Trump was not allowed to do any action against Venezuela, and that failed on very close votes.

So you see some effort on the part of Congress to assert itself in the realm of war. But it failed predominantly on party lines, with Democrats saying we really don’t want to go into Venezuela. We really don’t want to have this action. Republicans predominantly were supporting the president and whatever it happens to be that he would like to do. Moderate Republicans and Republicans who are in less safe districts were and are more likely to at least stand up a little bit to the president, but there’s a very small number of them.
So there may be an institutional role for Congress, a constitutional role, a role that has been confirmed by legal opinion, but politics takes over in Congress when it comes to asserting its power in this realm?
That’s a perfect way of putting it. They have a legal, constitutional, one might even say moral, responsibility to assert themselves as a branch, right? This is from Federalist 51 where James Madison says “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.” So it should be that as a branch, they assert themselves against the president and say, “We have a role here.”
In the 1940s, presidential scholar Edward Corwin said that in the realm of foreign policy, it is an invitation for Congress and the president to struggle. So it should be that Congress and the president are struggling against each other to assert, “I’m in charge.” “No, I’m in charge.” “No, I’m in charge,” in an effort to create a balance between the two branches and between the two things that each of the branches does well. What you want from Congress is slow deliberation and a variety of opinions. What you want from the president is energy and dispatch.
So certainly, if we have an attack like 9/11, you would want the president to be able to act quickly. And you know, conversely, in situations like the questions around what the U.S. is doing in Venezuela, you want slow deliberation because there is no emergency that requires energy and dispatch and speed. So the president shouldn’t be entirely in the driver’s seat here, and Congress should very much be trying very hard to restrain him.
What power does Congress have to restrain him?
They have to pass legislation. They aren’t particularly well suited right now to passing legislation, so effectively there is not a very clear way for them to restrain the president.
One of the things that members of Congress have attempted to do several times, with very little positive impact, is go to the courts and say, “Can you restrain the president?” And political scientist Jasmine Farrier has written that the courts have regularly said to members of Congress: “You have the power to stop the president, and you are ineffective at that. And so if you want to stop the president, you shouldn’t turn to us. You should work together to create legislation that would restrain the president.”
What would such legislation do? Cut off money for troops? Is it finger-wagging, or is it something really concrete?
There are a few different tiers. Joint resolutions are finger-wagging. They just say, “Bad, Mr. President, don’t do that.” But they have no effect in law.
The War Powers Resolution, first passed in 1973, is a legitimate way of trying to restrain the president. Congress intended to say to presidents, “You cannot start a war and continue a war without our authorization.” But what they said instead was “You could have a small war or a short war – of 60 to 90 days – without our authorization, and then you have to tell us about it.” That just sort of said to presidents the opposite of what they intended. So President Barack Obama took advantage of that with the military engagement in Libya, as well as Trump in his first administration.
This is not a partisan issue. It’s not Republican presidents who do it. It’s not Democratic presidents who do it. It’s every president since the War Powers Resolution was passed, and the only time that Congress has drawn down troops or drawn down money was the Vietnam War.
Other than that disastrous war, we have not seen Congress willing to put themselves on the politically negative side, which is taking money away from the troops. Because if you take away money right now, they’re going to be harmed.
What is the War Powers Resolution?
The War Powers Resolution from 1973, also known as the War Powers Act, was Congress – during the Vietnam War – saying definitively to President Richard Nixon, “You have overstepped your bounds.” They had explicitly said in law, you cannot go into Cambodia. And Nixon went into Cambodia.
So that was their way of trying to reassert themselves very aggressively; as I mentioned before, it didn’t work effectively. It worked insofar as presidents don’t unilaterally start wars that are large scale, the way that World War II was large scale. But they do have these smaller actions at varying levels.
Then we get to 9/11 and we see the 2001 authorization for the use of military force, and the 2002 authorization for the use of military force. The 2001 law authorized going after anyone in al-Qaida and associated with 9/11. The 2002 authorization was directly related to Iraq, saying “There is a problem with Iraq, we have to do something.” Both of them were extremely vague and broad, and that’s why we’ve seen four presidents, including Trump, using the 2001 and 2002 authorizations to carry out all sorts of operations that had very little to do with Saddam Hussein or al-Qaida.
In 2021, senators Mike Lee, Bernie Sanders and Chris Murphy collectively got together and tried to create a national security document that would restrain presidential unilateralism. It was a good effort on the part of members of Congress from a variety of different ideological views to attempt to restrain the president. It did not even sort-of pass – it barely got out on the floor.
Since that time, we haven’t seen a lot of efforts from members of Congress. They haven’t really reasserted themselves since the war in Korea, which began in 1950. It’s very clear that ambition is no longer checking ambition the way that it was meant to by the founders.
When you woke up this morning and saw the news, what was your first thought?
Here we go again. This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. Lots of presidents have made this error, which is that they think if you do this smaller-scale action, you are going to get a positive result for the nation, for the region, for international stability. And very rarely is that the case.

Delbert Hosemann, halfway through what may be their final terms, are not lame ducks yet, but they might need to prove their relevance.","Gov. Tate Reeves and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann may not be lame ducks, but perhaps they could be described as limping ducks going into the 2026 legislative session that begins Tuesday.
Reeves and Hosemann, two of Mississippi’s most prominent politicians, could be nearing the end of long political careers where they have exercised significant influence. Reeves is in his sixth four-year term in statewide office, while Hosemann is in his fifth.
The 2026 session starts the second half of what could be their final four-year term.
Hosemann, 78, presides over the Senate and generally wields substantial power in the Capitol. He has in the past said he is considering a campaign for governor in 2027. But it is hard to believe he will enter the race if billionaire businessman Tommy Duff runs, as he is signaling he will do.
Term limits will prohibit Reeves from running again for governor, though he is only 51.
Lame duck refers to a politician who loses some clout because his term in office is ending. Generally speaking, the closer that prominent politicians, such as governor or lieutenant governor, get to the end of a final term, the less clout they enjoy, especially in the legislative process where power is often the key to getting things done.
Granted, Reeves and Hosemann, who have both been mainstays in Mississippi politics for going on a generation, might not be lame ducks yet, but a slight limp might be detectable. They might need to prove their relevance.
House Speaker Jason White, the third person in the triumvirate that sets the legislative agenda, most likely does not face similar issues.
White is in his first term as speaker, and, regardless, the office of speaker of the Mississippi House is not term-limited.
The fact that White does not face a lame duck situation puts him in a stronger position on what most likely will be the primary issues of the 2026 session, such as whether to expand the opportunities to provide public funds to private schools.
White is a staunch supporter of providing public funds to private schools, as is Reeves for that matter.
Hosemann has been less enthusiastic, but at times he has appeared to try to compromise on key issues instead of taking strong positions in opposition to White and the governor.
The demand by White and Reeves to phase out the income tax is an example where Hosemann was not as enamored with the proposal. Still, it could be argued that during the 2025 session the lieutenant governor essentially capitulated to the wishes of the speaker and of the governor to phase out the income tax.
Many believe Hosemann has been willing to compromise to ensure on some issues, like tax cuts, he would not be harmed in a Republican primary should he run for governor. In general terms, it is believed there are more voters in the Republican primary who favor cutting taxes and providing public funds to private schools.
But perhaps the data is not certain on the issue of school choice. When vouchers have been on the ballot in other states, even conservative states, they have been rejected. At the same time in the 2024 election where Kentucky voters were awarding pro-voucher Donald Trump a higher percentage of the vote than he received in Mississippi, they rejected a voucher proposal.
So, maybe being against providing public funds to private schools would not hurt Hosemann in a Republican primary.
And if Hosemann is ending his political career, he could have nothing to lose by using his influence to block the school choice proposals in the Senate.
Of course, the key then would be for Hosemann to withstand the woes of being a lame duck or at least a limping duck and prove that he still walks strong.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/01134620/3X0A6396.jpg,,,2026-01-04 07:11:40.487766

“We're coming back to the basic hierarchy of needs here,” said Rep. Theresa Wood, who chairs the House Committee on Human Services.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Facing federal funding cuts and potentially faltering tax revenues ahead of this week’s legislative session, Vermont lawmakers say decisions over food and heating assistance programs serving their most vulnerable constituents will be particularly difficult.
“We’re coming back to the basic hierarchy of needs here,” said Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, who chairs the House Committee on Human Services.
Food aid is among her highest priorities, Wood said. But both 3SquaresVT, Vermont’s version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and the state’s charitable food system have been significantly impacted by federal cuts in recent months.
In 2025, 3SquaresVT incorporated a host of tightened restrictions following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July. Work requirements have been expanded, a number of categories of noncitizens have been excluded from the program, and new financial burdens have been placed on individual states. 
Vermont will be responsible for more than $8 million in new administrative costs, with millions more in possible penalties under a new accuracy enforcement system. Should the administration make errors according to the program’s rules just 1% more frequently than it did last year, the state could be required to contribute over $7 million to the cost of benefits next year.
Meanwhile, support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has dried up for local food providers, causing layoffs and reductions in service across the state.
“The federal government’s lack of human compassion is just beyond belief,” said Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, of the fallout from July’s federal funding law.
Lyons, who chairs the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare, agreed that nutrition assistance is an essential issue going into the session.
“We need to provide food — we need to ensure that SNAP continues,” she said.
The Vermont Foodbank has requested an allocation of $5 million from the Legislature to fund its farm-focused Vermonters Feeding Vermonters program and generally support its network of services.
“What we are seeing is this continued need for support beyond what philanthropy is able to do,” said Carrie Stahler, the Foodbank’s government and public affairs officer.
Stahler said 3SquaresVT has never been available to everyone in the state who needs help with food. But after thousands more Vermonters lost access to the program this fall or became subject to new requirements in order to be eligible, the nutrition assistance system is more important than ever.
Wood said she expects the Vermont Department for Children and Families, which administers 3SquaresVT, to include the program’s new state-level costs in its budget later this month. While she supports full funding for 3SquaresVT, the Foodbank’s request is one of a number of similar pleas to her committee.
“They’re not all going to be able to be met,” she said, adding that her committee is “going to be careful in doing our due diligence.”
Lyons expressed a desire to redirect or generate more funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, or LIHEAP, which President Donald Trump’s administration has indicated it wants to eliminate. The state’s Public Utility Commission recommended that the Legislature increase funding for heating assistance in an energy cost study last month to shore up the state’s crisis fuel service, and to prepare for potential federal cuts to the program.
The commission suggested raising the existing fuel tax slightly to partially cover the measure, which Lyons said she supports. But Wood urged caution on increasing funds for programs like LIHEAP, saying that this year, there likely won’t be room in the budget.
“We have many things to balance,” she said. “We have to be strategic.”
Housing, a major priority for Wood’s committee, continues to demand attention and funding. In addition to ongoing disagreement over the state’s motel program, Vermont’s housing authorities requested $18 million this fall to fund the state’s Section 8 voucher program after federal cuts left a number of organizations across the state facing shortfalls.
And health care, particularly in a moment where Vermonters face skyrocketing premiums and an increasing state cost burden, will be near the top of Wood’s agenda too.
Sen. Andrew Perchlik, D/P-Washington, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that last year’s buffer against federal cuts would potentially be a difficult model to replicate this year. One-time allocations in general, he said, could be in short supply, including to individual organizations like the Vermont Foodbank. 
Tax revenue slumps in recent months are a concern for lawmakers, Perchlik said. Though nothing is set in stone, he continued, it seems unlikely that the Legislature will have the same scale of tax surplus to use at its discretion, particularly in light of Gov. Phil Scott’s desire to buy down property taxes.
“It’s not clear we’ll have any of that money,” Perchlik said. “It’s definitely going to be more difficult.”

CORINTH — At the end of a long, wood-lined road in Corinth, Kathy Chapman’s studio stands nestled among the trees. The modest workspace — with panoramic views of the surrounding forest — serves as a quiet refuge from the outside world for the stained-glass artist.
Inside, a wood-fired stove keeps the workshop at a comfortable temperature even with snow outside. The studio’s walls are filled with art of different mediums, including a large array of stained glass projects. 
Chapman is a stained-glass artist and painter, originally from Brooklyn, New York. She grew up spending her summers at Lake Morey and then relocated to Vermont in 1984, after graduating from college. 
Chapman has always considered herself an artist, but she began working in stained glass restoration about 30 years ago. Along with restorations, she also makes acrylic paintings and custom stained-glass windows, available by commission. 
For Chapman, starting a new painting is the best part of the creative process. She described the feeling as “pure excitement.” 
“Something always happens,” she said. “Even if it’s terrible, you turn it around, put it upside down, and keep going until something speaks to you.”
Chapman prioritizes creativity over perfection, embracing a process that often leaves her paintings feeling deliberately “in progress.” This culminates in a corner of her studio she affectionately calls “painting heaven,” where unfinished paintings are lovingly stacked. 
“Sometimes you just get tired of something and want to move on,” she said. “Later, when I’m in a different headspace, I’ll pull one out, turn it around, and start again.” 
While painting gives Chapman a sense of creative freedom, stained glass forces her to slow down and really think about each piece. 
“Stained glass is a real process art,” she said. “You’ve got to make a map, you want to make sure everything is the best it can be before you assemble it.”

This contrast is evident in Chapman’s studio. 
On her worktable, pieces of a soon-to-be church window sit carefully arranged. For restorations, there is no space for “figuring it out.” Once a piece is cut and fired, it cannot be changed. 
Chapman didn’t originally set out to be a stained glass artist. About 30 years ago, a friend and local stained glass artist, Greg Gorman, needed help removing a large rose window from the upper level of a church for restoration. Chapman offered to help.
“It was a total restoration,” she said. “We took it apart piece by piece, and I just loved it.” 
At the time, there were very few people in the region doing large-scale stained glass restorations, a gap that fostered a strong working relationship between Gorman and Chapman. 
For about a decade, Chapman worked out of Gorman’s studio in Lyme, practicing and perfecting her craft. Gorman saw something special in her work. 
“I’m a big fan of hers,” he said. “Her stained glass and painting definitely feed each other. You can always tell it’s the same person.” 
In 2002, Chapman started working out of her own private studio, which greatly influenced her work. The solitude of her studio reshaped her creative process, allowing her to fully immerse herself in her art.
Chapman has lived happily in Vermont since her early 20s. The quiet, nature, and tranquility have all become essential parts of her practice. 
“I live a quiet life,” she says. “It’s easy to be alone out here. I have friends who rescue me from myself when I need it, but mostly I’m very happy being home.” 
Her quiet routines allow her the room to create art as she wishes. Her lifestyle and way of living are an intrinsic part of the art she creates. 
Although Chapman works in isolation, her restorations live in places that are the exact opposite. Chapman’s “bread and butter,” as she puts it, is doing restoration projects for local churches and common spaces, places that are key meeting points for the community. Churches in the area reach out to Chapman when their centuries-old windows need to be cleaned, repainted, and rebuilt. 
These projects are often long and slow. Chapman just finished her fourth year working on a project for the Waterbury United Church of Christ. By next spring, she will have completed the fifth and final window for the church, marking five years spent on the project. 
“For me, that feels like an accomplishment,” she said, “because then [the windows] are good for another hundred years.” 
Chapman’s quiet, solitary life is essential to her craft, but her friendships, she says, are just as important to her practice. 
Amy Peberdy, a fellow artist and longtime friend of Chapman, occasionally helps out in her studio. 
“There’s a real humanity in [Chapman’s art],” Peberdy said. “Mostly what her artwork is saying to the world is to just relax and try to get along.” 
This throughline isn’t always literal, but its tone is consistent through the quirky, slightly medieval, heavily painted art she creates. Chapman’s art is a reflection of the life she lives. A life filled with quiet beauty and art. 
“There’s a story in all of it,” said Chapman. “Even if people don’t see it, it’s there.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The fate of one lawmaker’s service in the Nebraska Legislature will likely be decided by yet-to-be-released evidence legislative leaders have said demonstrates a “pattern of behavior” warranting his expulsion.
The Legislature’s Executive Board, essentially its human resources department, unanimously recommended Dec. 13 that freshman State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst be expelled “in light of a demonstrated pattern of behavior … and not in response to a single isolated incident.” 
Discussion and a vote are expected early in the 2026 session, which begins Wednesday. The committee has not yet detailed the alleged “pattern.” McKeon, who denies wrongdoing, has made clear he has no intention of resigning.
A legislative staffer has accused McKeon of making “inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” according to a Nebraska State Patrol report that a spokesman relayed.

The Nebraska Examiner reached out to McKeon’s 48 legislative colleagues in December. Of them, 11 said they supported or leaned in favor of expelling McKeon. Another 14 said they were undecided, most because they wanted to see what evidence the Exec Board had access to first.
Seven senators declined to comment, and 11 more did not return calls or messages seeking comment. 
Part of the struggle, some senators said, is the novelty of an expulsion vote, a rare legislative process that left many lawmakers saying they need to understand how it works and the possible ramifications.










You’re not a statesman. That’s a boor. That’s a 13 year old in a locker room, and he can’t seem to get it through his head that you can’t behave like that.


– State Sen. Kathleen Kauth


Expulsion requires at least 33 votes under the Nebraska Constitution. If successful, it would be the first in state history. In that case, Nebraska would hold a special election in November for the final two years of McKeon’s term. 
McKeon represents central Nebraska’s Legislative District 41 — Boone, Buffalo, Greeley, Hall, Howard, Sherman, Valley and Wheeler Counties. 
McKeon has said he thinks he has the legislative votes to stay, “but time will tell.” He was elected in 2024 with 52% of the vote.
Workplace behavior
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha said she called McKeon the night the news of his criminal citation came in late October. She said she wanted to hear his side of what happened at an end-of-session party last May. She said McKeon’s story changed “within just a couple of minutes,” remarks Kauth described as a “lot of projecting, a lot of ‘I’m being a victim.’”
“Then I flat out asked him: Did you touch her?” Kauth recalled. “He said, ‘No.’ Five seconds later, he said, ‘Well, maybe I touched her shoulder.’ Five more seconds, he said, ‘Well, maybe I touched her back.’”
Immediately after, Kauth said, she told McKeon: “Dan, you need to resign.” 
Kauth is chair of the Legislature’s Business and Labor Committee, which oversees state labor laws, a committee on which McKeon sits.

State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, addressing McKeon’s situation broadly, said he’s seen “consistent and persistent behavior” in the Legislature and a workplace generally that is “incredibly problematic.” 
He said normalization of “abhorrent” sexual harassment and inappropriate jokes, including in the halls of the Nebraska State Capitol, is “gross and frustrating,” adding, “We all need to do better.”
“We as senators all need to do better to hold each other accountable, to hold folks accountable, when we hear those jokes, hear those things, because they’re not funny, and they are inappropriate,” Dungan said at a pre-session Lincoln-area event.
‘A statesman’
McKeon’s attorney, Perry Pirsch, has said the senator’s actions were not sexually charged and noted McKeon has apologized and taken ownership of what they called a “joke.” Pirsch and McKeon, a former wrestling coach, have described the touch as a “pat on the back,” which McKeon said was “like a coach would do.”
The lawmaker from Amherst said he got his “marching orders” from the Executive Board and did everything they required him to do, including moving his office and attending sensitivity training.
McKeon rolls out character defenders amid groping allegation, calls to resign

The legislative staffer’s attorney, Kathleen Neary, has noted that her client is preparing a civil lawsuit against the Amherst lawmaker. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, and multiple state senators have said McKeon should resign. 
McKeon initially tried to plead “no contest” to a misdemeanor disturbing the peace charge in Lancaster County, a plea to accept the punishment but not admit guilt. But shortly after the Exec Board recommended expulsion, he filed to plead not guilty and decided to fight.
McKeon “categorically rejects” the committee’s claim and last week described the push for his removal as a “political game.”
“I think we need a breath of fresh air in Lincoln … that’s what I was trying to bring to the table,” McKeon said Dec. 30 at a small news conference in Cairo, Nebraska. “Somebody that’s a statesman is in there, and they don’t like it.” 
‘Bare minimum standards’
State Sens. Carolyn Bosn and Jason Prokop, both of Lincoln, said at the same mid-December event as Dungan that it’s a privilege to serve in the Legislature and that lawmakers have duties and standards to uphold.

They said those responsibilities include respecting staff and the institution.
“When those bare minimum standards cannot be followed, I think it sets a precedent. I think it’s disrespectful to each other, to the institution, and I think that creates a real problem,” Bosn said.
Said Prokop: “The Nebraska Legislature is just an amazing representation of the people of Nebraska, and we have to do all we can to make sure that we are maintaining that strong reputation. I’m also supportive of removing those that don’t live up to that expectation.”
‘Altar of political expediency and correctness’
Pirsch, McKeon’s attorney, said in a Friday statement that any legislator who would vote to expel a colleague based on a “disputed factual narrative” and a charge of “only” disturbing the peace is “setting a dangerous precedent.”
“If a contested disturbing the peace [charge] is the new standard of conduct for legislators, all our representatives are at risk for wrongful expulsion,” Pirsch said.










I think we need a breath of fresh air in Lincoln … that’s what I was trying to bring to the table. Somebody that’s a statesman is in there, and they don’t like it.


– State Sen. Dan McKeon


NU Regent O’Connor resigning, effective Jan. 9, in wake of DUI allegation, possible impeachment

Pirsch said he can appreciate the Exec Board’s “desire” to advance the incident “for political purposes” but that McKeon’s district shouldn’t lose voice because of “a bad pun and a pat on the back.”
Pillen would appoint a successor for McKeon’s district through the end of the year if he resigns or is removed from office.
“I am confident there are enough senators of sufficient intellect not to sacrifice the legitimacy of the body on the altar of political expediency and correctness,” Pirsch said. “Senator McKeon looks forward to putting the distraction behind him and moving forward with the legitimate business of the State of Nebraska and the constituents of LD 41.”
‘You can’t behave like that’
Kauth and others say the allegation from a staffer is only part and not all of what concerns them. State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, for instance, said that had McKeon faced just a “he said, she said” allegation, he’d be more inclined to support a letter of reprimand or censure, short of expulsion. 
State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln. Jan. 28, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
But Holdcroft said his understanding is that more has happened, so he’s leaning in favor based on what he’s heard, but he hasn’t seen full details, so he said it’s “tough” to comment.
Kauth was the first to publicly describe a pattern of “inappropriate” comments by McKeon, including comments she said were “sexually laced,” “double entendres” or “totally off base.” She said she’s interrupted some of his comments in the past, including one she said McKeon made in Israel last fall in front of lawmakers from around the country.
There’s a line, Kauth said of the moment in Israel, yet McKeon “just leaped right over it.” She said some “jokes” might be funny in a locker room, “but we’re not in a locker room.”
Kauth said she could not recall the exact incident in Israel, saying his remarks occur “so frequently” it’s hard to remember each.
“His response is always, ‘I’m just joking,’” Kauth said. “You’re not a statesman. That’s a boor. That’s a 13 year old in a locker room, and he can’t seem to get it through his head that you can’t behave like that. Then you behave like that to a subordinate, to a staffer who is in the building, that is wholly inappropriate.”

McKeon, in a Dec. 17 statement, said he would try to watch future comments, “but I might still occasionally have a bad joke slip out, and those who are eggshells should avoid me, not engage me in conversation.”

Lawmakers could have faced a second historic vote in 2026: the possible impeachment and ouster of University of Nebraska Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha, a Democrat, who faces a felony charge for allegedly driving drunk in May 2025 and seriously injuring another. 
She announced her resignation after the Examiner had started asking lawmakers their thoughts on McKeon and O’Connor.
Kauth has said she was ready to begin impeachment proceedings, but O’Connor’s last day is Friday. Pillen will appoint O’Connor’s successor, and a special election will be held this year.
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil noted that McKeon faces a misdemeanor charge not “even remotely as serious” as the felony charge O’Connor faces. The Nebraska Constitution bars convicted felons from holding public office.
Murman said he would oppose expulsion if it were based on just the misdemeanor allegation. So, Murman said he needs to understand what evidence supports an alleged “pattern of behavior.”
Fear for the ‘political minority’
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, who declined to speak with the Examiner regarding O’Connor or McKeon, said at the Lincoln-area pre-session event that it would be “reckless” to prejudge a situation without a public hearing or a fuller understanding.

Now entering her 12th year as a lawmaker, Conrad said she fears legislative processes, including impeachment or expulsion, could be “weaponized” against a political minority. 
She said she doesn’t trust the “good judgment” of a majority of lawmakers.
“I think it’s incumbent upon all of us, if we believe in fair play, that we do extend a presumption of innocence and due process, even to the accused in very unsavory and untenable situations,” Conrad said Dec. 18. “Because otherwise, a political mob can run roughshod over the will of the voters and be weaponized against a political minority.”
McKeon has said expelling him would hurt the “will of the voters” who elected him.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said she wants the process to play out but “certainly would welcome him [McKeon] resigning.” 
She said the conversation distracts from other issues, including executive branch proposals and additional budget cuts that she said could hurt Nebraskans with developmental or intellectual disabilities.
“There’s a lot of bad people doing bad things to people,” Cavanaugh said at the time.

State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, a progressive who is the Legislature’s lone registered nonpartisan, offered a different take on what should happen in 2026.
Said Hunt: “I agree that we should go into the new year with a clean slate, and the best thing for the future of Nebraskans and for integrity of our institutions would be for everyone in the Legislature to resign, and the board of regents and the governor and the attorney general.”
Exec Board’s recommendation
Lawmakers said they expect the Executive Board’s details to come to light in the coming weeks as McKeon plans to fight. Many suggested it will get worse for McKeon if he doesn’t resign. McKeon, a former sports official, has suggested the opposite and said his colleagues don’t have all the facts.
State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Jana Hughes of Seward based their support or leaning support, respectively, partially on the Exec Board’s unanimous recommendation. Both noted that those representatives, appointed by their legislative peers, are privy to more information.
“I think he [McKeon] needs to step down,” said Hughes. “I’m hoping he will do that before we actually have to do an LR [legislative resolution] and have a hearing and then have a vote.”










I think it's incumbent upon all of us, if we believe in fair play, that we do extend a presumption of innocence and due process, even to the accused in very unsavory and untenable situations.

Of the nine voting members on the Exec Board, six said they would vote the same if and when expulsion comes to the floor, including Speaker of the Legislature John Arch, who sets the legislative calendar. One committee member could not be reached to confirm their position. 
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, Exec Board chair, said he advanced the recommendation because McKeon deserves “his day in legislative court.” He is one of two Exec Board members who said they would keep an open mind. Hansen says he wants to hear from the full Legislature first.
State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte added in a text: “Will need to see what the future brings, nothing certain. Keeping an open mind.”
‘We’re all very disappointed’
Kauth said lawmakers need to be role models, including in every action and speech.
“We should know better, especially [because] we’re the ones making the laws,” Kauth said. “If we choose not to follow those laws, that is absolutely inexcusable.”

State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a former member of the Exec Board and former chair of the Business and Labor Committee, said people “have to have faith in certain groups” and said he assumes his former committee did its diligent work, including with the advice of legal counsel. 
He said he still wants to hear all the facts.
“I think it goes without saying, we’re all very disappointed that this is something that we have to deal with. We shouldn’t have to deal with these things,” Riepe said. “It’s supposed to be a ladies’ and gentlemen’s club, and people need to behave and respond and act accordingly.”

Olympian Ben Ogden “just might be on the verge of taking American cross-country skiing where it hasn’t been before,” the New York Times recently reported. His hometown of Landgrove, population 177, knows how he got there.

University of Vermont graduate Ben Ogden — a two-time NCAA Nordic champion, 2022 Olympian and 2023’s fastest young male World Cup sprinter — “just might be on the verge of taking American cross-country skiing where it hasn’t been before,” the New York Times recently reported.
“He’s never really seen a race where he doesn’t want to burn from the beginning,” the Times wrote of Ogden’s “full-gas-from-the-start style” and “caution-to-the-wind fearlessness.”
But while the media is focusing on the skier’s future ahead of next month’s 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy, longtimers in the 25-year-old’s hometown of Landgrove, population 177, are pointing to his family’s pioneering past.
A century ago, the athlete’s great-grandfather, Samuel Robinson Ogden, was a young New Jersey visitor when he happened upon the Bennington County hamlet’s once desolate central village just before the 1929 stock market crash.
“The whole aspect was sad and dispiriting,” the man now called “Big Sam” went on to write in a memoir. “But I had some experience at fixing over old houses, and I could see possibilities.”

Buying 15 buildings for $4,500, Sam relocated his family to Landgrove and restored the properties. Upon his death a half-century later in 1985, the 88-year-old was remembered as a championing Town Meeting moderator, state House representative, author and columnist, supporter of the fledgling ski industry and a founder of such institutions as the Vermont Symphony Orchestra.
“The consequences of his work can be seen all over contemporary Vermont, though his significance lies as much on what he represented as what he did,” present-day historian Paul Searls has written. “He embodied the paradoxes and conundrums of a state struggling to reconcile the contradictory goals of embracing the modern world while trying to preserve what was best about Vermont tradition.”
Ben knows his great-grandfather through Searls’ book, “Repeopling Vermont: The Paradox of Development in the Twentieth Century.”
“On the one hand, I think it’s kind of cool,” the Olympian, taking a break for an interview, says of his ancestor’s tale of resuscitating a once ailing town.
On the other, Ben isn’t a newcomer like Sam. The self-described “native” views his environs with a different eye.
“I grew up seeing a lot of second homes, which was a confusing thing,” Ben says of a community where 60% of residences are part-time properties. “It’s sort of a waste that there are all these nice houses where Vermonters could live.”
And so the skier — striving, like the state, to push forward without careening off course — faces the same question his great-grandfather posed in a 1963 Vermont planning report: “How are we to get along in the modern world without sacrificing the values and assets we treasure most dearly?”
‘A bundle of contradictions’ 
Sam, born just after the first modern Olympics in 1896, grew up amid the dawn of the automobile and airplane, only to ship off during college to serve in World War I. Awarded France’s Croix de Guerre for heroism, he returned home at age 22 to his father’s insurance and real estate firm. But amid the progress and prosperity of the Roaring ’20s, he yearned for something simpler.
“I felt an intense revulsion for the life we had been living in the city,” Sam went on to write in one of more than half-dozen books he released between 1942 and 1978. “I scorned the rut that we all were in, the absence of real joy, the futility of boredom-inspired cocktail parties. I swore that we were but pawns in the uncreative game known as ‘keeping up with the Joneses.’”
That’s when Sam discovered Landgrove, founded in 1780 but at risk of disincorporation before he settled there in the spring of 1930. With few other residents other than his wife, Mamie, he became a jack of all trades: Blacksmith, selectboard member, justice of the peace, overseer of the poor and, in his most documented role, self-contrarian.

A proponent of preservation, Sam fought road plans for a Green Mountain Parkway in the 1930s and, after serving in World War II, pushed to prohibit billboards in the 1940s — two decades before the state adopted a 1968 ban.
“Country living seems to me to erect bulwarks against the mistakes and follies of the age,” the man who helped create the Vermont Natural Resources Council wrote in 1946.
Then again, Sam promoted tourism by helping found Vermont Life magazine and fostered the now billion-dollar ski industry by aiding in the installation of the first rope tow at the Bromley ski area in 1938 and the first chair lift at what’s now the Stowe Mountain Resort in 1940.
Sam acknowledged his dueling dualities.
“The winter season has become the liveliest season of all, and prosperity and increased tax revenues have made the lot of the remote towns and their citizens seem to be much more satisfactory,” he wrote in a 1967 newspaper column. “But there are times when doubts creep into my mind, and, mind you, this is the mind of one who has played some part in the development of winter sports in Vermont.”

Searls, a professor at Vermont State University, points out more paradoxes in his “Repeopling Vermont” book. It chronicles Sam’s connections with both the “most significant efforts to simultaneously preserve yet improve Vermont” and “essentially all of the state’s most important figures,” starting with governors from George Aiken in the 1930s to Philip Hoff in the 1960s.
“Ogden cherished small-town democracy, but he acted on a statewide scale to see decisions ever more determined by centralized bureaucracies,” Searls writes. “He wanted to protect the landscape built by state residents, but encouraged and enabled its change, much for the use of outsiders. He was enamored with the people he first found in Landgrove, yet shaped the town in a way that made it so those people were progressively scarce.”
That said, the historian extends Sam more credit than blame.
“There are no villains in this story, least of all Sam Ogden, who devoted himself to the good of the state and the town he loved,” Searls writes. “Anyone who was that much of a bundle of contradictions deserves association with a state defined by its ongoing struggle to find balance between contradictory impulses.”
That challenge, the historian says, is held in Vermont’s motto: Freedom and Unity.
‘Getting to the top’
Sam had children, one of them Samuel III, who had children, one of them John, who had children, one of them Ben.
Like his great-grandfather, Ben’s a paradox. Each winter he travels the world to blaze trails on skis. Come spring, summer and fall, he roots himself in his hometown, where he learned his sport from his father.
John Ogden, a Middlebury College racer, raised Ben and siblings Katharine and Charlotte as he coached a local youth league named after friend and fellow Vermonter Bill Koch, the first American man to win a Nordic Olympic medal.
John saw his son win a first-ever U.S. men’s youth medal (silver in the team relay) at the 2018 World Junior Ski Championships, a gold in the same event in 2019, a slot at the 2022 Olympics and, finally, the World Cup’s 2023 green bib award for fastest male Nordic skier under age 23.
John did so as he battled cancer for a decade before his death in 2023 at age 56.

“In lieu of flowers, John’s request was that everyone spend a little extra time outside, be it on foot, on a bike, or on skis, in his honor,” his family wrote in his obituary.
Plowing ahead amid adversity can be painful, but Ben has plenty of practice. A member of Stratton’s SMS T2 elite training team, he prepares physically and mentally to push forward no matter what.
“It can be really hard to keep your eye on the prize, so I think about the next section of the race instead of dwelling on the whole thing,” the skier says of overcoming midcourse obstacles. “If I’m on a big hill, I think about getting to the top. After that, I might get a bit of a break and can think about the next thing.”
Following his own advice, Ben returned to World Cup racing the winter after his father’s death and landed on the podium for the first time. He punctuated his third-place finish in the skate-sprint with a celebratory backflip.
‘My great discovery’
Ben’s ability to rise above runs back generations. After Sam’s wife of 51 years died suddenly on Christmas 1971, the family patriarch fell into depression and attempted to take his life.
“It was in the hospital that I made my great discovery,” Sam wrote in a subsequent New York Times column in 1973. “I discovered that all the values which my unbearable grief had twisted into a pattern of evil could be set aright once I looked at them through Mamie’s eyes; and this, by the grace of God, I managed to do. Now I resolved to live with as much joy as I could accomplish, doing the things that I knew she would want me to do.”
Sam lived a dozen more years before his death at Bennington’s Vermont Veterans’ Home in 1985.
“I hope,” he wrote in his last book in 1978, “that the denizens of Landgrove will hang on; nay, more than that, will, in fact, construct a community whose brightness will shed light on other places, a light which may be ever increasing, infectious and contagious, for if this world is to be saved, this is the sort of thing which will have to happen more and more frequently.”

Travel to Landgrove today and you won’t see many gathering spots along the main dirt road, save the 1874 Farmers and Mechanics Hall turned municipal office. But there you’ll learn the town consistently reports the highest voter turnout in the state (87.97% in 2024, topped only by Andover’s 88.65% and Ripton’s 88.36%).
Interest in Landgrove’s current favorite son is equally high, and not just because seemingly everyone is a descendant of Big Sam or knows Ben’s mother, Andrea, the town’s treasurer, assistant clerk and trustee of public funds.
Andrea is one of many with a sense of humor when talking about Ben. She’s happy, for example, to spur him to recount how he wore “wind briefs” underwear during his first major 50K race, only to learn how freezing cold and breathable fabric can lead to, in his words, “two hours of horrendous discomfort.”
U.S. and SMS T2 teammate Jessie Diggins, the most decorated American cross-country skier in history, adds that she offers support by gilding Ogden’s mustache (so signature, it’s part of his YouTube channel logo) with red and blue glitter.
When home, Ben unwinds by rebuilding a 1973 Land Rover he completely dismantled years ago. 
“It started as a little project,” he says, “that has really spiraled out of control.”
A 2022 UVM engineering graduate with master’s credits, Ben says his “pipe dream” is to someday work for a company like South Burlington’s Beta Technologies.
“Vermont is not a great place to start a corporation that gigantic,” he says, “but they’re just doing it because they believe in the state and the people and the culture, and that, to me, is incredibly inspiring.”
The feeling is hereditary. Back in 1967, Sam chronicled life in a book of poems titled “Vermont’s Year.” It opens with a verse about navigating January snow:
… Each advance that now I make
Is but a single pace,
The next unmade, unknown:
Each step my ultimate …
Three generations later, his great-grandson is forging on.

Leveraging a “housing crisis” to scrap environmental protection or other community values makes no sense at all.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Michael Long: Streamlining housing permits shouldn’t sideline the public.","Dear Editor,
The permitting and appeals process for housing and other development in Vermont should be streamlined. Legal challenges can be lengthy, expensive and onerous, and delay is often the central — and winning — strategy. But projects can be challenged, successfully or not, only by parties with substantial funding and sustained commitment. That reality leaves much of the public on the sidelines, even though public policy should serve the public interest first.
From that perspective, expediting disputes makes sense. What does not make sense is leveraging a “housing crisis” to discard environmental protections or other community values. For every worthy project ultimately derailed by appeals under the current system, there may be a deeply flawed project that proceeds unchallenged. Developers with the resources to raise millions and the sophistication to tap tax dollars or credits are rarely stymied by the permit process. More often, they benefit from a judicial and political environment that is more accommodating than it should be.
The Burlington Square Mall redevelopment illustrates the risk. When the project first surfaced, City Hall effectively transformed its planning department into an advocate and accessory for the developer, abandoning its role as a guide and regulator in the public interest. The result was a prolonged pit, lasting social and economic harm, and a development delayed far longer than necessary.
Reforming the regulatory system to facilitate housing development is a worthy goal. But sidelining the public — and the public interest — in the name of a housing crisis is not.

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Building a maximum-security, 3,000-bed prison was supposed to be a crowning achievement for Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders as she touts her bonafides as a law-and-order Republican.
Debate over the project is instead casting a shadow on this year’s primary elections and legislative session, with a special election this week in the Senate district where the project is planned.
That election kicks off what’s already expected to be a busy year for Arkansas politics and government, where Democrats hope to make inroads. It could also test just how deep President Donald Trump’s support reverberates in what’s been friendly territory for him.
Here’s a look at some of the biggest stories that will be shaping the year:
Franklin County prison blues
Sanders has shown no signs of backing down from the Franklin County prison site, citing the need to ease the backlog of state prisoners in local jails. But local leaders have said they were blindsided by the plans and that they don’t believe there’s infrastructure for such a facility.
Tuesday’s special legislative primaries could provide an early look at how much local backlash to the prison project could mobilize voters.
Five candidates are vying for the Republican nomination to fill the remaining term of the late Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who was an outspoken critic of the prison project. All five GOP hopefuls and an independent candidate running for the seat in March oppose Franklin County being the prison site.
At least two more opponents of the prison plan — Sens. Bryan King and Ron Caldwell — also will be fending off challenges in the March primary.
The elections lead into this year’s fiscal session, where another fight could be on the way over funding for moving forward with the prison’s construction. The big question is whether it will face another legislative roadblock.
Keeping it fiscal
The prison isn’t the only uncertainty about this year’s legislative session, which is intended to focus on budget issues.
Just a day after the March primary, lawmakers launch their pre-session budget hearings that could indicate how much of a strain Trump’s cuts may create.
It’s also unknown whether Sanders, who has called for eliminating the states’ income tax, will push for another cut or wait. 
Democrats’ bumpy inroads
This year’s election will be the latest bid by Democrats to prove they can make inroads in a firmly red state.
The party is trying to cut into Republicans’ supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature. The GOP right now can easily pass most appropriations bills without needing a single vote from Democrats.
But the party is also hoping to prove competitive in some of the top races, though it remains a longshot.
The top of the ticket is Hallie Shoffner, the farmer and Democrat who’s trying to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton. Shoffner faces an uphill battle against Cotton as she hammers him over the impact Trump’s tariffs have on farmers.
The Trump factor
The impact of Trump’s policy changes from his tariffs to the Medicaid cuts included in the “Big Beautiful Bill” will also come into starker terms.
That’s especially true with the premium hikes that took effect in the new year following lawmakers’ inability to extend Obamacare subsidies that would have lessened the burden.
Arkansas is a state that Trump won easily each time he ran for president, and the state’s GOP officials have shown little sign of distancing themselves from him. But 2026 could offer a new test on just how solid that support for Trump will remain.
Setting the stage for ’28, ’30
This year could provide some sign of whether Sanders and Cotton are laying the groundwork for 2028 even as they fend off challenges in the midterms. 
With regular appearances on Fox News and a State of the Union rebuttal under her belt, Sanders has been maintaining her national profile ever since taking office. Cotton remains a staunch ally of Trump who also kept his media appearances busy.
The future of three-term Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman could shake up Arkansas politics if he opts against seeking another term. 
But the year also provides some indication of what races remain on the minds of the state’s other top officials.

Sen. Doug McCrory, House Speaker Matt Ritter, Mayor Arunan Arulampalam and Hartford City Council President Shirley Surgeon were all in attendance, as was Sonserae Cicero, the director of a Hartford nonprofit who had just signed a $475,000 contract to help run the new economic development initiative. 
The Democratic leaders said the program, which was launched in partnership with another nonprofit called Upper Albany Main Street, would serve as a lifeline for small minority-owned businesses in Hartford’s north end by providing them with training and up to $15,000 in grant money. 
“These dollars will not only pave the path for new businesses to grow and thrive; it will ensure that our merchants have the support, technology and resources to stick around for years to come,” Surgeon, the council president, said. 
Fast forward a year, however, and everything has changed. 
Cicero’s contract with the city has been cancelled, the entire program is on hold and the roughly two dozen small businesses that signed up for training are left questioning whether they will receive any of the grant money that was promised. 
All of the hopes that state and local officials had for the program quickly fell apart in August after it became apparent that a federal grand jury was examining the relationship between Cicero and McCrory and investigating several of Cicero’s businesses, which operate under different versions of the name SHEBA.

The small businesses that signed up for the program, meanwhile, have become collateral damage in the ongoing criminal probe. 
Several entrepreneurs who completed the small business program this fall said they were still waiting to learn when they will receive their $15,000 grants.
Tahara Chapman, the owner of a company called High Maintenance, a boutique clothing and hair shop along Albany Avenue, said she did everything that was asked of her during the program. 
She attended courses led by Upper Albany Main Street about how to use Excel and Powerpoint. She created a business plan with SHEBA. And she ended the program by presenting that plan during a business “pitch” competition.  
But since then, Chapman said, she’s been left in the dark. 
“I don’t know what’s going on in the background, but I did what I was supposed to do,” she said. 
Merice Bryan, who is trying to start her own health care business called Best Practices Home Care, said she is in the same position — left to wonder when, or if, the grant money will materialize. 
“I worked very hard and spent a lot of hours going through the program, and I am counting on that money to build my business,” Bryan said. 
How the SHEBA contract fell apart 
How Cicero’s nonprofit ended up winning — and abruptly losing — the nearly half-million-dollar contract in Hartford is a complicated tale that stretches back more than three years.

Cicero did not respond to repeated emails, phone calls and text messages for this story. And McCrory has repeatedly declined to comment on the ongoing federal investigation. 
But the Connecticut Mirror retraced the decisions that led to Hartford awarding the lucrative contract to SHEBA by combing through thousands of records that were seized by the FBI, interviewing officials who appropriated the federal funds and talking with several of the business owners that were supposed to benefit from that money. 
The story that emerged from that reporting involves a defunct state agency, McCrory redirecting money behind the scenes, concerns about Cicero “double dipping” into public funds and a last-minute plan to finally provide aid to the small businesses in Hartford. 
But it all starts in 2022 in the state legislature, where lawmakers were busy divvying up hundreds of millions of dollars in federal pandemic relief money. 
A flood of federal money
That year, state legislators had the unenviable task of deciding how to split up Connecticut’s $20 billion state budget while spending an additional $1.7 billion in federal funds from the American Rescue Plan Act, which was passed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Gov. Ned Lamont and legislators from around the state submitted proposals for how to spend the additional money, and in May 2022, they passed a bill distributing the federal aid. 
Seventy million dollars was allocated to the governor’s workforce strategies. The state’s hospitality industry received $30 million. Another $10 million was budgeted for financial assistance to nursing homes. And a large number of smaller projects favored by state lawmakers were also bankrolled. 
Among those smaller allocations was $2 million for CT Next, a quasi-public agency that was created in 2015 to foster startup businesses in Connecticut. 
The bill didn’t specify how CT Next was supposed to use the money, but emails obtained by the CT Mirror show lawmakers, including Ritter, the House Speaker, earmarked the money for the Upper Albany Merchant’s Association, which operates under a nonprofit called Upper Albany Main Street. 
Ritter told the CT Mirror that the $2 million was meant to provide sorely needed financial assistance to small businesses in the predominantly Black community along Albany Avenue, which had struggled through the first two years of the pandemic. 
After the money was budgeted for CT Next, Ritter said, he was not involved in the discussions about how to structure the small business program. And, for a time, he heard very little about the $2 million that he helped to appropriate. 
That was until June 2023, when the speaker’s office began to receive complaints that the businesses along Albany Avenue had still not received the financial support that was promised.

Redirecting the funds
At that point, Marilyn Risi, who was the executive director of Upper Albany Main Street in 2023, contacted Ritter to inform him that her request for the federal money had been held up by state officials after more than a year of waiting.  
“The $2 million that you and Senator McCrory allocated for Upper Albany through CT Next was denied,” Marilyn Risi told Ritter in an email.  
“Could you let us know where that funding is and if it will become available?” she added. 
Risi’s email, which was forwarded to state officials by Ritter’s staff, set off a months-long conversation within several Connecticut agencies about what was prohibiting the state from releasing the money. 
Staff at the Department of Economic and Community Development, which was helping CT Next put together a plan for the federal funds, assured everyone that the money would be paid out as lawmakers intended. But in several other emails, DECD employees explained that there were a couple issues that were holding things up. 
The first problem was that CT Next initially planned to use the money to provide loans to the small businesses, which was considered a high-risk activity for the federal funds. 
And the other issue was that CT Next wanted to subgrant a large portion of the $2 million to other nonprofits, one of which was SHEBA. 
Records show that the leaders of CT Next’s board voted to award part of the $2 million to Cicero’s business shortly after the legislature appropriated the money in 2022, and by May 2023, CT Next’s executive director Onyeka Obiocha told state officials that McCrory authorized CT Next to allocate $350,000 of that money to SHEBA. 
“Senator McCrory is aware of and approved of the use of funds,” he wrote. 
Obiocha declined to comment for this story, and he referred any questions about CT Next’s intended use of the federal money to DECD. 
McCrory told the CT Mirror during a brief phone conversation in November that he had never heard of CT Next. 
But according to Risi, it was McCrory who introduced her to the staff at CT Next and proposed a partnership between SHEBA and Upper Albany Main Street. 
She said McCrory showed up at one of Upper Albany Main Street’s monthly meetings with Cicero to pitch the plan for the small business program. 
“Senator McCrory brought Sonserae Cicero to one of our meetings and stated we were going to be working with CT Next,” Risi told the CT Mirror in an interview. “We were supposed to contact small businesses that would be receiving loans and grants, provided that they would participate in seminars that (Cicero) was going to provide.”
Risi said she questioned, at the time, why Upper Albany Main Street needed to partner with Cicero on the small business training. And she pointed out that her organization already had an established relationship with the University of Hartford, which paired up college students with local businesses to help them with loan applications, creating business plans and budgeting.
But McCrory made it clear, Risi said, that Upper Albany Main Street would need to work with Cicero if they wanted to obtain the grant funding from the state.
Double-dipping?
The decision to subgrant part of the federal funds to SHEBA became a sticking point once state officials recognized that Cicero was already being paid $300,000 for the same type of work through another small business program, which McCrory also helped to approve. 
That state-run program, which was overseen by the staff at DECD through its Minority Business Initiative, required small businesses to go through SHEBA’s so-called “accelerator” program before they could apply for a forgivable loan of up to $50,000. 
The fact that Cicero would be paid to provide the same type of training through multiple taxpayer-funded programs, DECD officials explained, could lead people to question the state’s decision to award her more money. 
“They received state funding to perform the exact same work that was outlined in the CT Next proposal,” Rhonda Olisky, an employee at DECD, told other state officials in July 2023. “I believe Onyeka was unaware of that funding, however, he did agree with us that we all want to avoid any appearance of ‘double-dipping.’” 
Throughout the summer and into the fall of 2023, Ritter’s office continued to contact state officials to try to get answers about why the money for small businesses along Albany Avenue had yet to arrive.
But according to Ritter, nobody informed him or his staff about McCrory and Obiocha’s plans to shift hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding to SHEBA and another nonprofit.  
“Our office took the lead in getting this program set up, but in terms of any involvement in sub grant recipients, my office had no involvement in that, nor any knowledge of any of those conversations” Ritter said. 
In the end, none of the federal money ever made it through CT Next and out to the merchants along Albany Avenue. 
Jim Watson, DECD’s spokesperson, said that is because CT Next’s director and staff never finalized an application for the money.
In an email, Olinsky, who raised the concerns about double dipping, said she asked Obiocha to revise CT Next’s plan for the funds during a conversation in July 2023. But she said she never heard anything back from him.
State leaders officially shut down CT Next the following year and folded the quasi-public agency’s remaining operations into DECD.

A last-minute pitch
With CT Next gone and all of its employees laid off, Ritter said he and his staff had to find another way to get the federal money to the convenience stores, barber shops and other businesses along Albany Avenue. 
But as state legislators returned to Hartford in 2024, there was very little time left to formulate that new plan. 
The rules for the pandemic relief funding required the state to have contracts in place for all of the federal money by the end of 2024. Otherwise, it would be forced to return the unallocated funds to Washington, D.C. 
So as the time ticked down on another legislative session, Ritter said he and other lawmakers tapped the city of Hartford to come up with a way to spend roughly $1.7 million. 
The legislature officially allocated the federal funds to the city in May 2024. And Arulampalam, who had just taken over as Hartford’s mayor earlier that year, said he received a call from state officials shortly after that asking him to draft a proposal for how to distribute the money. 
Arulampalam, who was new to public office, said the opportunity to secure $1.7 million for one of the poorest areas of the city was too good of an opportunity to pass up. 
“We knew the money was going to go away. We didn’t know the history of the other attempts” to distribute the money, Arulampalm said. 
Arulampalam said it was Surgeon, Hartford’s council president, who ultimately brought forward a proposal for how to use the money. 
“We trusted Shirley and had reason to trust Shirley because she is part of that Upper Albany neighborhood. She knows that neighborhood and the businesses really well,” Arulampalam said. 
Hartford’s plan
As it turned out, Surgeon’s proposal closely mirrored the plan that was previously pitched by CT Next and approved by McCrory. 
Upper Albany Main Street would receive $475,000 from the city to teach small business owners how to use technology and computer programs. SHEBA would get another $475,000 for taking the businesses through an 8-week class that included training and one-on-one business coaching. And the rest of the money would fund the $15,000 grants for roughly 50 qualifying small businesses along Albany Avenue.  
Surgeon told the CT Mirror she did not speak to McCrory about how to allocate the $1.7 million that the legislature gave to the city and said she was unaware that Cicero had been in line to receive $350,000 when the money was earmarked for CT Next. 
Surgeon, who has appeared as a guest on Cicero’s podcast, said she encouraged the city to hire Cicero because her nonprofit was based on Albany Avenue and because she had prior experience providing small business training to minority-owned companies. 
The goal of the program, Surgeon said, was to make sure the small business along Albany Avenue could keep their doors open. 
“I live here,” Surgeon said. “I want to make sure the businesses survive.”

Arulampalam said the city ran its normal checks before the contract with SHEBA was finalized in October 2024, but he said state officials, who also reviewed the city’s proposal, never informed him of their earlier reservations about SHEBA being paid for similar services through multiple programs. 
Watson, DECD’s spokesman, said that is because state officials no longer had any concerns at that point about SHEBA being paid from multiple sources of taxpayer money. 
“Having done due diligence in vetting and attempting to contract the previous CTNext award, DECD staff was aware that the work proposed by the City of Hartford with the new ARPA allocation was not ‘double dipping,’ as it had a different scope and programmatic focus than the other SHEBA grant with DECD,” Watson said. 
Pausing the program
All of the vetting that was done in 2024 did not prevent the city from freezing the small business program earlier this year, however.
Arulampalam told the CT Mirror that his administration cut off the city’s contract with SHEBA in late August as a direct result of the grand jury investigation and several subpoenas, which ordered the state to turn over any records detailing a “personal or non-professional relationship” between McCrory and Cicero. 
By that point, 26 small business owners had already signed up for the digital literacy courses offered by Upper Albany Main Street. And six of those entrepreneurs had also gone through SHEBA’s portion of the training program in order to qualify for a $15,000 grant. 
Hartford officials said they chose not to cancel the city’s contract with Upper Albany Main Street. But that didn’t really matter. 
With SHEBA terminated, they said, the entire small business program had to be paused, while invoices and other records were sent to the state for review.  
DECD officials confirmed last month that they were analyzing that information, and they said the agency also requested additional documentation. 
According to Hartford officials, Cicero billed the city for roughly $72,000 before the program was officially halted. 
But DECD said all of those expenditures will need to be scrutinized before any of that money can be paid out. 
The same goes for the grants that the businesses along Albany Avenue have been waiting on for more than three years.

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)The deal to lure the Kansas City Chiefs across the state line to Kansas, announced by Gov. Laura Kelly with glee just a few days before Christmas, may represent the largest public subsidy in the history of American professional sports.
Is it a wise investment?
No, but it follows a recent Kansas trend of abandoning caution and reaching for shiny objects. Photos of Kelly clutching a Chiefs jersey were reminiscent of her plunking down $15 to place the first legalized sports bet in 2022. Sports betting came to Kansas following a lavishly obscene campaign by lobbyists to woo lawmakers, as documented by The New York Times. Kelly bet on the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl. They did, six months later, and Kelly donated her $165 winnings to charity.
She’d better hope that luck holds.
That Kansas has given its official blessing to sports and gambling – and has now committed billions of dollars of public debt to build a stadium where you can watch football while gambling on your phone – would have scandalized earlier generations of Sunflower State leaders. It should still scandalize us today, but we have become so inured to the soft sins that it feels like we are living in a Phillip K. Dick version of the reality we once knew.
Just as “The Man in the High Castle” is set in an alternate timeline where the Allies don’t win World War II, today’s Kansas is at once familiar and alien. Dorothy is still here, but she’s feeding slot machines at the local casino. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em have mortgaged the farm to build a stadium for the Wamego Munchkins. The Tin Man is assembling a nuclear reactor in his time off from the battery plant, and the Cowardly Lion is working for ICE. The Scarecrow? He burned up a long time ago in a grass fire out west. About the only vice still prohibited in this version of Kansas is marijuana, which will still get you thrown in the cooler if you’re caught by the Winkie Guards coming back from the Emerald City on I-70.
Okay, I’m sorry for not referring to the correct Wamego High School mascot. But I just couldn’t. They are the “Red Raiders.” While we’re on the subject, the Kansas City Chiefs will tell you that their name is an homage to former Kansas City, Missouri, mayor H. Roe Bartle, who was instrumental in bringing the team from Dallas in 1963. This is one of those “yes, but” explanations; Bartle did have the nickname “Chief,” but it wasn’t because of his municipal experience. Bartle had a long association with the Boy Scouts of America, in which he claimed to have been inducted into an Arapaho tribe and used the name, “Chief Lone Bear.” It should be noted that the Kansas City Chiefs now prohibit headdresses and face paint on game day and took instruction from a Native American working group on cultural sensitivity.
The Chiefs began as the Dallas Texans in 1959, owned by Lamar Hunt, and the team was a charter member of the American Football League. In 1966, the NFL and the AFL merged, and that year’s championship game between the two leagues was called the “Super Bowl” by Hunt.
Hunt’s brothers, Nelson and Herbert, tried to corner the world’s silver market in 1980. They failed and lost a billion dollars (about $4 billion in today’s money) in the process. But a consortium of U.S. banks bailed them out and, after various lawsuits and a Chapter 11 reorganization, the family fortune remained more or less intact. The Hunt family, whose net worth was valued at $25 billion by Forbes magazine, also owns one of Kansas City’s strangest features, SubTropolis, the world’s largest underground office complex carved out of the limestone bluffs north of the Missouri River.
Lamar Hunt died in 2006, aged 74. His son Clark was appointed chair of the Kansas City Chiefs.
It was Clark Hunt who appeared with Gov. Kelly on Dec. 22, announcing the Chiefs would move to a new stadium across the state line by 2031. Since 1972, the Chiefs’ home has been Arrowhead Stadium, part of the Truman Sports Complex. It includes Kaufmann Stadium, home of the Royals baseball team. The facilities are near the I-70 and 435 interchange in Kansas City, Missouri.
Although the location for the Kansas stadium has not been revealed, it’s expected to be near the Legends outlet mall in Kansas City, Kansas. That would place it just 23 miles from Arrowhead, perhaps the shortest relocation in NFL history.
Kansas had tried for years to poach the Chiefs from Missouri, and officials finally achieved the goal by offering to finance most of a $4 billion project for a new stadium, training complex, and team headquarters. Under the state’s STAR bond program, no public vote was needed, just the agreement of Kansas lawmakers and the billionaire Hunt family.
The deal blows up a 2019 border wars truce that prevented Missouri and Kansas from attempting to steal businesses from the other side of the state line in the Kansas City metro area. Kelly has denied breaking the truce, saying sports teams are different than corporations. The deal also follows a 2024 special election in which Jackson County, Missouri, voters soundly rejected a 3/8 cent sales tax to renovate stadiums for the Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals.
Kansas has used STAR bonds – for Sales Tax and Revenue – for a number of projects already, but none of the magnitude called for in the Chiefs agreement. The bonds allow state or local governments to develop projects to enhance Kansas tourism and economic development while paying off the project through sales tax revenue for the area served. In preparation for the Chiefs deal, Kansas lawmakers voted to remove the STAR bond prohibition on paying for more than 50% of a project and extended the repayment period from 20 years to 30. While there will be no referendum for state voters on whether the project is a good idea, local municipalities would have to vote to increase local sales taxes to help pay for the deal.
Past developments have ranged from the Kansas Speedway in Wyandotte County to the Flint Hills Discovery Center at Manhattan. Most projects have been successful, but two – an $83 million bond for the Schlitterbahn Water Park in Kansas City and $10 million bond for the Heartland Motorsports Park at Topeka – have failed. Both are now closed.
The deal offered the Chiefs is likely the largest public subsidy in the history of professional sports, according to reporting by the Kansas City Star. With debt service and facility maintenance, the deal may top $6 billion, with the state on the hook for 60% of that amount. The bond district could include much of Wyandotte and Johnson counties, including the city of Olathe, although boundaries and sales tax amounts have not yet been set.
Kelly, who said the Chiefs announcement was the biggest and most historic of her tenure, has defended the deal by saying it will bring more jobs and economic opportunity to Kansas and help define the state as receptive to business. She also claimed the deal would be paid for by revenue generated by the project, and not with “new taxes.” But it’s difficult to see how Kansas is anything but a chump in handing the Hunt family, which has more than enough money to build its own stadium, the keys to a $3 billion state-of-the-art domed facility in Wyandotte County and s $1 billion headquarters and a training camp in Johnson County. How does creating a massive sales tax district, encompassing much of the Kansas City, Kansas, metro area, amount to anything except new taxes?
At least Missourians got to vote on the sales tax.
Kansans had no such opportunity.
“The growth argument is nonsense because the economic impact from stadiums is mostly an illusion,” according to a recent Washington Post editorial. “When people are at the stadium, it’s a happening place with lots of activity. But there are only eight or nine NFL home games per year.” NFL stadiums spend most of the time empty, the Post noted, and they serve about as many customers in a year as a single American grocery store.
I couldn’t help but wince when I read the analogy to a grocery store. Holy Knute Rockne, no wonder Kansas showered the Hunt family with money. Our lawmakers are known for their fondness for any scheme including real or imagined grocery stores.
Seriously, the comparison to the Beneficient saga of a “pawn shop for the rich” in Hesston is a good one. In both cases, you had somebody who doesn’t need the money receiving concessions they don’t deserve for something hidden behind a curtain.
The Chiefs deal is further proof that Kansas government, on both sides of the lopsided aisle, serves the rich at the expense of everybody else. What kind of sales tax will be required to service the debt on a $4 billion stadium and accessories package? More than working families can bear. The cheapest seats at the beginning of the 2025 season were $160. Those living in the special district who could never afford to attend a Chiefs game must still buy staples and put gas in the car. Any sales tax increase will hit them harder than anyone else, because it is the most regressive of taxes. The argument that the bond district will generate enough revenue to pay for itself is disturbingly similar to some of the trickle-down rhetoric that came from Sam Brownback and company during his failed tax “experiment.”
Putting aside for a moment the question of whether it’s wise to give a $4 billion subsidy to a franchise owned by a single wealthy family, consider what else Kansas could fund with that kind of dough. My list would include libraries, art museums, history centers, concert halls, elementary schools, public parks, community health centers and homes for the unhoused.
Unrealistic?
Perhaps. But no more unrealistic than relocating a sports franchise 23 miles from its traditional location and expecting an economic miracle. Instead, what you get is economic sleight-of-hand where dollars spent on one side of an arbitrary line are now spent on the other. This might be good for a while, but once you’ve ignited an economic war you may lose something of greater value later. Think United Parcel Service or the Amazon Fulfillment Center, which combined employ more than 5,000. There are no signs that either is considering moving now, but with the truce broken and the state’s integrity shot, anything could happen.
There is also the issue that some longtime Chiefs fans are angry.
Rudi Keller, writing for the Missouri Independent, swears he will never root for the Chiefs again.
“The Kansas Chiefs are dead to me,” Keller declared.
Keller noted that after a spectacular run – and winning the Super Bowl in 2020, 2023, and 2024 – the team’s luck seems to have changed this year. They won’t even make it to the playoffs.
Some diehard Chiefs fans expressed concern over the move at a tailgater before the last home game of the season, according to KMBC television. In addition to losing the tradition of the Chiefs at Arrowhead, some questioned whether they would be able to afford tickets at a new venue.
The new Kansas stadium would seat 10,000 fewer fans than Arrowhead, according to the 33-page agreement, which might indicate more expensive seating. The Chiefs will also have the right to keep 100% of the proceeds, after paying a relatively paltry $7 million annually in rent to the state. It will also hold naming rights to the facility – and the ability to sell those rights to a third party. My guess is the Chiefs won’t take the high road and christen it the Eisenhower Sports Complex.
What Kansas gets from the deal are bragging rights – and most of the debt.
Despite the certainty with which Kelly announced the move, the deal is not yet final. Scattered throughout that 33-page document are conditions that have to be met before the move begins, including the acquisition by the Chiefs of the stadium site and NFL approval by Oct. 31.
Let’s all hope for a Halloween reprieve.

If you’ve ever wondered who’s actually in charge when your train is late, your ticket doesn’t scan, and parking enforcement is already writing you up, congratulations, you’ve stumbled upon the mysteries of Connecticut rail governance.



You may not realize it, but a single train ride on commuter rail in our state may be touched by seven or more different agencies, each responsible for a different part of your ride.
The railroad tracks: Fortunately, the State of Connecticut owns the railroad tracks, signals, power lines and right-of-way from Greenwich to New Haven, the largest section of the Northeast Corridor that is not owned by Amtrak.  That gives us more control of ‘our’ trains.  But Amtrak owns the tracks, etc. north of New Haven to Massachusetts (aka The Hartford Line) and east of New Haven (Shore Line East) to New London.
The stations: Here’s where it gets more confusing.  Most train stations in the state are owned by the Connecticut Department of Transportation but a few are owned by the towns and cities where they are located.  In some cases the town owns the station but it sits on CDOT-owned land. 
As for who is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the stations, it’s usually the owner, but CDOT contracts with third parties to run big stations like Stamford, New Haven, Hartford and Bridgeport.  Remember this when you’re slip-sliding on the platform waiting for your train.
Station parking: Parking at the stations is ultimately controlled by CDOT as they own most of the parking lots.  At the big stations with parking structures (Stamford and New Haven, for example) CDOT hires third parties to run the show.  In the smaller towns, where CDOT owns the land, they may lease it to the towns to operate.
The cost of parking is often determined by the local authorities, in most cases the towns or agents of CDOT.  On CDOT-owned land the parking is available to all, regardless of where you live.  In town-owned lots, rates and even access can be limited to local residents.
Commuter rail may be regional, but parking policy seems aggressively parochial.
The train cars: On the New Haven line, CDOT owns about half of the railcars with Metro-North (MTA) owning the rest.  On Shore Line East and The Hartford Line, CDOT owns the cars except those operated with Amtrak equipment.
Train operations: CDOT hires Metro-North to run the trains on the New Haven line and branches.  The two agencies work under an “operating agreement” the size of a Manhattan phone book and just as readable.  On Shore Line East the trains are run by Amtrak and on The Hartford Line some trains are run by Amtrak and others by a CDOT contractor, TransitAmerica.
Schedules: CDOT tells Metro-North the level of service they want and then works with that agency on how to deliver it (given financial constraints in their state budget).  On Shore Line East and The Hartford Line it’s a similar deal, but this time working with Amtrak.
The fares: CDOT sets commuter fares for trains in our state, not Metro-North or Amtrak.  The fares usually increase in lockstep: the latest MTA fare hike in New York soon to be matched by July’s CDOT fare increase.
How does all this work out for you, the rider?  How can a single train trip be touched by so many state and local agencies, towns and city departments?
The short answer is… it does work, sort of.  But it leaves passengers confused when it doesn’t.  If you get a parking ticket at the station, do you think Metro-North is to blame?  If your train is running late or over-crowded, who do you call?
Ours is an imperfect system, a relic of decades of bi-state compromises, overlapping authorities, and well-meaning bureaucrats and operators doing their best inside a structure that practically guarantees confusion.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0213_SR_CTRail_233-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-04 04:56:46.126991

When President Trump bombed and invaded Venezuela, kidnapped the Venezuelan president and installed a new government to “run” the country, all without the the consent of Congress and in violation of our Constitution, he crossed his own Rubicon.
The post Trump crosses the Rubicon. ‘The die is cast.’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Alea Iacta Est
Julius Caesar, fresh from his victories in Gaul, led his legion back into Roman territory contrary to the Roman law dictating that no commander could lead armed troops into Rome without the Senate’s approval. Caesar did it anyway.

Opinion

When Caesar’s horse stepped a forefoot into the Rubicon River, the northern border of Rome, one of his lieutenants is quoted by the historian Seutonius as saying, “Alea Iacta Est” — “The die is cast.”
Rome would never be the same again. The Roman Republic would erupt in civil war, and ultimately be replaced by the Roman Empire. Caesar would not live to see it. He was, instead, assassinated on the floor of the Senate for his hubris.
The long, slow decline of Rome would follow, and a cautionary tale against unchecked ambition would be chiseled in stone. The history of the Western world became neatly divided between before the Rubicon and after.
When President Trump bombed and invaded Venezuela, kidnapped the Venezuelan president and left Americans to “run” the country, all without the consent of Congress and in violation of our Constitution, he crossed his own Rubicon. The die has been cast, and nothing in America will ever be the same.
Make no mistake, President Maduro was a slimy bastard and Venezuela has been a screwed-up country for quite some time. But changing that situation was never the job of the United States, but rather that of the Venezuelan people.
I am reminded of Ed Abbey’s suggestion regarding uncontrolled immigration at our southern border. Abbey, the author of many left-leaning books on the environment, advised that every refugee from the southern hemisphere, who is escaping despotism in their own country, should be met at the border, given a machine gun and a week’s worth of food, and told to go back home and start their own goddam revolution.
Policing politics in other countries has never been the job of the United States, although we have seldom passed up a chance to do precisely that. Our misguided attempt to “run” South Viet Nam cost us nearly 60,000 American lives and almost tore our country apart. History repeats itself to our detriment.
What will be the eventual butcher’s bill in Venezuela?
Nobody is willing to count that cost, not even Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon who posted on X that the Venezuelan people “now have a chance to be free.” Everyone is too caught up in the machismo and patriotic fervor of the moment, waving flags and shouting “USA, USA.” After all, nothing says patriotism more than kicking the shit out of a third-rate country. Gordon’s recent expression of support and justification for Trump’s crossing of his own Rubicon made my skin crawl.
Every American soldier who bleeds if we get mired in Venezuela, will bleed directly onto Gordon’s hands, and on the hands of everyone who follows Trump across that fateful river.
And that is not to mention the damage done to the United States and our reputation as a beacon of hope in the world. We risk — if we are not already — being perceived as nothing more than a purveyor gunboat democracy.
What, too, of the damage to ourselves, as we cheer loudly for American imperialism instead of self-rule in the rest of the world, while we watch the sacred institutions of our Constitution sacrificed on the altar of poll numbers and deflection from the Epstein files?
Viewed in a certain light, the responsibility for the downfall of Rome should rest on the legion that followed him across the Rubicon. Had those troops simply said to themselves, “This is bullshit,” obeyed the law and stayed on their side of the river, Caesar would have bluffed and blustered and spouted off without anyone behind him to back him up. And the history of the world would be different.
That is the choice confronting us all. Do we follow Caesar, or do we obey the law? 
Perhaps the die is not yet cast.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The Charles County Democratic Central Committee chose Yonelle Moore Lee on Saturday to fill the vacant District 27A seat in the House, setting up a conflict with Prince George’s County Democrats who backed a different candidate Tuesday.
The conflict means that Gov. Wes Moore (D) will make the choice between Moore Lee and Darrell Odom Sr., the Prince George’s County nominee, to represent the district that straddles the two counties.
Moore Lee, 50, chair of the county’s school board, won the support of 12 of the 14 central committee members present at Saturday morning’s roughly two-hour meeting.
“Your trust in me really means a lot. I will not let you down,” Moore Lee, 50, said after the vote. “I’m not sure what the next steps may be and what will happen, but either way, I’m very, very proud.”
What happens next is Gov. Wes Moore (D) must make a decision.
The governor has 15 days to choose between Moore Lee and Darrell Odom Sr., once the names are forwarded to him, but the 2026 General Assembly is set to convene sooner than that, on Jan. 14.
The seat became vacant after Kevin Harris was sworn in last month as state senator for District 27, that includes portions of Charles, Calvert and Prince George’s counties. Harris replaced former Democratic Sen. Michael Jackson, who left to become superintendent of Maryland State Police.

Harris attended Saturday’s special public hearing in Charles County and spoke on behalf of Odom, 71, a member of the Prince George’s Democratic Central Committee who received one vote.
Lamont Tyler Bunyon, who runs an optometry practice in Prince George’s, also received a vote from the Charles County Democrats, as he did at the Prince George’s meeting.
As at Tuesday night’s meeting in Prince George’s, Harris was among a few elected officials to speak on behalf of a candidate Saturday.
Reuben Collins II, president of the Charles County Board of Commissioners, and Del. Debra Davis (D-Charles) both spoke on behalf of Moore Lee.
“As chairperson of the Board of Education, she leads one of the most complex public institutions in our region overseeing a $529 million budget and serving over 28,000 students,” Davis said. “She has proven her ability to lead in high-stakes environments, build consensus across diverse viewpoints and deliver outcomes that matter to families. That’s real governing experience.”
Each candidate was asked several questions that included their plans to support the central committee as a “valued” partner. They all agreed.
They differed slightly when asked what legislation or policy areas they would be most prepared to immediately work on.
Although each candidate mentioned education as a priority, Moore Lee specifically touched upon the multibillion-dollar Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
“We have made a promise and a commitment to a world class education with the Blueprint. It’s supposed to be fully implemented by 2030, that is something that’s very important to me,” she said.
Bunyon said a main priority for him would be health care, especially with his work as an optometrist. He noted how several friends died in their 50s.

“We have to do a better job arguing for better health care, advocacy [and] awareness resources, because it’s a lot of preventable things that can be done,” he said. “I hate to say that I’m going to run there and try to be a doctor to folks, but I’m supposed to because I’m trained to do it.”
Odom said public safety “is a strong suit” for him, with a specific focus on juvenile justice reform, domestic violence and emergency response and prevention. Besides his 31 years of service in the Army and Coast Guard, he also worked as an acting fire chief in Prince George’s.
The nearly two-hour meeting did have a little humor when Charles County committee Vice Chair Elaine Hardee asked Odom how he would define ethical leadership and model it as a delegate.
In a previous question, Odom summarized ethics in public service.
“Should I say ditto on that?” Odom said to several laughs in the room.
In the meantime, the Prince George’s Central Committee has scheduled another public hearing Monday to select someone a replacement for Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s). The former House majority whip, who has represented District 24 since 2017, announced more than two weeks ago he’s stepping down to work as the director of government relations at the University of Maryland, his alma mater.
Lewis’ last day will be the same day as the central committee meeting.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Members of the Kansas congressional delegation denounced Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as a dictator and urged President Donald Trump to explain to Congress use of U.S. airstrikes and deployment of troops to seize Maduro for prosecution in the United States.
Several in the federal delegation said it was important for Congress to fulfill its oversight role after Trump unilaterally ordered capture of a foreign leader in conjunction with a U.S. indictment for alleged drug and weapon trafficking. In the months before the assault Saturday, Trump had ordered sinking of small vessels in waters off Venezuela to interdict illegal drug trafficking and had directed the seizure of oil tankers.
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican, said he anticipated briefings on “future efforts in Venezuela” when the Senate returned next week to Washington, D.C.
“I commend the U.S. forces and intelligence community for a successful mission with the capture of Nicolas Maduro,” Moran said. “An illegitimate dictator and narcotrafficker, Maduro will face justice on American soil.”
The delegation’s lone Democrat, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, said Maduro was a “brutal dictator who has harmed the Venezuelan people.” She went further than her GOP peers in terms of demanding an accounting from the Trump administration.
“Launching overnight strikes without congressional authorization or a clear explanation puts U.S. troops in danger and risks further escalation. The American people deserve answers,” she said.
U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt, a Republican serving the 2nd District of eastern Kansas, said execution of the arrest warrant for Maduro, and his spouse, was a military and law enforcement achievement.
He said he expected a detailed briefing on the operation “in the coming days” and concluded “Congress must carefully monitor the path forward and always put America First.”
“There is no doubt Maduro’s regime supported the drug trade poisoning Americans in our communities, welcomed American adversaries from around the world into our hemisphere and contributed to the deadly chaos at our southern border in recent years,” Schmidt said. “Bringing him to justice will make our Kansas communities safer. As with any great change, much hard work and uncertainty now lies ahead.”
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican, said Trump promised to secure the U.S. borders and cut off “threats to us and our families at the source.” He also said “Venezuela ignored the call to stop trafficking lethal drugs into America.”
“Our communities and children are safer at home because of bold leadership like this, and I’m proud to stand with him,” Marshall said.
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican representing the Wichita region, said the United States was a “safer country” following military action to “protect the American people from the rampant and deadly narcoterrorism enabled by and carried out by the illegitimate Maduro dictatorship.” He said he looked forward to justice prevailing in U.S. courts.
Colin McRoberts, a Democratic candidate for the 1st District seat held by GOP U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, said he believed the United States’ strike on Venezuela involved “acts of war against a sovereign nation.” Mann didn’t respond to a request for comment.
McRoberts said it was hypocrisy for Trump to embrace an indictment of Maduro on weapons and drug charges after pardoning a former Honduran president for comparable offenses.
On Dec. 1, Trump pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez. He was convicted in March 2024 on drug trafficking and weapons charges and was serving a 45-year prison term.
“A jury convicted Hernandez of those charges. Donald Trump pardoned him. This attack on Venezuela was not about drugs,” McRoberts said. “We know that Congress has the constitutional authority and duty to get to the bottom of this — to demand and require real answers from the administration, instead of propaganda and lies.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jerry-Moran-ku-med-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-03 18:57:42.849565

Nearly a hundred people came together in downtown Raleigh Saturday to voice their opposition to the Trump administration’s removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and apparent subsequent takeover of the South American country. 
The “emergency protest,” organized by Code Pink, the Party for Socialism and Liberation and several Democratic groups, took place in Moore Square Saturday afternoon. 
In an hour-long news conference earlier Saturday, President Donald Trump called Maduro a “narcoterrorist” and said Maduro and his wife would be tried on criminal charges in the U.S. justice system.
Trump said, “we’re gonna run the country” of Venezuela until a “judicious” transfer of power can be orchestrated. Trump also said U.S. oil companies would go into Venezuela to rebuild the country’s petroleum infrastructure, tap the nation’s vast oil reserves and sell the oil to other countries.  
North Carolina Republicans took to social media and the airwaves to praise the president’s actions as a victory for law and order. 
“President Trump’s bold actions have kept his promise to stop drug traffickers and save American lives,” said N.C. GOP spokesman Matt Mercer. “Capturing narcoterrorist Nicolas Maduro protects Americans and makes the world a safer place.” 
But protesters Saturday afternoon said they think the U.S. takeover of Venezuela will destabilize governments throughout the region, and most said they think Venezuela’s oil was the primary aim of Trump’s action. 
“Venezuela has one of the largest oil reserves in the entire world,” Alex Trejo with the Party for Socialism and Liberation told NC Newsline. “The real aim of the U.S. intervening in Venezuela is for the oil and not for this ‘democratic process’ that they’re trying to disguise it as.” 
Karen Still protests in Raleigh, Jan. 3, 2026. (Photo by Laura Leslie/NC Newsline)
Trejo conceded that Maduro was not democratically elected, but said it violated international law for the U.S. to go in and remove him. “It’s the Venezuelan people’s right to go through that democratic process themselves,” he said.  
Nikolai Kutsch with the N.C. State College Democrats said Trump’s actions contradict his 2024 campaign promises to avoid involving the U.S. in wars in other countries. 
“We don’t go in and run another country, and certainly not without congressional approval. This is completely outside of his bounds of power,” Kutsch said. “It is a lie, and it is not going to end well, I think.” 
Karen Still, a U.S. military veteran, held a sign likening Trump’s action in Venezuela to Russia’s attempt to take over Ukraine.
“What he is doing in Venezuela is equal to what Putin is doing. It’s aggression,” Still said. “There’s no good reason for it, and he’s putting America’s security and American lives and service members in jeopardy.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4128-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-03 17:57:27.206193

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Supporters of two citizen initiatives, one focused on parental rights and another on barring transgender athletes from girls’ sports, moved closer Friday to getting those measures before the Washington state Legislature, and potentially voters.
The political committee Let’s Go Washington turned in signatures in support of the initiatives on Friday at the secretary of state’s office in Tumwater.
Let’s Go Washington said supporters collected 416,201 signatures on petitions for IL26-001. This initiative would repeal changes that legislators made this year to an earlier Let’s Go Washington initiative that codified rights for parents of public school children.
The other initiative, IL26-638, seeks to block transgender girls from competing in girls’ sports. Backers gathered 445,187 signatures for that measure, Let’s Go Washington said.
Initiative sponsors were advised to turn in at least 386,000 signatures. Friday was the deadline for gathering the signatures.
Both measures are initiatives to the Legislature, meaning they would go before lawmakers for consideration in the session that begins Jan. 12. The secretary of state’s office will now verify the submitted signatures to confirm the initiatives can move forward.
“This is not a partisan issue, this is a common sense issue,” said Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager who leads Let’s Go Washington. He said that about half of those who’d signed the initiative petitions were independents or Democrats. “This has broad support.”
Critics of the latest Let’s Go Washington initiatives say they pose safety risks for vulnerable students, including LGBTQ+ students and those seeking mental health support at school.
“Let’s Go Washington is playing political games with the lives of vulnerable trans and queer kids,” said Sophia Lee, a board member with the Gender Justice League.
“While most parents are loving and supportive, the reality is not all kids are safe at home, and need to turn to a trusted teacher or school counselor for help,” Lee added.
Lee’s statement was issued by WA Families for Freedom, a group opposed to the initiatives that has support from Service Employees International Union 775, the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and the Washington Education Association, which is the state’s largest union representing public school employees.
Lawmakers have three paths they can take if the submitted signatures are verified.
They can approve the initiatives, making them law. They can reject the initiatives, sending them to the ballot for voters to decide in November’s election. Or they could pass an alternative to the proposed initiatives, and both versions would go to the ballot.
Also on Friday, Washington state Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, canceled an appointment that he’d made to turn in signatures for an initiative to the Legislature that called for proof of citizenship to be required for voter registration in Washington state.
Walsh said he planned to refile the measure as an initiative to the people and would attempt to get it qualified for the November ballot.
The secretary of state’s office said Friday it would likely take three to four weeks to review the signatures for the Let’s Go Washington initiatives. In the meantime, the office will provide the Legislature with a “provisional certification” to make lawmakers aware of the initiatives.
Assuming that the signatures in support of the initiatives are verified, it will mark the third consecutive year that the Legislature will grapple with issues surrounding parental rights, transgender students and diversity, equity and inclusion in schools.
IL26-001, the initiative focused on parental rights, would roll back changes to state law made during the 2025 legislative session by House Bill 1296.
That bill made revisions to Initiative 2081, the so-called parents’ bill of rights, which lawmakers approved in 2024. Initiative 2081, backed by Let’s Go Washington, established certain rights for the parents of public school students under age 18.
Among the changes in House Bill 1296 was to remove a guarantee for parents to be able to access student medical records. Republicans criticized the Democratic-backed rewrite of Initiative 2081 as undermining the initiative.
Rep. Monica Stonier, the lead sponsor of House Bill 1296, said her understanding is that IL26-001 would not affect key aspects of the law, such as guaranteeing students a school environment free of discrimination, harassment and bullying.
She said it was still too early to say how Democrats, who hold majorities in the House and Senate, might handle the initiative if it does end up before the Legislature.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/unnamed-2-scaled-e1728001712821-1024x597.jpg,,,2026-01-03 15:56:32.924395

“To be clear, Maduro is a despot who stole elections, imprisoned his political opponents, and trampled on the rights and dignity of his people. But the Trump administration cannot unilaterally impose regime change and push the United States to the brink of war. This action endangers our citizens and democracy around the world,” Ross said in a statement.
Ross also criticized the administration for failing to consult with Congress ahead of the military action.

“Using military force to remove a foreign head of state unquestionably requires congressional authorization. Trump ignored that requirement, once again thumbing his nose at our Constitution and Congress. At a minimum, Congress must be fully and transparently briefed and then take appropriate action,” Ross said.
Budd said the actions were within the president’s authority, and praised those responsible for Maduro’s capture.
“God bless our Special Operations Forces who carried out this daring mission, the Air Force, all those with our armed forces & intelligence community who provided support,” said Budd, who serves on the Senate Armed Services committee.
During Saturday’s press briefing, Trump said that the United States will run Venezuela during the transition, and he did not rule out the involvement of American troops.
“We’re not afraid of boots on the ground.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, whose district includes Fort Bragg, praised the arrest of Maduro.
“Accountability finally came. Parents in our community can rest easier knowing a major peddler of fentanyl is off the streets. I’m grateful for the heroes who carried out this mission and praying for their safe return home,” said Hudson on social media. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis (NC-01) praised the operation, but also expressed a desire for more information about what comes in the weeks ahead.
“Protecting American families and ending narcotics trafficking are essential to our national security,” said Davis, a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. “The use of military force demands accountability and transparency, and Congress must be kept fully informed to ensure proper oversight. I expect continued briefings as the situation in Venezuela evolves.”
Protests were planned for downtown Raleigh and other cities on Saturday afternoon.
Mickey Brigham, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, called the military action a war for oil.
“Venezuela has the largest reserves of oil in the world, and the U.S. government is using military aggression to try to steal that wealth,” Brigham said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2251091316-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-03 15:56:32.924395

Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro and his wife were captured and flown out of the country after months of stepped-up pressure by Washington. President Donald Trump insisted the U.S. government would run the country at least temporarily and was already doing so.
“If we’re starting another endless war, with no clear national security strategy or need, count me out,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement. “Maduro is a cruel criminal dictator, but President Trump has never sought approval from Congress for war as the Constitution requires — and our military deserves. … The American people deserve — and Congress should demand — facts and clarity.”
U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, also condemned the action.
“Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, but I have seen no evidence that his presidency poses a threat that would justify military action without Congressional authorization, nor have I heard a strategy for the day after and how we will prevent Venezuela from descending into chaos,” said Himes, ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in a statement. “The administration must immediately brief Congress on its plan.”
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, also raised questions about the legality of the move.
“President Trump’s claim that today’s unauthorized, unilateral military strike in Venezuela is a ‘law enforcement’ action against indicted drug trafficker Maduro rings hollow after the president just pardoned a convicted drug dealer, the former president of Honduras, who was serving a 45-year sentence in U.S. prison, 34 days ago,” Courtney said.
On the social media platform X, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., questioned Trump’s motives.
“He is starting an illegal war with Venezuela that Americans didn’t ask for,” he wrote. “This is about satisfying Trump’s vanity, making good on the long standing neocon grudge against Maduro, enriching Trump’s oil industry backers, and distracting voters from Epstein and rising costs.”

President Trump thinks he is above the law. He steals from taxpayers. He thumbs his nose at the law.And now, he is starting an illegal war with Venezuela that Americans didn’t ask for and has nothing to do with our security.  How does going to war in South America help…— Chris Murphy  (@ChrisMurphyCT) January 3, 2026

State Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said the move was “unpopular and illegal.”
“President Trump never laid out the need or the plan to the American people or Congress before attacking a sovereign nation and putting the lives of the men and women of our military at risk,” Duff said in a statement. “This is an unpopular and illegal attack motivated by the vanity of a president focused on TV ratings instead of exploding prices here at home.”
Trump brushed off criticism from U.S. Democratic lawmakers that he did not seek permission from Congress ahead of time and that the strike was illegal. He called his Democratic critics “weak, stupid people” and blamed his political opponents for inflation in the U.S.
He said the operation in Venezuela was “really genius.”
“All they do is complain,” he said of the Democrats.
“They should say, ‘Great job.’ They shouldn’t say, ‘Oh Gee, maybe it’s not constitutional.’ You know, the same old stuff that we’ve been hearing for years and years and years,” Trump said.
The stunning, lightning-fast American military action, which plucked a nation’s sitting leader from office, echoed the U.S. invasion of Panama that led to the surrender and seizure of its leader, Manuel Antonio Noriega, in 1990 — exactly 36 years ago Saturday.
The United Nations said it was “deeply alarmed” by the U.S. strikes and reported detention of Maduro. It expressed concern that the escalation was a violation of international law.
“These developments constitute a dangerous precedent,” Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said in a statement. Dujarric said the U.N. worried about the larger implications for Latin America and the Caribbean and called on “all actors in Venezuela” to respect human rights and the rule of law.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26003525929670-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-03 13:57:05.923743

The six-year redshirt senior quarterback threw for 303 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 50 yards and two scores to take MVP honors, Koredell Bartley scored on a 100-yard kickoff return and Wake Forest beat Mississippi State 43-29 in the Duke’s Mayo Bowl on Friday night.
Ashford, who arrived at Wake Forest this season eager for a chance to start, threw TD passes of 14 yards to Kamrean Johnson, 64 yards to Jack Foley and 62 yards to Ty Clark III and had scoring runs of 2 and 1 yards for the Demon Deacons (9-4).
Wake Forest finished the season winning seven of its final nine games, this one sending coach Jake Dickert to a celebratory mayonnaise bath.
“When I got to Wake Forest, I was in a rough spot mentally and physically,” said Ashford, who transferred from South Carolina after also spending time at Oregon and Auburn. “I was kind of down on myself, almost at a point where I didn’t know if I wanted to keep playing. Man, these guys just instilled just so much in me, and, just helped me in so many ways and instilled that confidence back in me.”
The end result was a nine-victory season for Dickert, the most wins by a first-year coach in Wake Forest history.
The victory also meant having 42 1/2 pounds of mayonnaise dumped over his head. But he had some support, as his three children joined him in the celebration and got doused as well.
“I couldn’t get my wife to do it. She was like, ‘Absolutely not!’” laughed Dickert. “But to share that with my kids is something that is going to be a special memory for us for the rest of our lives.”
Clark finished with 153 yards from scrimmage after taking over the starting role after second-team All-ACC selection Demond Claiborne opted out of the game after declaring for the NFL draft.

Freshman quarterback Kamario Taylor, making his second college start, had a big second half for Mississippi State (5-8) and finished 13 of 22 for 241 yards and a touchdown. He ran for 60 yards and another score before suffering what appeared to be a significant leg injury with 1:46 left in the game. He was carted off the field.
Mississippi State coach Jeff Lebby wouldn’t go into detail after the game about the extent of Taylor’s injury, but sounded relieved, saying: “I feel good about the initial reports.”
After the Bulldogs took an 3-0 lead on the game’s first possession, Bartley fielded the ensuing kickoff at the goal line and weaved his way up the field before turning up the speed and outracing five defenders to the end zone for the longest touchdown in bowl history.
Ashford, a sixth-year QB playing for his fourth college, put Wake Forest ahead 30-12 in the third quarter on a 2-yard run to make it a three-possession game and the Demon Deacons seemed in cruise control.
But the Bulldogs came storming back.
Mississippi State finally found the end zone on the last play of the third quarter when Taylor took a shotgun snap, got a running start and leaped over the line and extended the ball over the goal line on his descent.
He added a 2-point conversion toss to cut it to 10 and then found Sanfrisco Magee over the middle for a 42-yard catch-and-run touchdown pass to make it 30-27 with 10:17 left.
Wake Forest appeared to put it away when Ashford ran for his second touchdown with 4:07 remaining, but Navaeh Sanders blocked the extra point and Kelly Jones scooped it up and scored for 2 points for the Bulldogs to make it 36-29.

On the ensuing possession, Mississippi couldn’t manage a first down and Lebby made the curious decision to punt on fourth-and-11 from the Bulldogs 25 with 2:35 left in the game, putting trust in his defense that it would force a three and out and get the offense the ball back.
That backfired, as Ashford dumped a pass off to Clark on a third-and-7 and he raced 62 yards untouched to the end zone to seal the win.
Taylor’s mother, LaQuandra Conner, took to Facebook after the game posting a picture of her and her son, saying “thanks everyone for the prayers it was his ankle but NOTHING is torn or broken GOD had MY BABY covered and for that I say THANK YOU LORD.”
Taylor was making his second career start for the Bulldogs (5-8) after a promising initial appearance in a loss to No. 6 Ole Miss.
He finished 13 of 22 for 241 yards and a touchdown against Wake Forest. He also ran for 63 yards and another score in when he took a shotgun snap, ran forward and dove over a pile of players and extended the ball over the goal line.
“A ton of toughness and there’s a ton of things to be excited about,” Lebby said about Taylor. “… For what he was able to get out of this bowl experience with 15 extra practices, the ability to go play in another game against a really good opponent, to me that is huge for us as we’re continuing to build this thing.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/03103308/AP26003209908711.jpg,,,2026-01-03 11:56:44.721857

(Photo by Westend61/Getty Images)Communication with loved ones, neighbors and mental health professionals can be a key piece of addressing the stressors and mental health issues that affect farmers at higher rates than other professions. 
According to the National Rural Health Association, suicide rates are “significantly higher” in rural areas than in urban areas and farmers die by suicide at a rate 3.5 times higher than the general population.
Mental health hotlines for farmers have seen more calls this year. In addition to the normally stressful profession, farmers have another year of unstable trade, less than desirable markets, high input costs and the phrase “farm crisis” on the tip of many people’s tongues.

Amber Wright, a therapist with Integrated Telehealth Partners, said there are certain signs that a farmer, or anyone, might be in a poor mental health state. Wright said communication, on the part of the person struggling and from their support network, are important factors in addressing some of the issues. 
Wright, who meets with patients via telehealth at UnityPoint Health’s Behavioral Health Clinic in Grinnell, said irritability, increased substance or alcohol consumption, and sleeplessness are signs that someone might be having more than just a bad day. 
“That could be another symptom of something else major,” Wright said.

FarmAid hotline:

According to FarmAid, which operates a hotline for farmers in need of assistance, farmers have unique stressors that affect their mental health: farming relies on factors outside of a farmer’s control, they often work alone for long hours at a time, there is a lot of pressure to hold onto their land and they usually have a self-reliant attitude that makes it difficult to ask for help. 
Rural areas where farmers live are also more likely to be mental health care deserts, which adds to the difficulty of finding help. 
Wright said meeting the “daily requirements” for living – adequate food, fluids and sleep – can help alleviate some of the stress that can lead to a more serious mental health issue. She also recommended farmers make time for a hobby or activity, like walking the dog, going for a drive, or grabbing coffee with a friend. 
“Trying to find those skills that are going to help you decrease that stress and also kind of help bring your morale back up too,” Wright said. 
Telehealth counseling and online resources can be another option for rural households. Iowa State University, Iowa Farm Bureau and Iowa Corn Growers Association have lists of mental health resources for farmers. 
Other organizations, like Farm Rescue, offer operational support, like haying or feeding livestock, to farm families in distress.
ISU has the Iowa Concern hotline and a partnership with Farm Foundation to offer free counseling and other resources. The university also has a list of stress management resources, like financial planning, legal counseling and disaster assistance. 
Wright said resources like this can be helpful to manage stress. Even writing out expenses and trying to come up with a financial plan can make it a little less stressful the next time a piece of equipment breaks down. 
“Always communicate, write out things, write them down, talk to people … ask for help,” she said.

Southern Turnings, founded by Scott and Jane Ann Maddox, has become a staple for residents and a tourist destination for visitors. 
The business now hosts community events, weekly classes and has expanded to additional locations, playing a significant role in efforts to bring activity back to Pine Avenue.
Starting with a single lathe 
When Southern Turnings opened more than eight years ago, Scott Maddox said downtown Wiggins had “one other struggling business.”  
“When I moved here (in 1997), this was a vibrant community,” he said. “All the buildings were open, there were shops, there were things to do. It was wonderful. Over time, that kind of dissipated, and basically there was nothing here.” 
Originally, the space was intended to be Maddox’s studio — just an air-conditioned space to turn wood. The idea to add a coffee shop and retail area came from Jane Ann Maddox. Still, the first few years showed little promise.

Maddox remembers asking his wife to buy a soda just to log a transaction for the day.
“I just thought we’d lost our minds. I mean, there was just no business,” he said.  
They stuck with it through the COVID-19 pandemic, and eventually, the tide turned. 
“Pretty soon we were sitting here going, ‘This is crazy!’” Maddox said. “I give credit to our community for making that (growth) happen, because obviously, if they wouldn’t come through that door, we wouldn’t be growing.” 
He said there’s no secret to success — much of the credit goes to their employees and patrons. 
“I don’t think I’ve done anything different than anybody else could have done, but I am told that people hope we never leave,” he said. 
Teaching the next generation

As Southern Turning continues to grow, it offers new opportunities to connect with the community — including weekly hands-on woodworking classes.  
Maddox first learned about woodturning — using a lathe to shape wood into symmetrical items like bowls and cups — during a trip to Silver Dollar City in Stone County, Missouri. He was fascinated by the craft, watching a young ex-Marine with PTSD turn wood for three hours.  
A retired high school teacher, Maddox said he envisioned his studio as an extension of the classroom. Over the years, he has taught students who have gone on to sell their pieces to help pay for college. Today, his students range from age 11 to 92. 
While Maddox may be  one of the only practicing woodturners in the area, he’s part of a broader community that stretches across Mississippi and into Memphis.
“There’s something about making something,” he said. “I would hope that kids would get more involved because that’s something that will last forever, but once people like me pass away and are no longer turning, it’s a craft that’s going away.” 
A vision for what comes next

Southern Turnings’ success has grown alongside renewed efforts to revitalize downtown. Maddox said local business owners formed the Pine Avenue Business Association, which now hosts events on the first Saturday of each month to bring more people to the area.
That momentum has inspired the Maddoxes to expand. Two and a half years ago, they opened a drive-thru coffee hut, which has thrived like the original location. A third location — a coffee shop at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College — is expected to open Jan. 5. 
The Maddoxes have also begun thinking about the future. With retirement on the horizon, they’ve considered eventually selling the business — but for now, they say they’re focused on staying connected to the community.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/29092413/Wood-Turning_Image_Studio.jpg,,,2026-01-03 09:12:17.047576
,DC,2026-01-03 13:14:01+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump says US 'will run’ Venezuela during transition after capture of President Maduro,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-says-us-will-run-venezuela-during-transition-after-capture-president-maduro,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Saturday that the United States will “run the country” of Venezuela until “a proper transition can take place,” following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a strike against the South American nation, a stunning move conducted without congressional notice or approval.Trump in a press conference from his Florida estate made it clear how much the secret Friday military operation related to securing oil, and he detailed how petroleum companies would finance the rebuilding of Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. Trump as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio also signaled other countries, such as Cuba, could face the same interventionist fate as Venezuela. “If I lived in Havana and worked for the government I'd be concerned,” Rubio said, referring to the communist nation’s capital. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who was also captured, will be brought to New York to face a U.S. indictment on narco-terrorism and conspiracy charges originally levied in 2020. The Venezuelan’s reelection to the presidency in 2024 was determined by many countries, including the U.S., to be illegitimate, and he has been characterized by the administration as the leader of a drug cartel.“This extremely successful operation should serve as (a) warning to anyone who would threaten American sovereignty or endanger American lives,” Trump said. “What happened to Maduro could happen to them.”The early morning military strike quickly drew strong rebukes from Democratic lawmakers, who said the action superseded Congress’ authority to declare war. It’s also caused deep concern among world leaders, some of whom pushed for an emergency United Nations meeting.However, Republicans in Congress stood by the president’s decision, saying it was justified.No timeline for US involvementTrump did not give a timeline for how long the unusual U.S. intervention in Venezuela might go on, but said the next year would look different for the nation. “We are going to run the country until such time that we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said. He added that the U.S. would make Venezuela safe for “the great people of Venezuela, and that includes many from Venezuela that are now living in the United States and want to go back to their country.” Since taking office, the Trump administration has tried to end temporary and humanitarian legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants. Trump during the press conference repeated accusations that Maduro has sent Venezuelan immigrants with ties to the Tren de Aragua gang to the U.S.Friday’s military action campaign, named “Absolute Resolve,” came after Trump waged a months-long pressure campaign to oust the authoritarian leader. Dozens of boat strikes have been carried out in the Caribbean that the president and members of his administration have justified, without showing evidence, by saying the boats were carrying drugs to the U.S.“The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,” Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, early Saturday. “This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement.”Before the Saturday press event at Mar-a-Lago started, the president posted a picture to social media of Maduro handcuffed, blindfolded and aboard the U.S.S. Iwo Jima Navy ship.‘We’re not afraid of boots on the ground’Trump at the press conference was joined by Rubio; Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth; Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine; CIA Director John Ratcliffe; and senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, who is a lead architect of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Trump said that an “overwhelming American military power” was used to capture Maduro and his wife in the “dead of night” from “air, land and sea.”He added that no U.S. military members were killed in the operation, but did not rule out a continued presence for American troops in Venezuelan territory. “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” Trump said.Trump said those officials standing behind him at his press conference, “for a period of time,” would “be running” Venezuela. The president offered few details on what that U.S. intervention would look like, but called it a “partnership.” It’s unclear if there are any American officials or troops stationed yet in or near Venezuela. CubaTrump also lodged a thinly veiled threat against the Cuban government.“Cuba is not doing really well right now,” Trump said. “I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about.”He added that the U.S. also wants to help Cubans who have been “forced out of their country,” so they can return to the island nation. The Trump administration has also moved to end humanitarian protections for more than 110,000 Cubans. Rubio, whose parents were part of the first wave of Cuban exiles before the Fidel Castro regime took over Cuba, agreed, and criticized Cuba’s government as being run by ""incompetent, senile men.”It’s unclear how the next in line to the presidency for Venezuela, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, will fare. Trump said that Rubio had a conversation with Rodríguez, and said “she’s essentially willing to do what is necessary to make Venezuela great again.”María Corina Machado, the leader of Venezuela's opposition party, and recent Nobel Peace Prize winner for her work to advance democracy in her home country, called for national unity and said that “the hour for freedom has arrived.” “We have struggled for years, we have given it our all, and it has been worth it. What had to happen is happening,” she said in a statement.Indictment in Southern District of New YorkMaduro and his wife will face a trial in the U.S. They have been indicted in the Southern District of New York, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media. The DOJ also indicted their son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, along with several other Venezuelan politicians, and the alleged leader of the Tren de Aragua Venezuelan gang, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores.President Maduro is charged with “Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States,” Bondi said. In 2020, the first Trump administration lodged the same four counts of narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine, possession of machine guns and conspiracy to possess machine guns. The new indictment includes Maduro’s wife, son and the alleged leader of the Tren de Aragua gang. Andy Kim: Officials ‘blatantly lied’ to CongressThe news drew ire from Congress, which has the authority to declare war. New Jersey Democratic Sen. Andy Kim said for weeks Trump officials briefed Congress that the boat strikes were not “about regime change.”“I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” Kim wrote on social media. “Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said the capture of Maduro meant the Venezuelan president would be held accountable. “President Trump’s decisive action to disrupt the unacceptable status quo and apprehend Maduro, through the execution of a valid Department of Justice warrant, is an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States,” Thune said.He added that when senators return to Congress Monday, he looks forward to additional security briefings from Trump officials.House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, made similar remarks and called the attack “justified.” He said he’s working with the Trump administration to schedule briefings with House lawmakers when they return to Washington.  The top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, wrote on social media that without “authorization from Congress, and with the vast majority of Americans opposed to military action, Trump just launched an unjustified, illegal strike on Venezuela.” Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who is also co-chair of the Congressional Venezuela Democracy Caucus, said in a statement that the “capture of the brutal, illegitimate ruler of Venezuela … is welcome news for my friends and neighbors who fled his violent, lawless, and disastrous rule.”However, she called for the opportunity for Venezuelans to partake in democracy, such as being able to swear in the presidential candidate who won Venezuela's election in the summer of 2024.President-elect Edmundo Gonzalez was forced into exile and fled to Spain under asylum. Voter results showed that Gonzalez won by a large margin, but Venezuelan government officials, without providing proof, determined that Maduro won. Mike Lee speaks to RubioUtah’s GOP Sen. Mike Lee initially questioned “what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.”But Lee later changed course after speaking with Rubio.“He informed me that Nicolás Maduro has been arrested by U.S. personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant,” Lee said of Rubio.Rubio has long stated that Venezuela’s president is not legitimate, nor is his government. Rubio accused him of being the head of a drug cartel.  “He is not the legitimate president of Venezuela,” Rubio said during Saturday’s press conference. “He is a fugitive of American justice.”Rubio, who while in Congress was a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also defended a lack of notification to lawmakers.“This is not the kind of mission you can do congressional notification,” Rubio said. For months, Democrats and a handful of Republican lawmakers have tried to curb the president’s strikes in the Caribbean, which have killed about 115, but Congress failed to pass several War Powers Resolutions.The War Powers Resolution of 1973 is a tool for Congress to check the power of the executive branch by limiting the president's ability to initiate or escalate military actions abroad.  Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who has pushed for the Senate to vote on the War Powers Resolution, said he will again advocate a vote to curb Trump’s military actions in Venezuela. Venezuelans in the USAs the U.S. conducts military land strikes on Venezuela, more than half a million Venezuelan immigrants are legally fighting the Trump administration's move to end Temporary Protected Status. TPS is granted when a nation's home country is deemed too dangerous to return to, due to violence, such as war, or a major natural disaster.More than 600,000 Venezuelans have TPS, which was initially granted in 2021, just one day before the first Trump administration finished its term. Temporary protections were granted to Venezuelans due to Maduro’s regime. Trump has also tried to apply the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to any Venezuelan national, aged 14 and older, who is a suspected gang member, for the purpose of removing them from the U.S. without due process. Trump and Maduro also clashed after several deportation planes carrying Venezuelan immigrants landed in El Salvador, where more than 200 men were detained at a brutal mega-prison known as CECOT.Maduro called the move a “kidnapping,” and several months later the Venezuelans were returned to their home country in a prisoner exchange. World leaders call for UN to conveneIt’s unclear what the consequences of the Trump administration’s move to capture a foreign leader will have on international relations, but many world leaders disavowed the attacks and called for an emergency United Nations General Assembly meeting. The U.N., which is five miles away from the New York court where Maduro will stand trial, did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.Mexico’s President, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, condemned the attacks and said they violated Article 2 of the United Nations Charter. “Based on its foreign policy principles and its pacifist vocation, Mexico makes an urgent call to respect international law, as well as the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, and to cease any act of aggression against the Venezuelan government and people,” she said in a statement.Sheinbaum Pardo called on the United Nations to “act immediately to contribute to the de-escalation of tensions, facilitate dialogue and create conditions that allow a peaceful, sustainable solution in accordance with international law.”Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also criticized the attack in Caracas, Venezuela. “The justifications put forward for these actions have no factual basis. Ideological hostility has prevailed over pragmatic, businesslike approaches and over efforts to build relationships based on trust and predictability,” according to Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said on social media that the U.S. moves to capture Maduro and bomb Venezuela “cross an unacceptable line.”“Attacking countries, in flagrant violation of international law, is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability, where the law of the strongest prevails over multilateralism,” he wrote. The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, called for de-escalation and said that international law “and the principles of the United Nations Charter must be respected.”",,,,2026-01-03 14:12:01.022736

From beginning to end, 2025 was a year of devastation for scientists in the United States.
January saw the abrupt suspension of key operations across the National Institutes of Health, not only disrupting clinical trials and other in-progress studies but stalling grant reviews and other activities necessary to conduct research. Around the same time, the Trump administration issued executive orders declaring there are only two sexes and ending DEI programs. The Trump administration also removed public data and analysis tools related to health disparties, climate change and environmental justice, among other databases.
February and March saw a steep undercutting of federal support for the infrastructure crucial to conducting research as well as the withholding of federal funding from several universities.
And over the course of the following months, billions of dollars of grants supporting research projects across disciplines, institutions and states were terminated. These include funding already spent on in-progress studies that have been forced to end before completion. Federal agencies, including NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Agency for International Development have been downsized or dismantled altogether.
The Conversation asked researchers from a range of fields to share how the Trump administration’s science funding cuts have affected them. All describe the significant losses they and their communities have experienced. But many also voice their determination to continue doing work they believe is crucial to a healthier, safer and more fair society.

 Pipeline of new scientists cut off

Carrie McDonough, Associate Professor of Chemistry, Carnegie Mellon University
People are exposed to thousands of synthetic chemicals every day, but the health risks those chemicals pose are poorly understood. I was a co-investigator on a US$1.5 million grant from the EPA to develop machine-learning techniques for rapid chemical safety assessment. My lab was two months into our project when it was terminated in May because it no longer aligned with agency priorities, despite the administration’s Make America Healthy Again report specifically highlighting using AI to rapidly assess childhood chemical exposures as a focus area.
Labs like mine are usually pipelines for early-career scientists to enter federal research labs, but the uncertain future of federal research agencies has disrupted this process. I’m seeing recent graduates lose federal jobs, and countless opportunities disappear. Students who would have been the next generation of scientists helping to shape environmental regulations to protect Americans have had their careers altered forever.
I’ve been splitting my time between research, teaching and advocating for academic freedom and the economic importance of science funding because I care deeply about the scientific and academic excellence of this country and its effects on the world. I owe it to my students and the next generation to make sure people know what’s at stake.

 Fewer people trained to treat addiction

Cara Poland, Associate Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University
I run a program that has trained 20,000 health care practitioners across the U.S. on how to effectively and compassionately treat addiction in their communities. Most doctors aren’t trained to treat addiction, leaving patients without lifesaving care and leading to preventable deaths.
This work is personal: My brother died from substance use disorder. Behind every statistic is a family like mine, hoping for care that could save their loved one’s life.
With our federal funding cut by 60%, my team and I are unable to continue developing our addiction medicine curriculum and enrolling medical schools and clinicians into our program.
Meanwhile, addiction-related deaths continue to rise as the U.S. health system loses its capacity to deliver effective treatment. These setbacks ripple through hospitals and communities, perpetuating treatment gaps and deepening the addiction crisis.

 Communities left to brave extreme weather alone

Brian G. Henning, Professor of Philosophy and Environmental Studies and Sciences, Gonzaga University
In 2021, a heat dome settled over the Northwest, shattering temperature records and claiming lives. Since that devastating summer, my team and I have been working with the City of Spokane to prepare for the climate challenges ahead.
We and the city were awarded a $19.9 million grant from the EPA to support projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build capacity to address environmental and climate justice challenges.
As our work was about to begin, the Trump administration rescinded our funding in May. As a result, the five public facilities that were set to serve as hubs for community members to gather during extreme weather will be less equipped to handle power failures. Around 300 low-income households will miss out on efficient HVAC system updates. And our local economy will lose the jobs and investments these projects would have generated.
Despite this setback, the work will continue. My team and I care about our neighbors, and we remain focused on helping our community become more resilient to extreme heat and wildfires. This includes pursuing new funding to support this work. It will be smaller, slower and with fewer resources than planned, but we are not deterred.

 LGBTQ+ people made invisible

Nathaniel M. Tran, Assistant Professor of Health Policy and Administration, University of Illinois Chicago
This year nearly broke me as a scientist.
Shortly after coming into office, the Trump administration began targeting research projects focusing on LGBTQ+ health for early termination. I felt demoralized after receiving termination letters from the NIH for my own project examining access to preventive services and home-based care among LGBTQ+ older adults. The disruption of publicly funded research projects wastes millions of dollars from existing contracts.
Then, news broke that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer process or make publicly available the LGBTQ+ demographic data that public health researchers like me rely on.
But instead of becoming demoralized, I grew emboldened: I will not be erased, and I will not let the LGBTQ+ community be erased. These setbacks renewed my commitment to advancing the public’s health, guided by rigorous science, collaboration and equity.

 Pediatric brain cancer research squelched

Rachael Sirianni, Professor of Neurological Surgery, UMass Chan Medical School
My lab designs new cancer treatments. We are one of only a few groups in the nation focused on treating pediatric cancer that has spread across the brain and spinal cord. This research is being crushed by the broad, destabilizing impacts of federal cuts to the NIH.
Compared to last year, I am working with around 25% of our funding and less than 50% of our staff. We cannot finish our studies, publish results or pursue new ideas. We have lost technology in development. Students and colleagues are leaving as training opportunities and hope for the future of science dries up.
I’m faced with impossible questions about what to do next. Do I use my dwindling research funds to maintain personnel who took years to train? Keep equipment running? Bet it all on one final, risky study? There are simply no good choices remaining.

 Inequality in science festers

Stephanie Nawyn, Associate Professor of Sociology, Michigan State University
Many people have asked me how the termination of my National Science Foundation grant to improve work cultures in university departments has affected me, but I believe that is the wrong question. Certainly it has meant the loss of publications, summer funding for faculty and graduate students, and opportunities to make working conditions at my and my colleagues’ institutions more equitable and inclusive.
But the greatest effects will come from the widespread terminations across science as a whole, including the elimination of NSF programs dedicated to improving gender equity in science and technology. These terminations are part of a broader dismantling of science and higher education that will have cascading negative effects lasting decades.
Infrastructure for knowledge production that took years to build cannot be rebuilt overnight.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)There was nothing under the tree this Christmas for South Dakota’s schools, state employees and health care providers.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden proposed no funding increase for them in the next state budget.
“Because our revenues haven’t grown much, we have to keep them flat this year,” Rhoden said during his annual December budget address.
Hearing that news so close to the holidays, I was reminded of the climactic movie scene in “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation,” when a wife takes her husband to task for eliminating his company’s Christmas bonuses.
“You didn’t!” she exclaims. “Well, of all the cheap, lousy ways to save a buck!”
Governor proposes ‘limited budget’ for SD that avoids big cuts but keeps school funding flat

Rhoden’s plan looks even cheaper and lousier in light of the revenue our state government has surrendered, the money it’s wasted, and the questions that have arisen about its spending on economic development.
Three years ago, lawmakers and then-Gov. Kristi Noem decided to reduce the state sales tax rate from 4.5% to 4.2% until 2027. It was an ill-considered attempt to distract homeowners from their property tax complaints by giving them a sales tax holiday they didn’t ask for, and it cost the state more than $100 million in annual revenue. Most consumers, meanwhile, aren’t noticing the penny they’re saving every time they spend $3.33.
Noem’s administration also squandered $20 million developing a prison site that ultimately had to be abandoned.
That fiasco began four years ago. The state was flush with cash from federal COVID-19 relief and stimulus funding, so Noem and legislators started stuffing money into a prison construction account. They wanted to replace the oldest parts of the Sioux Falls penitentiary, which dates to 1881.
Noem’s Department of Corrections selected a site in rural Lincoln County, and a lawsuit quickly arose from landowners who hadn’t been told that a prison might pop up in their neighborhood.
Years of contention boiled over last winter after Noem bolted to run the federal Department of Homeland Security. An insurgent group of legislators led a revolt against the Lincoln County location, and Rhoden — who was elevated from lieutenant governor upon Noem’s departure — surrendered to reality. He pushed the reset button and appointed a task force that selected a different site in Sioux Falls.
By that time, the state had already spent an unrecoverable $20 million on the abandoned land, for myriad expenses including design work, sewer pipes, herbicide application and geothermal test wells.
More recently, questions have arisen about the combined $69 million of grants, loans and tax rebates that the administrations of Noem and Rhoden have showered on CJ Schwan’s. The money is helping the company build a $550 million frozen food production plant in northern Sioux Falls that will employ 650 people (the math works out to about $106,000 of state aid per employee, for jobs that will pay an average of $40,000 per year).


Let us know what you think...


 

CJ Schwan’s employs Noem’s former state economic development commissioner, Steve Westra, who pledged the first state grant to the company four years ago before leaving his state job. The company also has the chairman of the state’s Board of Economic Development, Jeff Erickson, on its corporate board, while Erickson is involved with a corporation that rents space to CJ Schwan’s in a downtown Sioux Falls office building.
CJ Schwan’s is part of CJ Group, a South Korean conglomerate that had $30 billion in revenue last year. That’s an amount four times larger than South Dakota’s annual state budget.
Now, after flushing so many dollars, Rhoden wants lawmakers to pinch pennies. He’s offering schools, state employees and Medicaid-funded health care providers the equivalent of the jelly-of-the-month subscription that Clark Griswold’s boss substituted for bonuses in “Christmas Vacation.”
Clark called that “the biggest bag-over-the-head, punch-in-the-face I ever got.”
South Dakotans might feel the same way if lawmakers adopt Rhoden’s budget plan.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EM8A3851-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-03 08:11:41.189736

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — With Tyson Foods weeks away from shuttering its Lexington beef plant, the anticipated financial blow to the state is becoming clearer. Meanwhile, some workers have made strides to adjust.
The statewide economic loss, including both direct and ripple effects, is estimated at $3.28 billion a year, according to a recently released University of Nebraska-Lincoln analysis.

While public documents reported that a “mass layoff” of 3,212 Tyson workers will occur “on or around” Jan. 20, the UNL study projects more than 7,000 jobs will be lost statewide, along with an annual labor income loss of $530 million. That higher job loss count includes employees in other industries that support the Tyson beef plant operation and its workforce.
Tax revenues also will drop with the exit of Lexington’s largest employer. The projected annual decline in state personal income tax revenue is estimated at $23.2 million, according to the Dec. 22 report, and state sales tax proceeds are predicted to slide by $10 million a year.
Dawson County and neighboring communities will feel a concentrated punch, say authors and economics professors Elliott Dennis and Eric Thompson. Dennis specializes in livestock and risk management in UNL’s Department of Agricultural Economics. Thompson is an economist and director of the UNL Bureau of Business Research. 
According to their analysis, local sales tax revenues in Dawson County will likely fall by $2.77 million a year due to the plant folding. Tyson has said that certain wind-down activities may continue for a short time beyond the Jan. 20 date.
Thompson called the Tyson plant closure significant statewide, saying he hasn’t seen many local employers “of this scale” close shop in the past few decades. The UNL analysis said the Lexington plant could process nearly 5,000 cattle daily, about 4.8% of total daily U.S. beef slaughter. It said the plant’s demise marks the first time one of the “Big Four” meatpacking companies has permanently closed a major facility during the current cattle supply crunch.
Still, Thompson said, such an occurrence in a market economy is not unnatural. 
“The state needs to really focus on getting new investment,” he said.
 Norfolk plant still empty 

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has said that Tyson officials were exploring options for the Lexington facility that include repurposing it into a “value-added” ag operation. Tyson has not announced any plan.
Nebraskans lament Tyson decision to close Lexington plant with 3,200 workers

U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb, has lamented publicly that Tyson about 20 years ago “pulled out” of his hometown of Norfolk, eliminating 1,300 jobs at the company’s stripped and now-abandoned meatpacking facility there, and the property has yet to be repurposed.
Since Tyson announced the Lexington plant closure on Nov. 21, Pillen has said that more than 1,600 people attended job fairs and other events designed to connect displaced workers with potential jobs and state workforce support services. More events are scheduled.
An hour drive from Lexington, the recently opened Sustainable Beef meatpacking plant in North Platte is hiring about 100 more workers and raising its daily cattle processing goal as a result of Tyson’s Lexington announcement, the North Platte Telegraph and Wall Street Journal have reported.
Lexington-area Tyson workers were inquiring about jobs immediately after Arkansas-based Tyson announced the closure. Sustainable Beef CEO David Briggs told the Telegraph that about 400 former Tyson workers already had joined his workforce, some before and some after the Nov. 21 announcement. 
Today, the North Platte plant reportedly aims for 1,000 employees and to process 1,800 head of cattle per day.
Rancher-owned Sustainable Beef opened its plant in 2025 and was expected to create a more competitive supply chain against the “Big Four” producers. The four, Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef, control about 83-85% of U.S. beef processing capacity, which, Dennis said, has long been a point of concern for cattle producers regarding market power and price.
For the Dec. 22 economic impact report, the UNL economists drew upon multiple data sources and used the IMpact analysis for PLANing (IMPLAN) model, a tool they described as an industry standard. 



What led to packing plant shutdown?
A separate UNL analysis identified a fundamental driver of the Lexington plant’s closure as U.S. cattle supplies, saying the national herd is at a 70-year low. That Dec. 12 report said the cattle shortage stems from:

A multiyear drought in Texas and Southern Plains states that burned up pasture and increased feeding costs
Improved beef efficiency, leading to more beef per carcass due partly to genetic improvements
Slower-than-expected herd rebuilding due to aging producers, higher interest rates and producer desires to pay down debt leading to less retention of heifers
Recent disruptions, including shut down of the southern U.S. border to Mexican feeder cattle due to concerns about New World screwworm

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has said also that he was told key contributors to Tyson’s decision to end Lexington operations involved the age and inefficiencies of the factory, which was built decades ago to manufacture combines and other farm machinery before being retrofitted for a meatpacking plant around 1990.

( Photo by Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)Louisiana will leverage an anticipated $1 billion in federal funding for rural health care over the next five years by expanding existing training programs and creating new financial incentives for medical professionals to work in rural communities. 
President Donald Trump’s administration announced this week Louisiana will receive $208 million in 2026 from the massive $50 billion federal rural health fund that will be distributed over the next five years.  The amount of money each state receives will be recalculated annually until the $50 billion is exhausted in 2030. 
Louisiana officials said this initial allocation indicates the support the state can expect to garner in future years. Assuming its $208 million allocation continues, Louisiana should receive more than $1 billion for rural health care support over the five-year life of the fund, Louisiana Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said Friday in an interview. 

The state plans to use some of its money to add slots to health care training and degree programs that already exist at Louisiana public universities and colleges. The additional spots would be prioritized for students who show an interest in working in rural areas. 

Greenstein held out a mental health counseling program at Northwestern State University as an example of a degree track that could be expanded with the rural health funds. He said the university has more qualified candidates applying to that program than it can afford to train currently. 

The state is also looking to expand the Health Care Employment Reinvestment Opportunity (HERO) program, which leverages public money to attract private funding for scholarships given to health care students who agree to work in underserved communities. A new rural version of this initiative is likely to be set up with the money, Greenstein said.  
Louisiana is also looking to set up a rural clinician credit bank, where rural hospitals and other health care providers can draw down public funds in order to provide signing and retention bonuses for medical professionals. This would allow rural health care employers to compete with their urban and suburban counterparts, who have more resources to provide such incentives, Greenstein said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The money may also go toward reestablishing a state income tax credit for rural health care professionals, according to Louisiana’s application for the rural health care funding submitted last year. Approximately 400 rural health care workers took advantage of a similar tax credit when it existed previously, according to the application. 
Louisiana will also help rural hospitals purchase electronic health records systems with the money. Greenstein said this should improve access to care for people who need to see specialists. It will make it easier for rural hospital patients to have their cancer screenings, X-rays and other images transferred from their primary care provider to specialists at other hospital systems, for example. 

Putting rural patients’ records into an electronic system will also make it much easier to collect data and identify trends in health care across the state. Louisiana will be able to better respond to its health care challenges when it has access to more accurate and better information about health care delivery, Greenstein said. 

The rural health funding will also allow Louisiana to distribute wireless health care devices to more residents. 

Patients with chronic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or diabetes, would be able to take readings of their blood pressure, blood sugar and blood oxygen levels at home that could then be monitored by health care providers remotely. 
This could help rural residents, who live farther away from medical facilities, when it’s necessary to see their health care providers in person and before their condition requires emergency services, Greenstein said. 
The state will also use the federal money to partner with rural health care providers to launch nutrition programs called “food FARMacies.” Rural hospitals and other providers will be given the money to provide education on diet and disease prevention through food and meal planning. They will also be sites for direct access to fresh food through collaborations with local farmers, according to the state rural funding application. 

The health department will be using some of Louisiana’s existing programs for nutrition and fitness the LSU Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge has already developed. 

Jeff Reynolds, executive director of the Rural Hospital Coalition of Louisiana, said his organization is excited about the opportunities the funding will enable, particularly when it comes to luring more health care workers to rural institutions. 

But health care experts have warned the federal government’s $50 billion rural health care fund will not be enough to make up for massive cuts to the national Medicaid program over the next decade. Those reductions, pushed by Trump, will disproportionately impact rural hospitals because their patients are more likely to have low incomes and rely on Medicaid for health insurance.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vaughanregionalmedicalcenter_mclelland12870-1024x6831766063149-1.jpg,,,2026-01-03 06:13:13.761326

A vacant Social Security building in Baltimore County. A former power plant in Montgomery. An old mall site in Prince George’s. And that’s on top of a data center campus that has long been under development on a former industrial site in Frederick County.
It’s likely that large scale data centers, which have a large presence in neighboring Virginia, will make their way to Maryland in greater numbers in the years ahead. Yet, there isn’t a cohesive statewide policy regulating the arrival of these facilities, which demand immense amounts of energy. Instead, local jurisdictions wield much of the power to approve or deny projects through zoning rules.
“Local governments can make decisions that affect the entire state,” said Dave Arndt, co-chair of the Maryland Legislative Coalition Climate Justice Wing, who focuses on data centers. “If they approve a very large hyperscale data center that requires new transmission lines, new distribution lines and a new substation — and uses the same amount of electricity as the city of Baltimore — that’s going to increase our rates.”
During the coming General Assembly session, data center regulations are likely to draw some interest, as Maryland’s grid operator continues to issue dire warnings about just how much energy they’re projected to demand — and how that could send energy prices soaring ever further.
Perhaps one needn’t look any further than December’s special session, during which lawmakers overrode Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) veto of a study to evaluate data centers’ potential impact on the state, one of several studies the governor rejected.

Speaking from the Senate floor about the study, Sen. Charles Sydnor (D-Baltimore County) said his office learned over the summer about the data center proposal in Woodlawn — in his district — and has been in “fact-finding mode” ever since.
“The experts are adamant that across the country, and here in Maryland, we are currently rushing to approve data center projects through a poorly planned, chaotic process that lacks a foolproof regulatory framework to protect our communities from harm,” Sydnor said.
Sydnor argued that data center projects seem to offer benefits “only for the wealthy,” while the costs “are socialized for everyone else.”
Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick), speaking for an override of the governor’s veto, said looming data centers have “a very real impact. Frederick County is the first that has really started to develop our data center platforms, and right now we’re looking at a 2,200-acre parcel.”
Last session, the legislature integrated a few data center regulations in a broader package of energy reforms. For example, one provision required electric utilities to create new rate schedules for large-load customers such as data centers — subject to approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC).
“It is the intent of the General Assembly that residential retail electric customers in the State should not bear the financial risks associated with large load customers interconnecting to the electric system serving the State,” read the bill, which Moore signed in May.
But it seems clear more rule changes are coming.
For his part, the governor argues that the state should open its doors to data centers — but not without constraints.
“I do not believe in the false choice that oftentimes is being laid out: That it’s either we let Big Tech do whatever they want, and we turn intoo Northern Virginia, or it’s, don’t allow any type of economic development in the state,” Moore said during a recent news conference. “I don’t think either one of those answers are right.”
In 2024, Moore’s administration proposed a bill exempting data centers’ diesel-powered backup generators from scrutiny by the  PSC, which passed.
In his recent remarks, Moore said he envisions a process where state officials work with the impacted community, local officials and environmental groups to determine how data centers considering Maryland can contribute using “best practices,” including by bringing their own power generation along with them.
Data center woes at PJM
Under current policies, all electricity ratepayers share the costs of system expansion and maintenance. But there’s a growing push to require very large users to fund the power boosts that they require.
Maryland Gov. Wes. Moore (D) announces a new executive order focused on bolstering energy generation in Maryland on Dec. 19, 2025.
Leaders at PJM Interconnection, the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid, which includes Maryland, Washington, D.C., and a dozen other states, are currently considering a host of possible policy changes related to data centers. They’re expected to make a decision in January, after which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gets to make the final call.
A proposal from state governors, including Moore, called for PJM to provide incentives for data centers to bring their own power generation. A proposal from state lawmakers, including several Marylanders, would require PJM to curtail power to data centers in emergencies if they do not bring their own generation.
The need for regulatory change appears dire. At its energy capacity auction in December, PJM failed to procure all of the energy that it deemed necessary for the 2027-2028 delivery year — and the projected demand from data centers was largely to blame.
The shortfall doesn’t mean that the grid won’t be able to serve customers during the delivery year. But PJM aims to have a 20% reserve margin for power system emergencies, and it only secured 14.8%.
The shortage happened because PJM projections show there will be an increase of nearly 5,100 megawatts worth of data center demand for those years, though there is worry that the demand is being over-counted as data centers talk to multiple power companies about the same project.
PJM officials are optimistic that their policy changes could reduce the shortfall by lowering the projected toll of data centers.
“There are factors here that lead us to believe that we will actually be closer to the … standard once the delivery year arrives, because of things that we expect to change between now and 2027,” said Stu Bressler, executive vice president of market services and strategy at PJM.
Maryland isn’t ‘negotiating with an empty hand’
At the same time, Maryland is eyeing policy changes of its own.
Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), said she is working on a bill that would require all data centers of a certain size to receive a certificate to operate from the PSC.
She argues that the bill would provide a new layer of state scrutiny focused on energy usage, going beyond the current permitting regime at the Maryland Department of the Environment, which is more focused on emissions and site conditions. But it would also create a state-level repository of data center proposals, making it easier to keep track of proposals.
“It’s basically a transparency bill, so that we’ll have everything in one place at the state,” Hester said.
Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) said she is crafting a bill that would encourage data centers to curtail their power usage during peak periods, such as hot days, when the electrical system is taxed by heavy usage of air conditioners. The electrical system is built around withstanding the peaks, Charkoudian said, even though most of the year, the system is far from maxed out.
“I’m really focused on: When data centers are coming online in Maryland, how can they be part of the solution for the 100 hours a year where their presence is going to lead to driving up costs?” Charkoudian said.
Data centers could reduce their usage by moving particular work to non-peak periods, or pre-cooling their equipment to avoid cooling during the hottest time of the day, when the grid will be most taxed, Charkoudian said.
Charkoudian said her bill will also incentivize data centers to build battery energy storage facilities in their areas, so that they could turn to stored power during peak periods.
Arndt from the Climate Justice Wing called Charkoudian’s bill a “win-win-win situation.”

“They [data centers] stay operational. The grid stays operational. We win because we don’t have to build new peaker plants,” Arndt said, referring to plants that are called on in peak demand periods.
But it’s important that the bill continue to ensure that data centers use clean backup power during peak periods, rather than relying on fossil fuel backup generators, Arndt cautioned.
“We don’t want diesel generators running for four hours in a community just because we’re running low on energy.” Arndt said.
Angie McCarthy, Maryland conservation advocate at Nature Forward, said her group supports Charkoudian’s bill, though she knows it won’t come without controversy. She expects data center players to argue that onerous regulations could cause data centers to seek sites in nearby states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, rather than Maryland.
“From our perspective, Maryland is seen as a prime spot for data center development, because we have such access to the fiber-optic cables and other infrastructure that Virginia has installed in their state,” McCarthy said. “We aren’t negotiating with an empty hand.”
The Maryland Tech Council, a trade association representing technology companies, has focused much of its recent messaging on the economic boost that data centers can bring to the state.
A typical 800,000 square foot data center produces about 5,000 jobs during construction, along with $775 million in economic activity and $18 million in state tax revenue, according to a Tech Council report issued in August. During operation, a typical facility spurs 500 permanent jobs, $31 million in annual compensation and $14 million in annual state tax revenue, according to the study, conducted by the Sage Policy Group, a Baltimore-based firm led by economist Anirban Basu.
In a more recent report, the Tech Council zeroed in on Prince George’s County, arguing that a “mid-sized” data center development would generate over $1 billion in economic activity during construction, and $20 million in annual tax revenue for the county.
“As other states aggressively compete for data center investment, Maryland cannot afford to sit on the sidelines,” reads the August report. “By welcoming responsible data center development, Maryland can address its immediate fiscal and economic challenges while positioning itself as a leader in the digital economy for decades to come. The time to act is now; before this opportunity, like so many others, migrates to neighboring states with more favorable business environments.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2161851139.jpg,,,2026-01-03 09:56:46.080237

Scott Applewhite/AP)The midterm elections for Congress won’t take place until November, but already a record number of members have declared their intention not to run — a total of 43 in the House, plus 10 senators. Perhaps the most high-profile person to depart, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced her intention in November not just to retire but to resign from Congress entirely on Jan. 5 — a full year before her term was set to expire.
There are political dynamics that explain this rush to the exits, including frustrations with gridlock and President Donald Trump’s lackluster approval ratings, which could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.
Rather than get swept away by a prospective “blue wave” favoring Democrats — or possibly daunted by the monumental effort it would take to survive — many Republicans have decided to fold up the beach chair and head home before the wave crashes.
As of now, two dozen Republican House members have either resigned from the House or announced their intent to not run for reelection in 2026. With only two exceptions — Republicans in 2018 and 2020 — this is more departures from either party at this point in the election calendar than any other cycle over the past 20 years.
There is also growing concern within the House Republican caucus that Greene’s announcement is a canary in the coal mine and that multiple resignations will follow.
As a political scientist who studies Congress and politicians’ reelection strategies, I’m not surprised to see many House members leaving ahead of what’s shaping up to be a difficult midterm for the GOP. Still, the sheer numbers of people not running tells us something about broader dissatisfaction with Washington.
 
Why do members leave Congress?
Many planned departures are true retirements involving older and more experienced members.
For example, 78-year-old Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler is retiring after 34 years, following mounting pressure from upstart challengers and a growing consensus among Democrats that it’s time for older politicians to step aside. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker who will turn 86 in March, is also retiring.
Sometimes, members of Congress depart for the same reasons workers might leave any job. Like many Americans, members of Congress might find something more attractive elsewhere. Retiring members are attractive hires for lobbying firms and corporations, thanks to their insider knowledge and connections within the institution. These firms usually offer much higher salaries than members are used to in Congress, which may explain why more than half of all living former members are lobbyists of some kind.
Other members remain ambitious for elective office and decide to use their position in Congress as a springboard for another position. Members of the House regularly retire to run for a Senate seat, such as, in this cycle, Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens of Michigan. Others run for executive offices, including governor, such as Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.
But some are leaving Congress due to growing frustration with the job and an inability to get things done. Specifically, many retiring members cite growing dysfunction within their own party, or in Congress as a whole, as the reason they’re moving on.
In a statement announcing his departure in June, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., mused that “between spending another six years navigating the political theater and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with my family,” it was “not a hard choice” to leave the Senate.
 
What’s unique about 2026?
In addition, there are a few other factors that can help explain why so many Republicans in particular are heading for the exits leading up to 2026.
The shifting of boundaries that has come with the mid-decade redistricting process in several states this year has scrambled members’ priorities. Unfamiliar districts can drive incumbents to early retirement by severing their connection with well-established constituencies.
In Texas, six Republicans and three Democrats — nearly a quarter of the state’s entire House delegation — are either retiring or running for other offices, due in part to that state’s new gerrymander for 2026.
All decisions about retirement and reelection are sifted through the filter of electoral and partisan considerations. A phenomenon called “thermostatic politics” predicts that parties currently in power, particularly in the White House, tend to face a backlash from voters in the following election. In other words, the president’s party nearly always loses seats in midterms.
In 2006 and 2018, for example, Republican members of Congress were weighed down by the reputations of unpopular Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Trump. Republicans had arguably even greater success in midterm elections during Barack Obama’s presidency.

Currently, 2026 looks like it will present a poor national environment for Republicans. Trump remains highly unpopular, according to polls, and Democrats are opening up a consistent lead in the “generic ballot” question, which asks respondents which party they intend to support in the 2026 midterms without reference to individual candidates.
Democrats have already been overperforming in special elections, as well as the general election in November in states such as New Jersey and Virginia, which held elections for governor. Democrats are on average running 13 points ahead of Kamala Harris’ performance in the 2024 election.
As a result, even Republicans in districts thought to be safe for their party may see themselves in enough danger to abandon the fight in advance.
 
Retirement vs. resignation
One final, unique aspect of this election cycle with major consequences is not an electoral but an institutional one.
House conservatives are quietly revolting against Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership style. That members may be frustrated enough not just to retire but resign in advance, leaving their seats temporarily vacant, is a notable sign of dysfunction in the U.S. House.
This also could have a major impact on policy, given how slim the Republicans’ majority in the lower chamber is already. Whatever the outcome of the midterms in November, these departures clearly matter in Washington and offer important signals about the chaos in Congress.

The Chesapeake Bay Journal
One of the murkiest questions surrounding the Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort seems like it should be the easiest to answer: Is the water getting clearer?
For decades, widely used data indicate that, overall, water clarity is getting worse.
Earlier this year, for instance, the Chesapeake Bay Report Card released by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science reported that 2024 water clarity was “very poor” and that “water clarity scores continue to show a significant decline over time.”
One of the major goals of the state-federal Bay Program partnership is to reduce the amount of sediment and nutrients entering the Bay to improve clarity so that underwater grass beds can get enough light to survive.
The region has spent billions of dollars to control sediment and nutrient-fueled algae blooms that cloud the water — seemingly without significant results.
Yet underwater grass beds in the Bay have expanded even as data seem to show that the water is murkier. The amount of submerged aquatic vegetation, or SAV, increased from 38,227 acres in 1984 to 78,451 acres last year.

If the water is cloudy, how are grasses getting enough light to expand?
A recent analysis published in the Annual Review of Marine Science came up with an answer, though it is murky too: The amount of light available for plants is improving, even if it doesn’t always look that way.
“For a long time, the story was that we’ve been cleaning up the watershed, but clarity is not improving,” said Jessie Turner, an assistant professor in the Department of Ocean and Earth Sciences at Old Dominion University, who was the lead author of the journal article.
“That has switched, but it was hard to untangle things,” she said.
Turner has been trying to sort out the story for nearly a decade, first as a student at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and then in her current position. Former colleagues from VIMS and the University of Delaware are co-authors of the article.
It turns out that how far we see into the water — how visibly “clear” it is — is not the same thing as how much light is passing through that water.
The Bay goal is to get more light to underwater plants, but the main tool for measuring clarity has been the Secchi disk — a black and white disk that is lowered into the water until it disappears. The Secchi disk is cheap and easy to use and has been relied upon for decades by researchers and citizen scientists.
But it measures visual clarity, not the amount or quality of light that might be reaching plants on the bottom.
Bay water is filled with tiny particles. Some are bits of sediment, but many are tiny algae cells and microscopic bits of detritus from organic material that is breaking down in the water.
Those organic particles limit visibility, but they don’t block light waves. Instead, they scatter them, reflecting light through the water column. Turner likens it to headlights in a fog bank. The headlights brighten the fog, which is made up of tiny water particles, but a driver can’t see very far into it.
“You can have a lot of light getting to your eyeball in the fog, but the visibility is very poor,” Turner said. “In the water, that would look like a very shallow Secchi depth reading. But you still have enough light for something like seagrass.”
“What ultimately matters to something like SAV is how much light is getting to the bottom,” she said.
When Turner and her colleagues examined historical data gathered with specialized light sensors, they found a different trend than those seen with Secchi disks.
Data from those sensors, which assess the amount of sunlight that is penetrating the water, including the specific wavelengths that are important for plant photosynthesis, show improvements since around 1990.

Many factors affect clarity and light availability, and their relative importance varies from place to place. Sorting them out is complex. For instance, the amount of sediment in the water has slowly declined over time. That has helped clear the water, but clearer water allows for more algal growth, Turner said, which in turn contributes to more tiny particles of organic material. The particles gradually settle to the bottom but are easily resuspended.
That can cloud the water from a Secchi disk perspective, but the increased amount of tiny organic particles, rather than larger sediment particles, can improve light.
Trying to understand all those factors, Turner said, “is a little bit of a maze.”
Water clarity is still important, she noted. Someone diving in the Bay wants to be able to see where they are going, and someone throwing a fishing line into the water wants a fish to be able to spot bait at the end of the line.
Future nutrient reductions should further reduce algae production, and over time that could improve clarity. That might be happening — Secchi disk readings in the last decade do show a slight improvement.
But it’s hard to predict whether Bay clarity goals will be met, Turner said. That’s because the Bay system has been fundamentally changed over the decades by things such as marsh loss, shoreline hardening and the transformation of its watershed to meet the needs of a growing population.
“A recovered Chesapeake Bay with improved water clarity may not resemble the ecosystem that we predict or expect,” Turner wrote in the paper. As a result, the future Bay may have a mix of different particle types and sizes than it did in the past, which means expectations about future clarity may be altered as well.
The good news is that even if clarity goals are not fully attained, continued light improvements will have ecological benefits, especially for grass beds, which will result in healthier ecosystems over time and more habitat for fish and crabs.
“We may get to a point where you still can’t see the bottom when you go swimming in a lot of places,” Turner said. “But if the ecosystem is healthy in terms of what’s living in it, then maybe that’s a success story in and of itself.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/692f0bc449c13-1-1024x667.jpeg,,,2026-01-03 10:56:54.767648

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Although a majority ruling by the Montana Supreme Court dismissed a larger professional misconduct case against Attorney General Austin Knudsen, the court opinion created a new precedent in stating that the Attorney General “is subject to regulation under the Commission (on Practice) and this Court’s authority to regulate the practice of law.” 
The case against the AG has stretched back to a 2021 dispute between the Legislative branch and the state Supreme Court and ultimately embroiled all three branches in murky allegations of impropriety, focusing on Knudsen’s actions while defending the Legislative and administrative branches. 
In 2023, the Office for Disciplinary Counsel, which handles discipline for members of the state bar, filed a complaint alleging Knudsen broke rules of professional conduct in 41 separate counts — which Knudsen’s lawyers described as a “political stunt.”
Subsequently, in 2024, the Commission on Practice, which regulates lawyers, recommended the state Supreme Court suspend him for 90 days. Knudsen is a Republican in his second term as AG.
In an order Wednesday, the Supreme Court, which included five district court judges as a majority of the state’s highest court recused themselves, dismissed the recommendation to suspend Knudsen, citing in part violations to his due process rights, although Justice Katherine Bidegaray dissented.
But the court had to grapple with a number of points in its deliberations, including arguments that Knudsen, as an elected official in the executive branch, couldn’t be regulated by another branch of government.
The court opinion, written by Chief Justice Cory Swanson, created precedent in stating that the Attorney General is subject to the Commission on Practice and ultimate jurisdiction of the Montana Supreme Court.
In recent years in Montana, Republicans including Knudsen have been highly critical of the judiciary.

While the court asserted its own jurisdiction and dismissed much of the case against Knudsen, Swanson wrote that Knudsen’s actions “throughout the saga of 2021 were beyond what we have seen any competent attorney, let alone the Attorney General, do.”
Swanson added that the opinion of the court “suffices as the Court’s public admonition regarding the rule violations.”
“Moreover, we plainly warn all Montana attorneys, including Knudsen and his subordinates, to obey lawful orders of all courts,” the opinion said.
In the opinion, the court also addressed whether Knudsen had been afforded due process, and whether the allegations against him were factual. 
In addressing the specific complaints against Knudsen, mostly related to disobeying court orders and making statements critical of the Supreme Court, the ruling found that Knudsen violated two rules of professional conduct, but that the Commission “failed to provide legal justification” and proof that he had violated three other rules of professional conduct. 
However, the court also found several instances where Knudsen successfully argued that his due process had been violated. 
In one instance, the Commission excluded an expert witness without allowing Knudsen time to respond to a motion, while in another the court stated that the Commission issued “inadequate conclusions of law.”
“This due process violation alone is sufficiently serious to vacate the Commission’s decision and remand it for a new proceeding or entry of an amended decision explaining its conclusions of law,” the ruling stated. But, “given the time, expense and turmoil that have exceeded all expectations in this proceeding, we have no intention of remanding this matter for another round.”
The majority opinion used those instances as reasoning for dismissal and for not disciplining Knudsen for the actions that were proven violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, a justification Bidegaray described as “unprecedented” in her dissent. 
In a statement, Knudsen expressed his appreciation for the Supreme Court “bringing this frivolous complaint to a long-overdue conclusion.”
“We’ve said it from the very beginning, this was nothing more than a political stunt,” Knudsen said. 
 DISSENT

While the five district court judges appointed to hear the case agreed with Swanson, Supreme Court Justice Katherine Bidegaray, one of the court’s newest members, dissented, arguing that finding a lawyer broke rules of conduct but refusing to discipline them weakened the court’s authority and erodes confidence in the legal system. 
Bidegaray said the court record, and state precedent, don’t justify nullifying Knudsen’s disciplinary record “or insulating an elected attorney from professional accountability.”
While she concurred with much of the majority opinion, she added that she would hold Knudsen violated a third professional rule of conduct by disobeying a court order that “was prejudicial to the administration of justice.”
She also pushed back against the conclusions that Knudsen’s due process rights were violated by the Commission, and that none of the actions taken resulted in substantial prejudice against him — indeed a two-day hearing, plus the Supreme Court’s ability to review the written decisions, gave Knudsen his due process, she wrote. 
But Bidegaray’s biggest dissent came from the “unprecedented and extraordinary decision” to not discipline Knudsen for the professional violations the court agreed Knudsen committed. 
“There has never been a case where this Court dismissed a disciplinary action while also holding that the attorney committed proven misconduct,” she wrote. “Until today.”
She added that dismissal ultimately nullifies the entire proceedings of the case, and “such a remedy is incompatible with our constitutional obligation to regulate the bar and protect the public.”
Bidegaray also pointed out some irregularities in how the Supreme Court handled the case, comparing them to ones made by Commission that were considered egregious enough to warrant due process violations. 
“The Court appears to have a different standard for adherence to its own procedural rules in these proceedings,” she wrote.
Bidegaray wrote she would impose a public censure, a 30-day suspension and require Knudsen to pay for litigation costs.
“Discipline is not punitive; it is protective—of the public, the courts, and the profession—and serves to preserve confidence in the fair and orderly administration of justice,” she wrote.
In the majority opinion, Swanson noted Bidegaray’s dissent and stated that while her arguments could be correct, the failings by the Commission throughout the process — with due process requirements, and inadequate findings of fact and conclusions of law — precluded such a conclusion. 
“When an attorney — from the newest associate in the smallest firm to the elected official who supervises more lawyers than any other in the state — faces a potential loss of professional licensing, then we expect the proceeding to carry the burden of persuasion and uphold the procedural due process standards written in the rules and in our caselaw,” Swanson wrote. “The Commission failed to do so in numerous respects here, and we only weaken our regulation of the practice of law if we overlook those violations.”

Recent commentaries published in VTDigger by Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources; Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service; and Miro Weinberger, executive chair of Let’s Build Homes, try to assert that we need to build 40,000 new homes within the next four years. Even Gov. Phil Scott has issued a controversial executive order to boost housing production. Adding to this rush to grow, the Vermont Futures Project has proposed increasing the Vermont population to 802,000. We feel that these initiatives, when combined, are leading us down a path toward growth that will not serve us well.
Growth will inevitably continue in Vermont, but is growth something we want to promote or try to manage? Healthy growth occurs naturally when we foster the conditions that support growth. It is unnecessary and irresponsible to start by building 40,000 new homes by 2030, and we certainly don’t need to increase our population by 150,000 within the decade, especially in Chittenden County, as promoted by the Vermont Futures Project.
We have no argument with those who believe Vermont desperately needs more affordable apartments, duplexes, multifamily homes, condominiums and single-family starter homes. But that is not what has been happening for the last 20 years in Chittenden County, and that’s not what the housing industry is proposing for the future. As we know, there are numerous negative impacts from short-sighted, unsustainable, sprawling growth on municipal services, and it’s the taxpayers who ultimately bear the burden from expensive, market-driven development projects.
The most disappointing and glaring omission in the abundance discussion is simply defining abundance. Of what? Some abundance proponents focus on more energy and less regulation to promote economic development, while advocates in Vermont are focusing on housing. But what happens if we unfetter the constraints imposed by energy, natural resources and Vermont’s strong environmental regulations, and we build those new homes?
Do we not then need an abundance of more clean water? Agricultural land to produce more food? More storm, sewer and water treatment systems? More waste and recycle facilities? More municipal personnel in our towns and village offices? Teachers for the new children. Police, fire responders and maintenance workers for our roads and parklands, to mention just a few impacts of more energy, housing and people? Abundance leads to a need for more abundance, and that has not been adequately addressed by the proponents of the Abundance Agenda in Vermont. That’s the abundance myth.
As a nation, we are conflicted about growth and yet addicted to it. Our existential challenge is to accept a vision of growth within our limited financial capacity and shrinking natural resources. Shortsighted, unsustainable growth is enticing because of the apparent short-term improvements to our standard of living. However, the long-term impacts can bring irreparable damage to what feels like home. Increasingly, we are dealing with the consequences of negative impacts and not planning accordingly for sustainable growth.
Struggling to find an affordable place to live, to pay for all the impacts resulting from an abundance of excessive growth, is the unavoidable but unaddressed elephant in the room. So far, none of the individuals mentioned at the beginning of this commentary or any representative from the organizations they represent have addressed this issue.
Here in Vermont, the home affordability crisis is exacerbated by the growing capture of the housing market by large equity firms and out-of-state investors who purchase single-family homes and rental properties, reducing homeownership opportunities and driving up the cost of rents and housing prices. For those abundance advocates concerned with inhibitors of growth, it is large corporations with lobbying teams that deserve everyone’s greater scrutiny, not necessarily state or local regulations enforced by our small towns and villages.
So, when Moore, Johnson, Weinberger and Scott talk about reducing costs, or about opponents preserving the existing regulatory barriers, or write that we need affordable housing, or that Vermont needs an abundance agenda, or that environmentalists are creating political theater, or that too many families remain priced out of the communities where they grew up, keep in mind the exploitation of the Abundance Agenda, that unspoken elephant in the room. Abundance inevitably leads to a need for more services and natural resources. For private investors, corporations and out-of-state profiteers, that’s not their concern. Vermont’s proposed Abundance Agenda is a gold mine for them, unattainable for most struggling Vermonters.
Abundance needs to be for everyone, not just for those who will destroy our environment, deplete our natural resources and make excessive profits. If it does not, abundance, as defined by influential leaders in Vermont, will remain a hijacked myth and a tool for the rich to get richer.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Clarkson Regional Health Services, the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s longtime private partner in providing medical care and hospital services, is offering the university system a chance to buy out its share of the Nebraska Medicine partnership for $500 million, both groups announced Friday.
The NU Board of Regents is set to consider the transaction in a discussion and vote planned Jan. 9 that appears to have already secured significant political support, including from Gov. Jim Pillen, a former NU regent. He said the change, if approved, would help keep the hospital in Nebraska hands.
“I strongly support this transaction, because it will directly benefit the citizens of our great state by bringing them better health care and by further strengthening the University of Nebraska system,” Pillen said in a statement.
University officials said it was not yet clear how much of the $500 million would be privately funded and how much would be sought from state taxpayers as part of a budget process that NU acknowledges comes at a time when the purse strings are already tight from a projected revenue shortfall, and campuses have already faced budget cuts.
Dr. Jeffrey Gold, president of the NU system and a former UNMC chancellor, said patients would see no changes in the care or cost of medical care they receive in a Nebraska Medicine clinic or to the group’s health care workforce support structure that stretches “border to border.”
The key difference would be Nebraska Medicine’s governance structure shifting from two owners to one, he said. Many Nebraskans already assume UNMC runs the Med Center and don’t know that Nebraska Medicine’s clinics have involved Clarkson as a private partner since 1997, or that the east Omaha hospital has since the 1950s.
Gold said UNMC and the NU system would benefit from joining top fellow academic medical centers at the University of Iowa, the University of Michigan and Ohio State University, which oversee the clinical and hospital side of respective medical nonprofits, in addition to the medical training and teaching. 
The new-look Nebraska Medicine would still be governed by the Nebraska Medicine board, not the NU Board of Regents, Gold explained. That group has a duty to make sure the hospital is providing quality care to patients.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“What does the average consumer really care about this?” Gold asked, repeating a reporter’s question. “The answer really is what I would characterize as stability, to make us, from a governance perspective, look a lot more like our peers.”
Part of the transaction is also valuable for helping UNMC consolidate Clarkson properties around the Med Center campus, where growth and construction cranes are as common as ambulance arrivals. And Clarkson, which helped the university build the core hospital building at 42nd and Dewey Streets, has pledged a $200 million gift to help replace it.
Today, the buildings around UNMC that house doctors’ offices and the Clarkson Tower at Nebraska Medical Center are owned by Clarkson and made available for use by Nebraska Medicine at drastically reduced leases or for no lease at all.
Gold says renters occupy much of those Clarkson properties, and he expects the combination of revenues from that real estate, debt service and some public dollars to be used to cover and recoup the $500 million, though funders are still sorting out the mix. He said none of the public project funding would pull from the budgets of other NU campuses. 
Considering the quality of health care offered at Nebraska Medicine, Gold said he could see a scenario in which some of the revenue streams provided by Nebraska Medicine could help keep NU tuition more affordable than it might be otherwise.
Clarkson, for its part, appears poised to transition from its longtime focus on providing health care to using funds from the sale to grow a private foundation focused on grants aimed at making Nebraska the healthiest state and improving how health care is delivered here.
“Clarkson’s partnership with the university to establish and grow Nebraska Medicine has been a successful one, and we are proud of the advancements we have made together in serving our community,” said Jim Landen, chairman of the Clarkson board. 
Dr. Bill Lydiatt, CEO of Clarkson and a head-and-neck surgical oncologist, said he is excited to give to its longtime partners at NU and “provide them with the best path toward continuing the important work of Nebraska Medicine, including serving as one of the finest teaching hospitals.”
Gold understands he and NU will face financial skeptics on and off campus by seeking a $500 million project at a time of slimmer budgets, but he said the other options for UNMC clinical partners would have involved private partners from out of state, including some he called “far less attractive.”
His goal, if the regents agree, is to close the transaction within a six-month window and keep building. 
“This is as much to protect this critical asset as a Nebraska public asset as it is anything else,” Gold said.

Sarah Andrews is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
WATERBURY — For 48 years, George Woodard woke up before dawn and milked his cows. His day would end the same way, in his barn with the herd. 
For many of those years, Woodard’s 200-acre farm was booming. Now, the milking stalls in his barn sit empty, only occasionally visited by Woodard and his tabbycat, Jack. 
“It was a time which was precious. And it’s gone,” Woodard said.
Waterbury was once a dairy town. It’s home to Ben & Jerry’s Factory Store, a magnet for tourists seeking socially-responsible, locally-sourced ice cream.
But if they want to see a working dairy farm, they’ll have to go elsewhere. Rising costs of production and competition from ever-growing commercial dairies have driven out Waterbury’s dairy farms.
Until recently, Waterbury was home to three commercial dairy farms: the Wallaces’, the Davises’, and the Woodards’. Today, there are none.
Rosina Wallace feeds one of two cows she keeps as pets on her Waterbury farm. Wallace stopped dairy farming in 2017. Photo by Sarah Andrews.
Ten years ago, a fire destroyed Rosina Wallace’s dairy barn, killing her entire herd of 23 cows. After that, it was too expensive to start over. 
“The dairy industry does not want small farmers,” Wallace said. “Financially, it was just impossible for me to get back into it.”
In 1943, Mark Davis’ grandparents bought nearly 200 acres of grazing land to start their farm. 
Davis started milking when he was 14. Later, his wife, Maureen, and their children all took part in managing the herd of more than 40 cows – it’s not a job that can be done alone. 
Davis stopped milking about two years ago, after years of losing money.
“It was a great job, a great way to grow up, a great way to raise our kids. But it’s a very hard way to make a living,” Davis said. “It’s bad for a while, and then it gets worse.”
Woodard’s grandfather bought their Loomis Hill farm in 1912. He used the land for logging and sugaring. 
In 1973, Woodard graduated from Vermont Technical College and returned to Loomis Hill. He started by buying 10 heifer calves. Then, he bought 10 more. By December of 1975, the Woodards started shipping milk.
Across town, Wallace’s great-grandfather bought their Blush Hill Road farmland in 1866. For many years, it was mainly operating as a maple farm and fruit orchard. Wallace’s father decided to transition the farm to dairy after he finished college.
As Wallace’s father got older, he asked her to take over the farm. Wallace couldn’t wait. 
“I grew up helping on the farm all the time. It just never occurred to me that I could be the farmer,” Wallace said. “I gladly came back to the farm and worked with my dad to learn everything.” 
In the 2000s, the price that large milk buyers offered small farms plummeted. They reduced the amount of milk purchased from small dairies. 
Woodard and Wallace, like many other small dairies, started producing organic milk. The buyers were willing to pay more, and demand was higher.
The costs were higher, too. Organic feed was expensive, and the demands of keeping the herd healthy were high. 
“The last 10 years that I farmed, I was organic,” Wallace said. “I thought being organic would help me to be able to stay healthier financially, but then the price of the grain more than doubled.”
Davis didn’t go organic, but expenses still soared. The price farmers received for their milk just couldn’t keep up with the rising costs of feed, maintenance, labor, and processing.  
“My dad had a saying about it. The milk price goes in cycles; it’s bad for a while, and then it gets worse,” Wallace said. 
Dairy death spiral
Those rising costs led to a loss of the support businesses that dairy farms depend upon – a sort of dairy death spiral.
Throughout the 20th century, Waterbury had an agricultural economy. There were two creameries in town, and a large animal veterinarian.
Over time, as small dairies started to close, so did those supporting agricultural services. Emergency veterinarians became harder to find, coming from Waitsfield or Warren. When Waterbury’s creameries closed, shipping milk became more costly. 
As processing shifted to larger plants, milk had to move larger distances, putting small dairies at a disadvantage, said Silene DeCiucies. She’s with the Center for an Agricultural Economy, a nonprofit that advocates for local farmers.
“The economy of scale is very real in dairy, and there’s nothing going against it currently in Vermont,” DeCiucies said.
The story of dairy in Waterbury mirrors the trends in Vermont as a whole. Over the last decade, the number of dairy farms in Vermont has fallen from more than 900 to fewer than 500 today.
As Vermont loses dairy farms, the remaining ones are becoming larger. Graph via Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets.
Meanwhile, the size of those remaining farms has increased. Only 2% were considered large farms a decade ago; now, 9% have herds of 700 or more cows.
These changing economic factors slowly pushed Davis, Woodard and Wallace out of milking. Davis says 2014 was the last year his farm turned a profit. 
“I should have stopped 20 years earlier than I did, because, you know, we were feeding a lot of money that was made in the past back into it, just to keep things going,” Davis said.

In 2021, Woodard stopped milking. Davis followed two years later. Now, both farmers run small beef operations. Beef requires less labor, and the costs of production are lower and more stable. 
Woodard now has 10 cattle, Davis has 26. Instead of going to the barn every 12 hours to milk, the farmers spend their time managing the pasture and feed. It’s a much easier way to farm. 
Dairy farming is hard work, and after almost 50 years, Davis welcomes the change of pace.
“I’ve spent my whole lifetime looking for an off switch on a cow, and I’ve never found one,” Davis said.
After the fire destroyed Wallace’s barn and she lost her herd, dairy farming was no longer an option. 
“I really miss it. And if I’d had my choice, I’d still be dairy farming.” Wallace said. “The good thing is I never would have been smart enough to stop when I should have.”
Wallace doesn’t plan to make the transition to raising beef. For her, sending her animals to be processed for beef is too emotionally difficult. 
“For me, the hardest part of dairy farming was determining when I had to pronounce a death sentence for an animal,” Wallace said.
She now takes care of two alpacas, whose wool she processes for textiles. Her farm also is home to her two beloved steers, Ferdinand and Gad.
But that farm no longer turns a profit. Wallace now works at the Cabot Creamery Store, another tourist-focused dairy attraction down the road from Ben & Jerry’s. 
“It’s what I really, really, really like doing, but as long as I have my animals and I’m not making enough money off my animals to keep going, I keep my day job,” Wallace said.
Can small dairy farms survive?
Waterbury’s experience begs the question — Is it possible for any small dairy farm to survive in today’s Vermont?
Laura Ginsburg, an expert at the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food, and Markets, thinks so.
“People sometimes get stuck at looking at what’s worked in the past, that it should work into the future. But we’re in a very different place today than we were even five years ago,” Ginsburg said.
There is a stable market for organic dairy, and she said innovations can cut costs. 
“I do think there is opportunity, it’s just going to look different than it’s looked in the past,” said Ginsburg.
Young farmers are struggling to start their own dairies. Land costs are just too high. 
“You can only get so much manure in a 5-gallon bucket. And when the 5-gallon bucket is full, there’s no room left for anything else,” Woodard said.
“The same thing has happened with land. You can’t buy a farm anymore,” Woodard said
Today, dairy farming is gone in Waterbury, and it doesn’t seem likely to return. Wallace recognizes that large dairy farms are likely to continue to outcompete smaller ones. 
“Some things change, but some things stay the same, and the whole idea of getting bigger in order to survive probably isn’t going to go away,” Wallace said.
High land prices offer an easy way for struggling farmers to exit the business. But even though they are done with dairy, Wallace, Woodard, and Davis plan to continue farming on their land as long as they are able.
“You’re sitting on a gold mine, but the only way you can, you know, retrieve the gold is to get off the gold mine,” Davis said.
Woodard doesn’t know what the next century will bring to his farm. He says it’s unlikely his kids will want to farm.
But running one of the last dairy farms in Waterbury was a good life, he said — one he would not trade.
“If you’ve got a farm, OK, you’re not going to be making a whole crap load of money, but at the end of 50 years, you still have that place, and you’ve made a living on that place,” Woodard said. 
Wallace has no children, so her niece will take over the fifth-generation farm someday. She hopes her niece will continue to run it as a farm.
“Brown cows and green grass is a beautiful sight,” Wallace said.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ludlow police chief ID’d as shooter of man allegedly armed with knife in New Year’s Day incident.","Ludlow Police Chief Jeffrey Warfle shot and injured a man on New Year’s Day after the man allegedly pulled a knife at a downtown hotel where he had been living, according to Vermont State Police. 
The wounded man, Jaime Gomez, 18, was taken to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, where he was continuing to receive care, Vermont State Police said in a press release Friday.

State police, who are heading up the investigation, had reported Thursday that Gomez was in stable condition. He is facing two felony charges, state police said.
Police had released few details about the Thursday morning shooting prior to issuing the press release late Friday afternoon that provided more information. According to the release, at about 6 a.m. Thursday, local police received a call reporting a disturbance at the Fox Run Inn on Main Street. 
Warfle responded to the scene and encountered Gomez who, according to the release, was reported “to be agitated and destroying property” there.
“Video of the encounter shows the chief spoke with Gomez and attempted to de-escalate the situation,” the release stated, adding that as Warfle spoke to a witness, Gomez approached them and refused to follow Warfle’s commands.
Gomez, the release stated, then “pulled an item from his pocket and lunged at the chief. At that point Chief Warfle fired his service weapon, striking Gomez, who then dropped a knife.”
The release did not specify how many shots Warfle fired or where Gomez was struck.
After the shooting, Warfle called for medical assistance for Gomez and for additional first responders to come to the scene, the release stated.
The state police have obtained an arrest warrant for Gomez on one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and another of attempted aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to the release. It’s unclear who the victim was in connection with each charge.
State police referred questions about Warfle’s employment status to the Ludlow Police Department. A person who answered a call to the police department Friday afternoon said Warfle was on leave and would not be back for a few days. 
The Vermont Attorney General’s Office and a county state’s attorney’s office will conduct separate use-of-force reviews into the shooting to determine if the police chief’s actions were legally justified.
The last police-involved shooting in Ludlow took place in August 2022, when Ludlow Police Officer Zachary Paul fatally shot 35-year-old Michael Mills, of Cavendish, following a car chase. Mills was reportedly dealing with a mental health crisis and had made many calls to police that night before the pursuit. Reviews by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office and the Orange County State’s Attorney’s Office found that Paul’s use of force was “objectively reasonable and justified.”
Paul, who was 21 at the time, had recently joined the Ludlow Police Department after graduating from the Vermont Police Academy. At the time of the shooting, Warfle was in the cruiser with Paul and was his field training officer. Warfle did not fire his gun during the incident. 
Warfle, who was appointed Ludlow’s police chief last year, had previously worked as a Rutland City police officer. In that position, he was the subject of a Brady letter in February 2019. The letters are filed by prosecutors when an officer’s credibility is called into question and can often mean the end of an officer’s career. 
Then-Rutland County State’s Attorney Rose Kennedy drafted the letter. She said the letter stemmed from Warfle issuing a citation to a person on a charge of disorderly conduct, but following a complaint Warfle admitted that the person’s conduct did not rise to the level of a charge. 
According to the state police press release Friday, Warfle has been cooperating with investigators but had yet to be interviewed.

(Photo by Lance Cpl. Harleigh Faulk/U.S. Marine Corps)Even as Baltimore celebrates a historic drop in homicides, everyone seems to have a different opinion about whether crime by the city’s young people is falling, rising, changing, or staying the same. When those opinions are based on a personal experience of harm, they deserve compassion and support. When they are not, it is reasonable to ask, What evidence are we drawing from?
With support from the Abell Foundation, I have been tracking available youth justice data to fact-check commonly heard claims about Baltimore crime involving young people and to gauge how the system is responding.
Here are some of the things I found: Youth offending has mostly continued its long decline in Baltimore, as it has nationally; the COVID-19 pandemic was a tremendous disruptor that made at least three years — 2020, 2021 and 2022 — unreliable outliers in almost any extended trend analysis; and the youth justice system, in Baltimore and statewide, deserves a lot more informed scrutiny.
Arrest data is a widely accepted, if imperfect, measure of youth offending. Recently published studies show that arrests of young people in Baltimore and across the nation have been trending down for many years, took a deep dive during the COVID-19 pandemic, and began recovering to pre-pandemic levels around 2023. The most reliable long-term data for Baltimore, from the state’s Department of Juvenile Services (DJS), shows that FY 2019 was the last year of a steady decline prior to the appearance of COVID-19, with 1,387 “complaints”—incidents reported to the agency by police and other sources. By FY 2021, when the pandemic was having its greatest impact, DJS received just 582 complaints. The numbers have rebounded since then, to 1,768 in FY 2025, but they are still well below levels recorded prior to FY 2019.

A corollary to widespread concerns about youth offending are frequently heard complaints about how the justice system is holding Baltimore young people accountable for crimes they may have committed. Once again, the evidence is not what media headlines might lead us to believe; in some ways the data suggest we are being too tough.
Maryland’s practice of automatically sending some arrested youth directly into the adult criminal justice system based on charges from police and prosecutors is one example. This practice — which Maryland does more than nearly every other state — has youths 17 and younger facing adult sentences and, if convicted, possible time in adult facilities.
Yet data published online by the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention and Protection (GOCPP) shows that since FY 2021 the most common autocharge offense statewide has been illegal gun possession. According to data shared directly by GOCPP,  in Baltimore illegal gun charges have been the most common autocharge offense since at least FY 2019. In FY 2024 they accounted for nearly half — 45% — of all such charges in the city.
No one disputes that kids and illegal guns are an awful combination that demands serious attention and action. But research has shown that most youth who arm themselves do so because they are afraid, not because they want to hurt someone.
New interventions like DJS’ Thrive Academy and the city’s Group Violence Reduction Strategy suggest there may be better ways to allay these fears than months of pretrial detention and threats of time in an adult prison — which, in addition to being expensive, are known to increase the risk of recidivism and result in poor long-term outcomes, such as lost education, reduced job opportunities and compromised health.
Among the most important findings, however, is that agencies within the juvenile justice system could do a better job working together to help the public understand aggregate data about system-involved kids. DJS publishes a vast amount of information once a year about youth in its care. But this agency represents only a portion of the juvenile justice system.
At the very least, data from all of the relevant agencies, including the state’s Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, could be made more compatible. As it is, seemingly interchangeable categories tracked by different agencies — like “arrests,” “complaints,” “charges” and “cases” — mask crucial distinctions that make cross-agency comparisons difficult, if not impossible.
Baltimore’s young people are associated with less than 10% of the city’s crime. Yet when it comes to talk about community safety, our kids are front and center. Making youth justice data more accessible and better understood could keep public opinion from being disproportionately shaped by rumor, algorithms and media headlines about individual incidents. The result could be policy solutions that are better for kids, communities, and limited state budgets alike.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/9349996-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-03 12:11:50.111443

(Photo via Getty Images)Drivers using their phones outside of hands-free or voice-activated modes now face a $100 fine as Iowa’s 2025 distracted driving law goes into full effect.
The measure, signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds in April 2025, expanded Iowa’s previous ban on texting while driving to ban all handheld use of personal electronic devices while driving. Iowa is the 31st state to enact a “hands free” law.
Although the law took effect July 1, law enforcement officers were only able issue warnings throughout 2025. But as of Jan. 1, 2026, drivers are now subject to fines for breaking the law. The baseline fine is $100 for using a phone while texting, increasing to $500 in cases if the incident results in an injury, and to $1,000 in incidents that cause a death.
In a December recording of “Iowa Press,” Larry Grant, state safety planner for the Iowa Department of Transportation, said in 2025, Iowa saw a major reduction in traffic fatalities in comparison to previous years. According to DOT data, there were 260 traffic deaths in 2025 — a total of 97 fewer deaths than in 2024 and a nearly a century low. Public officials say the hands-free law, as well as other factors like people complying with other safety laws by wearing seatbelts or obeying speed limits, have contributed to the state seeing fewer deadly traffic incidents in the past year.

“Now granted, one fatality is too many, and everybody needs to realize that — but we’re we’re down 77 fatalities on average right now,” Grant said at the Dec. 12 recording. “And if you go back for our high in the last five years, we’re down over 100 fatalities. That’s 100 lives that are still here. So that’s just huge when we look at that.”
Other states that have passed similar “hands-free” measures, including Iowa’s neighbors Minnesota and Illinois, have also seen reductions in car crashes and traffic deaths since enacting these restrictions.
Part of the reason fines did not start until 2026 was in an effort to give time for drivers to learn about the new law. Sgt. Alex Dinkla, an Iowa State Patrol spokesperson and Brett Tjepkes, chief of the Governor’s Traffic Safety Bureau, said in December the state and law enforcement officers have made a major push to inform people about the new “hands-free” law through educational materials and distributing pamphlets at rest areas and driver’s licensing stations.
Dinkla said in his experience, most people “probably are aware” of the new law, but that he has still encountered some drivers who do not know about the change.
Many newer cars — and a majority of smartphones — are able to enter hands-free mode to ensure compliance with the law, Dinkla said.
“Something that we had to kind of work through, I think with the public and messaging, is that you don’t have to have a new vehicle with all of the technology involved in it,” he said. “Almost every phone that’s out there will make a hands-free call. You can ask Siri, you can ask Alexa, and or even just a one touch which the law allows for, but it can’t be in your hand.”
The law was signed in 2025 after several years of stalling in the legislative process, despite having strong support from law enforcement and safety advocates as well as from families of victims who died in distracted driving incidents.
“It wasn’t one person that did this,” Dinkla said. “It wasn’t one department that did this. This was a collective effort amongst many folks. You heard stories of people that were involved in texting and driving. They championed trying to get that across the finish line. The Governor’s Traffic Safety Bureau, many other city, county supporters with that. So it was definitely a collective effort.”

Melinda S. Spencer, 35, was also charged with abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence, according to police. It’s unclear how far along her pregnancy was. Kentucky has very few and only narrow exceptions to its abortion ban. 
According to a KSP news release, a medical clinic in Campton contacted state police on Dec. 31 around 2:30 p.m. and reported that “there was a lady in the clinic (who) disclosed that she had aborted her pregnancy at her residence.” 
After police arrived at United Clinic, they said, the woman “stated to detectives that she had ordered medication online to complete an abortion” and “took the medication which resulted in the death of a developed male infant.” 
After that, police said, she “buried the infant on the backside of her property in a shallow grave.” Police say they went to the residence property and “located the infant in a shallow grave.” 
The case is still under investigation. 
Kentucky state law defines first degree fetal homicide as causing  “the death of an unborn child” except when a person “acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse.” The crime  is considered a capital offense in Kentucky. 
The woman’s other charges — abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence are Class D felonies. 
Kentucky state law describes abuse of a corpse as treatment “that would outrage ordinary family sensibilities” and includes burial without proper preparation.

The legislation (SB 1032) by Sen. Alexis Calatayud, R-Miami, also would allow doctors to significantly increase the supply limits that qualified doctors can prescribe to patients. The bill would allow doctors to issue certifications for up to 10 70-day supply limits of smokeable medical marijuana, rather than three. Doctors could also issue up to 20 35-day supply limits instead of the existing six.
The proposal would waive the $75 registration and annual renewal fees to receive a medical marijuana ID card for any military veteran honorably discharged from the U.S. armed forces.
A similar measure (HB 719) was filed in the House last month by Rep. Bill Partington, R-Ormond Beach. His bill would go further by requiring the Florida Department of Health to establish reciprocity agreements allowing patients from other states to qualify for a registration card “within 1 business day.”
Partington’s bill also would allow doctors to recommend medical cannabis via telehealth visits for initial consultations. Existing Florida law allows telehealth visits only when patients have their cards renewed.
There are 929,655 medical marijuana patients in Florida, according to the Office of Medical Marijuana Use. To remain in the program, each patient must renew his or her ID card with the state every 12 months at $75 per clip. They must renew certification by their doctors every 210 days, or approximately seven months from the date the physician certifies. Those fees vary by clinic and location across the state, generally ranging between $100 to $200.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/medical-marijuana-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 16:57:33.483371

That number pales in comparison to the $40 million Republican Byron Donalds’ gubernatorial campaign announced last month.
Jolly is a former Pinellas County Republican U.S. representative who announced his candidacy in early June, and for much of 2025 was the only high-profile Democrat in the race to succeed Ron DeSantis in November 2026.
Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings entered the Democratic race in November. His campaign has yet to announce any fundraising amounts (and did not respond to a request for comment).
“David Jolly is running a campaign focused on listening, not lecturing,” said Campaign Chair Mitchell Berger in a press release. “This fundraising report reflects more than financial strength. It reflects a movement bringing together Democrats, Independents, and Republicans who want solutions, not division.”
The other major Republican candidates for governor are former House Speaker Paul Renner and investment firm CEO James Fishback.
Fundraising reports for Florida political candidates and political committees for the fourth quarter of 2025 are due on Monday, Jan. 12.
There haven’t been many public-opinion polls looking at the 2026 gubernatorial race in Florida, but a University of North Florida Public Opinion Research Lab survey released in late October showed Donalds leading Jolly by 11 percentage points and Demings by 12 points.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-02 16:57:33.483371

The Delaware City Refining Company has appealed a recent state order requiring the rapid installation of real-time fenceline air-monitoring sensors, arguing that the mandate’s 70-day timeline is technically infeasible and risks producing unreliable data rather than meaningful public protection.
On Friday, Dec. 12, 2025, Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Gregory Patterson issued an order directing the refinery to install and operate real-time sensors around the facility to monitor volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, following a butane release in late November that was later determined to have lasted significantly longer than initially reported.
In a statement released this week, the refinery said its engineers evaluated available monitoring technologies and concluded that installing a system capable of reliably meeting DNREC’s specifications within the required timeframe is not feasible. Company officials said they have notified DNREC of those findings and are seeking to amend the order to allow adequate time to select appropriate technology, identify suitable monitoring locations, and establish a realistic installation schedule.
The refinery said it is working cooperatively with DNREC and has formally appealed the order to allow for a compliance plan that balances transparency with technical accuracy.
State’s Rationale for the Order
DNREC issued the expedited order after a release of butane and related VOCs that the refinery initially reported as lasting less than two hours but later acknowledged continued for approximately 19 hours, from Nov. 26 into Nov. 27. While the Delaware Division of Public Health concluded the release posed no immediate or long-term health threat, DNREC said the delayed detection left regulators and the public without real-time information during the incident.
Under the order, the refinery would be required to install fenceline sensors capable of triggering automatic alerts to DNREC and the public when VOC levels exceed set thresholds and to take immediate corrective action if an exceedance is detected. DNREC has noted that PBF Energy, the refinery’s parent company, operates similar systems at facilities in California.
A Broader Debate Over Regulation and Reliability
Supporters of the order say fenceline monitoring would improve transparency and community trust. Critics counter that while such systems can be useful tools, they have limitations: sensors detect only certain pollutants, can generate false positive readings, yet miss releases depending on wind direction, and require careful calibration to avoid false readings.
From a regulatory perspective, refinery officials argue that rushing installation could undermine confidence in the data and distract from the more fundamental goal of improving internal detection and operational awareness.
Economic Stakes for Delaware
The Delaware City Refinery has operated since 1956 and remains a major industrial employer and taxpayer in the region, supporting hundreds of direct jobs and additional work for contractors, trades, and transportation services. At the same time, it has been the focus of repeated environmental enforcement actions and community concern over emissions.
Industry observers warn that overly aggressive or inflexible regulatory timelines can carry unintended consequences. California, often cited as a model for strict environmental policy, has seen 72% of its refineries close in recent years, including two major refineries this month.  This contributes to higher fuel prices, job losses, and increased reliance on imported fuel.
What Comes Next
The Environmental Appeals Board will review the refinery’s appeal while discussions with DNREC continue. Refinery officials say they remain committed to complying with an amended order that achieves the state’s transparency goals without sacrificing technical integrity.
For DNREC, the case is part of a broader enforcement and rulemaking effort, including proposed regulations expected in 2026 that could expand fenceline monitoring requirements statewide.
The outcome of the appeal may set an important precedent for how Delaware balances environmental accountability with economic stability and practical implementation.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dcrc_-_fenceline-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-02 16:57:33.483371

Colin Hackley)A divided Florida Supreme Court ruling this week on assisted reproduction methods raises the prospect of children having three parents — or at least raises a new complication for couples seeking to have kids with outside help.
By a narrow 4-2 margin, the state’s high court on Wednesday concluded that under Florida statute a sperm donor did not automatically relinquish his parental rights because the artificial insemination was done at home instead of at a fertility clinic.
A majority of justices agreed to overturn two lower court decisions that had previously found that Angel Rivera had given up his parental rights when he agreed to provide his sperm to Ashley Brito and Jennifer Salas. 
Brito used an at-home artificial insemination kit. According to court documents, Brito and Salas got married after confirming the pregnancy and began raising the child together. However, they separated a little more than a year later. Soon afterward, Rivera filed a petition seeking recognition as the child’s legal father.
The majority justices stressed that they were not concluding that Rivera is entitled to parental rights. Rather, the opinion focused on whether the governing state law, passed in 1993 and amended in 2020, applies to people who artificially inseminate outside a clinic setting.
Justice Jaime Grosshans, writing for the majority, said the law did not apply to Rivera.
“Taken together, it is clear that this section of newly enacted statutes, as well as the one amended statute, focused almost exclusively on providing a legal framework for gestational surrogacy issues and laboratory-based reproductive procedures — i.e. ART, [assistive reproductive technology],” Grosshans wrote.
Joining Grosshans in the decision were outgoing Justice Charles Canady as well as Justice Jorge Labarga and Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz.
Justice John Couriel, who wrote a dissenting opinion that Justices Meredith Sasso and Renatha Francis concurred with, said the majority “gets that job wrong” and that it was clear that Rivera was clearly a donor whose actions were covered by the law.
And Couriel argued that the court’s decision opens the door to circumstances not authorized by the Legislature.
“But now, the majority authorizes Rivera to become parent number three,” Couriel wrote. “This might be good or bad policy by the Court’s lights, but it is not our law.”
Couriel added, “The Court seems bashful about the full import of its reasoning, stopping one step short of what it knows will be an odd result indeed under Florida law: declaring Rivera a child’s third legal parent. And that is understandable. Whatever hoops Rivera and other donors in his position will have to jump through, so too will people who have relied on their donations as they await the courts’ sorting out of claims that the statute on its face resolves.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Florida-Supreme-Court-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-02 16:57:33.483371

Gov. Phil Scott has appointed two new lawmakers to fill vacancies in the Vermont Legislature days before the start of the session next week. 
John Benson, a managing partner at the engineering firm DuBois & King who currently serves as chair of the Brookfield Selectboard, will fill the vacant Orange County Senate seat left by Republican Larry Hart.  
Val Taylor will replace Rep. Jim Harrison, R-Chittenden, whose Rutland-11 district includes Killington, Chittenden, Mendon and Pittsfield. Harrison decided to step down amid a move to New Hampshire. Taylor previously served as chair of the Mendon Selectboard. 
Both Benson and Taylor are Republicans, according to Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott.
Customarily, the governor chooses a legislative replacement who belongs to the same political party as the resigning lawmaker, picking from a list of candidates submitted by the relevant local political party.
All Vermont legislators are up for reelection this November. In an email, Taylor said she planned to run for the House seat she’s filling. 
She replaces Harrison, who, after almost a decade in office, had risen to vice chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. 
In an email, Taylor said she was excited to work in the Legislature to ensure tax dollars are “well spent.”
In Orange County, Hart stepped down in October, citing the toll the position had taken on his physical and mental health. He was in his first year in the role.  
Benson, Hart’s replacement, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. 
In a statement, Scott praised Benson’s career serving his local community.
“His career as a civil engineer, decades as a volunteer firefighter, and now on the Selectboard, demonstrate his commitment to working together to solve problems, which will be an important perspective to have in the Senate,” Scott said.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Louisiana’s existing six congressional districts will be used for the 2026 midterm election after the U.S. Supreme Court did not rule in a case challenging their boundaries by the end of 2025. 
State lawmakers convened for a special session in October to push back election deadlines one month, with Republicans hoping justices would issue a ruling before the year. Had they made a decision on that timeline, the legislature was expected to hold another special session to redraw the districts, possibly eliminating one or both of Louisiana’s majority-Black seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Instead, the Supreme Court is expected to hand down a ruling during its usual late-spring release period. 
State Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, R-Port Allen, who co-sponsored legislation to change the 2026 election calendar to allow for a new round of redistricting, said in an interview Friday there were no plans to hold another special session or deviate from the existing map. 
Lawmakers can’t create new maps after the Supreme Court’s ruling in the spring because Louisiana is switching to a closed party primary system this year. The switch moved up the qualifying period for candidates from July to February, which created a limited window for redistricting if the decision was issued in late 2025.
The case in question, Louisiana v. Callais, challenges the legality of a second majority-Black U.S. House district Republicans state lawmakers drew in 2024 in response to a federal court finding a 2022 version of the state’s congressional maps was unconstitutional. Louisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, but just one favored a Black candidate before the redistricting process in a state where nearly a third of the population is Black.
The case has since been shaped into a test of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark federal law that prohibits racial discrimination in elections. Section 2 prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. State Attorney General Liz Murrill, who originally defended the 2024 version of the map, now argues race-conscious redistricting under Section 2 is no longer necessary to ensure fair racial representation and now violates the 14th and 15th amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
The Callais case is also notable because justices were originally supposed to rule on the case in spring 2025. But in a rare move, they punted their decision to their next term and called for a second round of oral arguments that were held in October.  The fact that the case had been argued twice gave GOP lawmakers hope a ruling would come earlier than usual. 
Critics of the special session argued Republican legislative leaders would not have authorized the expense of a special session, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in per diem and extra staff time, without the assurance a ruling was coming. 
Kleinpeter and Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, denied this during the session. 
Beaullieu testified during a committee hearing there was no official forecast for when the decision would be issued. He also acknowledged to a reporter the election calendar changes he backed would become pointless if the Supreme Court doesn’t rule in time. 
Qualifying for closed party primaries in the congressional races, scheduled for May 16, will take place Feb. 11-13. Any party runoffs that are needed will be held June 27, and the general election is set for Nov. 3.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bernie Sanders swears in Zohran Mamdani as New York City mayor.","Vermont’s Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders swore in Zohran Mamdani, the new Democratic mayor of New York City, during Mamdani’s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2026 (CBS New York).
Vermont’s Independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders swore in Zohran Mamdani, the new Democratic mayor of New York City, during Mamdani’s inauguration on Thursday.
Mamdani was officially sworn in at midnight New Year’s Day by New York Attorney General Letitia James. But for his public inauguration ceremony later that day, the mayor chose Sanders to administer his oath of office a second time in a ceremonial capacity.
“You showed the world the most important lesson that can be learned today — and that is that when working people stand together, when we don’t let them divide us up, there is nothing we cannot accomplish,” Sanders told Mamdani in a speech before the swearing-in, in front of tens of thousands of people gathered outside New York City Hall.
Both Sanders and Mamdani are self-described Democratic socialists and are at the forefront of national progressive politics. New York’s Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another progressive leader, also spoke at the event. Sanders, who was born in Brooklyn, had endorsed Mamdani’s bid for mayor and campaigned with him last year.
Mamdani has called Sanders “the single most influential political figure in my life.” Sanders told VTDigger last fall that Mamdani’s campaign studied the senator’s 1981 run for Burlington mayor, when Sanders upset a more moderate opponent who’d held elected office for years.
In November’s mayoral election, Mamdani bested former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was running as an independent after Mamdani defeated him and a field of other opponents in a shock victory in the summertime Democratic primary.


In his speech before swearing in Mamdani, Sanders described the mayor’s signature campaign proposals as “not radical,” even as the mayor’s opponents have assailed them as such. Mamdani has called for raising taxes on New York City’s wealthiest residents to fund universal child care and city buses that are faster and fare-free. He also wants to freeze rent increases for millions of tenants in rent-stabilized housing.  
Sanders said Mamdani’s campaign had a seismic impact on national politics “in a moment when people in America, and in fact, throughout the world, are losing faith in democracy.”
“Thank you for inspiring our nation,” he said. “Thank you for giving us, from coast to coast, the hope and the vision that we can create government that works for all — not just the wealthy and the few.
According to the New York Times, Mamdani’s supporters “defied freezing temperatures” and “a fresh coating of snow” to witness the mayor’s inauguration. While Sanders was bundled in a large green coat for the ceremony, he skipped the mittens — sewn by Essex Junction resident Jen Ellis — that he went viral for wearing to former President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021.

The potential sale was announced in October in a news release that said the two companies had “entered into a letter of intent” for Ethema, based in Palm Beach, to acquire the assets and operations of Addiction Recovery Care (ARC). It did not disclose the sale price.
Once the fastest-growing provider of addiction services in Kentucky, ARC has foundered over the past 16 months amid reports of an ongoing FBI investigation into possible health care fraud and closer scrutiny by insurers who process claims for patient care and had begun slashing reimbursement.
Over the past year, ARC has closed multiple facilities and programs and laid off several hundred employees.

More than $100,000 was returned to Montanans in 2025, a press release said. Montana is one of six states that provides restitution assistance to victims of investment fraud. 
“When fraudsters and bad actors harm Montanans, we aggressively investigate them, we fully prosecute them, and we ensure they take a one-way trip to Deer Lodge,” Brown said in a press release. “The most rewarding parts of my job as State Auditor is locking up bad actors and helping Montanans rebuild their lives. There is no better time to do that than this holiday season.”
No general fund money is used in the restitution. Instead, CSI collects money from firms doing investment business in Montana into the Securities Restitution Assistance Fund, a press release said. That fund also includes money collected from those who have violated Montana’s security laws.
State law limits the amount of money victims can receive from that fund and there’s additional restrictions if the fund is “depleted below” $1 million. When laws around victim restitution for securities-related fraud were passed, they were capped at $25,000. 
In 2015 through House Bill 57, restitution was increased to $50,000 for fraud against a victim who is a senior citizen or any other person defined in state law as a “vulnerable person.” That 2015 legislation was run by then-Rep. Moffie Funk, a Helena Democrat, at the request of former state auditor Monica Lindeen.

Their release stated that “currently, a growing number of both Republican and Democratic-led states are stepping up to reform SNAP.”
Some may think the government shouldn’t pay for sugary drinks. I understand that initial reaction. But let’s dig a little deeper.
Elon Musk has received over $38 billion in contracts, subsidies, tax credits and loans from the U.S. government — our tax dollars. Emphasis on subsidies and tax credits.
From 1995 to 2024, South Dakota ranked eighth in the nation for reliance on farm subsidies. Of the $25 billion that came to South Dakota, former Gov. Kristi Noem’s family collected $4.9 million.
Two SD lawmakers join push to ban soda and candy purchases from food assistance program

Meanwhile, some legislators say a single mom of three working two jobs and receiving $109 a month in SNAP benefits shouldn’t be able to buy a diet Coke.
And yes, of course we might wish her cart was filled with fresh fruits and vegetables. But let’s be honest — I hope you’re not judging my shopping list today, either.
What also stood out to me was the claim that “many states are reforming SNAP,” with no detail about how. For example, Michigan’s “Double Up” program allows government food benefits to double in value when healthier choices are made. Studies show that bans will only increase administrative costs and create more stigma around poverty while not making any behavioral changes.
Restricting items doesn’t help families. The path to meaningful assistance is through incentives and support, not punishment. I shared Michigan’s program with Davis, who is my state senator. Perhaps the political optics mattered more than what would actually help her constituents.
This type of legislation helps no one. It adds stigma. It won’t reduce poverty, it won’t improve educational outcomes, and it won’t improve health, because the people being targeted still won’t be able to afford health insurance. But that 99-cent soda? That’s what we’re controlling.
Considering both Davis and Rehfeldt are health care providers and moms, what about legislation to expand free and reduced school lunch, lower health care costs or make women’s health more accessible for rural communities?
We’re angry at the wrong people.
We’re restricting the wrong things.
We’re catering to the wrong individuals.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-02 20:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"How Mississippi could meet the needs of more than 19,000 families waiting for child care vouchers",Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/02/mississippi-child-care-vouchers/,The voucher program has historically only received enough funding to cover 1 in 7 eligible children.,"When she is not caring for her 6-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son, Amaya Jones is working full time at Kroger. Jones wants to go back to school in January to study social work, so she can help young women like herself navigate complicated programs designed to help – but which often trap – poor people. 
“I know what it’s like to be homeless, to apply for (food stamps) and be denied even though you need it, to be looked at as just a number – I know how it all feels,” Jones said. “I want to help mothers and kids and young women.”
Returning to school will only be possible if Jones regains vouchers she lost in June that made child care affordable, she said. 
Jones’ family is one of more than 19,000 Mississippi families who lost access to child care vouchers and is now on a growing waitlist after pandemic-era funding that boosted the program dried up, according to the Mississippi Department of Human Services. 
The extra funding didn’t expand eligibility. The voucher program has historically only received enough funding to cover 1 in 7 eligible children. The additional pandemic funds allowed the program to reach more eligible families – who are now on the hook for hundreds of dollars each month. While thousands of families sit on a waitlist for the voucher, some child care providers are eating the cost and risk closure. 
Mississippi receives nearly $90 million a year from a federal block grant called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. States are allowed to transfer up to 30% of those funds to a separate federal grant, the Child Care and Development Fund, that supports Mississippi’s child care voucher program. In recent years, Mississippi has elected to make this maximum transfer. But states are not prohibited from using the remaining TANF funds on other child care expenses.
This has been the rub between state leaders and child care advocates lately: Advocates want the state to spend more – including some of its $156 million in stockpiled TANF funds – on the child care voucher. But the agency says that’s not doable.
Mark Jones, director of communications at the Mississippi Department of Human Services, said the agency is pursuing other solutions for child care that will become clearer in 2026. 
“Plugging long-term holes with non-recurring funds is not feasible nor responsible,” Mark Jones said about feeding unspent TANF funds into the voucher program. 
Meanwhile, advocates have argued it’s not responsible to be sitting on millions of unspent TANF dollars. 
“Mississippi gets a new TANF grant, $86 million, every year,” said Carol Burnett, director of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, which has been advocating on behalf of child care access for decades. “We rarely spend it all, which is how we ended up with a huge unspent balance in TANF. So, TANF is not one-time money because we get the grant every year and we don’t ever spend it all.”

Mississippi Today spoke to four national TANF experts who weighed in on the situation. They agreed  Mississippi can use more TANF dollars than it is already using toward child care subsidies. The issue can be complicated, but not as much as Mississippi is making it, said Elizabeth Lower-Basch, deputy director for policy for the Center for Law and Social Policy and a national TANF expert. 
“Mississippi is making this harder than it needs to be, I think, is the bottom line,” Lower-Basch said. 
While TANF funds are flexible and can be used on a wide range of services, the system is inherently labyrinthine. Part of that, experts say, is to safeguard against misuse – something Mississippi is well known for. 
“I’m guessing since Mississippi has gotten so much blowback for some of the ways it used TANF in the past, it’s gotten a little gun-shy,” said Lower-Basch.
While Mississippi may not be able to push more than 30% of its TANF funds through a transfer to the Child Care and Development Fund, experts say there are other ways to use TANF to supply more child care vouchers.
Other states have successfully conjoined funding streams so that extra TANF funds can be used on child care vouchers without technically being considered “transferred funds,” explained Stephanie Schmit, director of Child Care and Early Education at the Center for Law and Social Policy. It can sometimes be complicated. 
“States do ‘marry them’ in ways that work well in their state, but states use different mechanisms to make that happen. There’s often memorandums of understanding or contacts,” Schmit said. “… It’s not as straightforward as ‘direct dollars can be spent through the existing system – done.’ It’s layers, and it’s very much dependent on the state.”
The department is going a different route, Mark Jones said. The agency opened a request for proposals for work supports, or programs that help people in low-income jobs to remain employed. Proposals may include child care, along with 11 other areas – such as transportation and job search assistance – according to the department’s application. 
There’s no guarantee the state will select proposals that include child care – or that the eligibility would resolve the current waitlist. But if the winning proposals include child care, the subgrantee would supply child care for the program participants by paying the child care provider directly, Mark Jones explained. 
“In early 2026, once we announce the TANF subgrantees, we will have a clear picture of the future,” he said. 
The child care crisis
Experts have long-considered the state of U.S. child care a crisis. But that’s indicative of a deeper problem: the devaluing of caregiving and early education nationwide. The system doesn’t work for anyone involved, experts say. Parents can’t afford to buy into it, and child care employees can’t afford to work in it. 
The only solution would be to provide public dollars “in a very significant way,” explained Ruth Friedman, who previously directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Child Care during the Biden administration. Except for New Mexico, which recently made child care free for everyone, state and federal governments have been unwilling to make that type of investment, she said.
“Child care is expensive because it’s inherently labor-intensive,” Friedman explained. “Children need adult attention and interactions to be safe and to support their healthy development in child care. But child care programs know parents can’t afford the true cost of care, so the only way they can actually make any profit is to underpay their staff … which just exacerbates the supply problem.”
Friedman worries that H.R.1, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act that U.S. Congress passed in law in July, will worsen the crisis since it shifts hundreds of millions of dollars in health care and food aid costs to states, leaving less room in state budgets for child care. 
Mississippi is already seeing that play out. After the Legislature appropriated a historic $15 million toward child care last year to make a dent in the voucher waitlist, advocates hoped the welfare agency would request the same this year. 
Instead, the Mississippi Department of Human Services Director Bob Anderson asked the Legislature to put $15 million toward SNAP and made no mention of child care. Agency spokesperson Jones said the agency had to make “tough decisions” since about $140 million in food aid costs previously covered by the federal government are now shifting to Mississippi. 
Later, during a December meeting of the Senate Study Group on Women, Children and Families, Anderson said the department would need $60 million to address the child care voucher waitlist – but clarified that he was not asking the Legislature for that money. 
The federal changes to Medicaid and SNAP will also affect how low-income families and child care workers balance their budgets. In Mississippi, more than a third of child care workers rely on Medicaid or food aid to make ends meet. 
“Since the child care workforce relies heavily on Medicaid and SNAP because their jobs pay so little, OBBBA’s massive cuts to the Medicaid and SNAP programs is likely to cause child care workers to leave the profession,” Friedman said. “Of course families’ child care bills will get harder to pay as their own health insurance and food costs rise as a result of the new law.”
Meanwhile, the thousands of eligible families without vouchers are piecing together haphazard child care with family, or going into debt with their child care providers. 
Jones says she’s lucky her mother can care for her children most days, but she worries about the toll it’s taking on their grandmother, who has heart failure. 
“She’s in and out of the hospital, as well,” Jones said. “One day she can be doing fine, the next day she’s not feeling well. If my baby gets sick, I don’t want him to get her sick. It’s extremely scary trying to live this day by day.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09120132/3X0A6593.jpg,,,2026-01-02 15:12:32.883711

(Courtesy)Gov. Mike Braun and Attorney General Todd Rokita want a federal judge to lift a decades-old ban on the placement of a Ten Commandments monument at the Indiana Statehouse grounds.
A motion filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on Tuesday argues that the original legal standard used to block the monument has since been overturned by Supreme Court decisions and that existing law now allows historical displays with religious content.
The case has reemerged amid separate legislative and judicial battles over Ten Commandments displays in other states.
In contention now is an 11,500-pound limestone monument that was donated by the Indiana Limestone Institute in 1996. Then-Indiana Republican Rep. Brent Steele arranged for the donation and placement of the monument, which was intended to be installed near the site of the former Ten Commandments display on the Statehouse lawn, according to court filings.
The attorney general described the top portion of the monument as consisting of a 4-foot, 4-inch tall block of limestone that sits atop a larger rectangular base that is also made of limestone. The Ten Commandments are inscribed on one side of the block and the Bill of Rights are etched on the opposite side.
Smaller sides of the monument contain the preamble to the 1851 Indiana Constitution, as well as a dedication showing the monument was a gift from the limestone institute.
A yearslong battle
A similar Ten Commandments display donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles previously stood on the Statehouse lawn for more than three decades before it was vandalized and removed in 1991.
In 2000, then-Gov. Frank O’Bannon accepted the replacement monument, but the Indiana Civil Liberties Union sued, claiming the monument’s placement on state property would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
A federal judge granted a preliminary injunction later in 2000, concluding that the state’s purpose for erecting the monument was religious, not secular, and that a “reasonable person would … regard it as an explicit endorsement of the Ten Commandments.”
Story continues below.
b977dfd6-2de2-4c1a-8493-8c474a352163
 
The preliminary injunction was later affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and has remained in effect ever since.
In their latest motion, however, Indiana officials contend the original injunction “rests upon legal principles that can no longer be sustained” because the Supreme Court has “discarded the Lemon test” — the 1971 standard that until 2022 guided Establishment Clause analysis.
Rokita additionally said in a news release that the Statehouse grounds “feature many monuments and markers celebrating Indiana’s and America’s heritage.” 
“This monument belongs among them as a reminder of core principles that have guided our nation,” he continued. “After all these years, it’s time to place this historical recognition where Hoosiers and visitors can appreciate its significance in our common story.”
In the same release, Braun added that the monument “reflects foundational texts that have shaped our Nation’s laws, liberties, and civic life for generations.”
“Restoring this historical monument,” the governor said, “is about honoring our heritage and who we are as Hoosiers.”
Rokita further argued in court filings that the state should be able to erect the monument because subsequent U.S. Supreme Court rulings evaluate religious displays based on historical practices rather than the old Lemon standard used. 
The Republican attorney general pointed to the 2005 Van Orden v. Perry case, for example, in which the high court justices allowed a Ten Commandments monument to remain on the Texas State Capitol grounds as part of a broader historical setting.
Opposition — and pending legislation
Civil liberties groups have long been opposed to such a display on state grounds, though. 
In similar disputes, courts across the country have blocked laws requiring Ten Commandments displays in public schools. A federal appeals court ruled in June that a Louisiana law requiring posters of the Ten Commandments in every classroom was unconstitutional under longstanding First Amendment precedent.
And in Texas, a federal judge’s November order forced several school districts to remove classroom posters of the Ten Commandments and concluded that a state law mandating such displays violated the Establishment Clause.
Still, the fight over religious texts in public spaces isn’t limited to the Statehouse lawn.
A new bill pending in the Indiana legislature, authored by Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, seeks to “require each school corporation to place a durable poster or framed picture representing the text of the Ten Commandments in each school library and classroom.”
Davis’ House Bill 1086 has been assigned to the House Education Committee, but it’s not clear whether it will receive a hearing. Similar legislative attempts in the Hoosier legislature have been unsuccessful.
If the federal judge grants Indiana’s motion, the monument could be placed near its originally intended location on the Statehouse grounds. The plaintiffs — which include the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and Americans United for Separation of Church and State — have 14 days to file a response.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-02 19:44:15+00:00,CT Mirror,CT to get $154M through federal rural health grant for 2026,Lisa Hagen and Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/02/ct-to-get-154m-through-federal-rural-health-grant-for-2026/,CT will receive federal assistance to improve health care and access in rural parts of the state ahead of anticipated cuts to Medicaid.,"Connecticut will receive about $154 million in its first tranche of federal assistance to improve health care and access in rural parts of the state ahead of anticipated changes and cuts to Medicaid.
The federal aid comes from the Rural Health Transformation Program, a $50 billion fund that will dole out money to all states over the next five years. The initiative was part of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” amid concerns about how the bill’s Medicaid cuts would affect rural facilities.
Connecticut Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said the award will enable the state “to keep working on long-standing priorities to improve health, prevent disease, and work to achieve our agency’s vision for a Connecticut where everyone is healthy, secure, and thriving.”
“This grant represents a tremendous opportunity to strengthen population health, health care access, workforce capacity, and system sustainability for residents in rural communities across our state,” Barton Reeves stated in emailed comments.
DSS is already hiring for three positions that will be responsible for implementing the Rural Health Transformation Program grant at the state level. 
Over the next five years, half of the $50 billion grant will be evenly divided among all 50 states. The other $25 billion will be based on the sole discretion of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and will take into account the rural makeup of states plus other factors, such as potential for impact.
Connecticut will receive the second-lowest award of all 50 states, just ahead of New Jersey and the smallest award in New England. But it’s possible it will receive more in future yearly allotments.
Every state is slated to get at least $100 million a year through 2030. But stakeholders in Connecticut acknowledged it will be difficult to receive much from the second pot of money at CMS’s discretion, especially since Connecticut is less geographically rural compared to others states.
In a statement this week, CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said “states are stepping forward with bold, creative plans to expand rural access, strengthen their workforces, modernize care and support the communities that keep our nation running. CMS is proud to partner with every state to turn their ideas into lasting improvements for rural families.”
Officials at the Connecticut Department of Social Services and the Office of Policy and Management took the lead on the grant application and worked with several other state agencies. They received input from rural hospitals, federally qualified health centers and others in the health care field.
Following the passage of the “big beautiful bill” over the summer, the rural grant application process was a quick turnaround that opened up in the fall and wrapped up with the awards announcement by the end of the year.
In November, the Department of Social Services requested roughly $938 million from the federal government for the effort. But the state is unlikely to get anywhere near that amount over the next five years of the federal program.
Still, those who helped craft Connecticut’s application for federal assistance are optimistic about the award as well as “working with the state to maximize these funds.”
“Specifically, we are grateful that the state included many of our suggestions in its plan, such as incentives for the recruitment of providers, the development of a rural residency program and funding for technology infrastructure that will improve access to telehealth and remote patient monitoring,” according to a statement from Joanne Borduas, CEO of the Community Health and Wellness Center, which has health centers located in Torrington, North Canaan and Winsted.
“These are all critical to ensuring that our patients in the rural northwest corner of the state can continue to receive the high quality health care they need and deserve.”
Paul Kidwell, senior vice president of policy at the Connecticut Hospital Association, echoed Borduas.
“We believe there is an opportunity for the state to support the implementation of targeted initiatives that both directly invest in rural health care providers and the surrounding hospitals and health systems on which patients living in rural areas depend for care,” Kidwell stated in emailed comments.
Connecticut Senate Republicans similarly praised the news of the funding, saying it will “help bolster recruitment and retention of health care workers, and it will improve and strengthen opioid addiction services.”
Connecticut’s plan included 31 different initiatives focused on increasing care options in rural areas and facilitating access to that care. It included efforts aiming to reduce or eliminate travel times, like rolling out mobile medical and dental vans, as well as expanding telehealth options. There are also programs that seek to improve overall wellness: bringing evidence-based exercise classes to senior centers and making upgrades to existing trail systems.
A handful of the proposed initiatives would require sign-off from state lawmakers, including streamlining the state’s “certificate of need” approval process for major hospital transactions — such as mergers, acquisitions, and unit closures — and seeking a SNAP waiver to bar the purchase of energy drinks and candy.
The funding comes at an uncertain time for many clinics and hospitals as they brace for major health care shakeups in the coming years.
Cutbacks to Medicaid are imminent as a result of the “big beautiful bill.” Rural providers, who see many government-insured individuals, could suffer disproportionately as a result. And if some of those patients fall off the rolls, hospitals expect to treat more people who are uninsured.
Some of those changes to Medicaid could start as early as the end of 2026.
First-time work requirements for the health program could go into effect on Dec. 31. But states may also be eligible for delaying implementation. And by the end of the year, states will need to start redetermining eligibility for Medicaid every six months instead of once a year.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DayKimball_Putnam_YK_file-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-02 14:57:48.536350

Jillian Gilchrest.","Tiffani McGinnis, a West Hartford town councilor and Democratic political organizer, opened a campaign this week to succeed state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, who is running for Congress.
McGinnis is the first candidate to declare for the open seat in the safe Democratic district, and it underscores what Gilchrest has been telling Democrats: Her campaign to qualify for a primary against U.S. Rep. John B. Larson is all or nothing.
“I am running for Congress, and I will not be running for state representative,” Gilchrest said Friday.
McGinnis has made no formal announcement, but she electronically filed her registration as a candidate for General Assembly with the State Elections Enforcement Commission on Tuesday night.
The filing was expected, coming after Gilchrest assured McGinnis that she had no desire for Democrats to put a hold on anyone else seeking the 18th House District seat she won by unseating an incumbent eight years ago. 
“She reached out to me,” Gilchrest said, a gesture she called “very unnecessary.”
McGinnis, 54, is a Tennessee native who had been a political activist for a dozen years before moving to West Hartford a decade ago with her husband and three children.
The last election that McGinnis observed as only a spectator was the 2000 presidential election, which Al Gore lost after the U.S. Supreme Court settled a contentious and close Florida recount in favor George W. Bush.
“I started volunteering in 2004,” McGinnis said Friday.
In 2020, she worked for the election of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as the organizer of New England Women for Biden-Harris. Four years later, she created Gen X for Harris.
Democrats selected her as one of the electors who would cast Connecticut’s seven Electoral College votes in 2024 for Harris, who easily won the state over Donald J. Trump.

She also was active in Connecticut politics, serving as treasurer of Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz’s reelection campaign in 2022, then chairing a political action committee Bysiewicz formed in 2023, Women in Power PAC.
“Occasionally, I would think about running for office,” McGinnis said.
In March 2023, McGinnis was appointed to a vacancy on the West Hartford town council. She was elected to a two-year term in 2023 and reelected in 2025 on a slate of six Democrats that outpolled Republicans by nearly 3-1 margins.
No other Democrat has made a move for Gilchrest’s seat.
“Tiffani is the only person who has reached out to me,” Gilchrest said.
McGinnis’s registration as a candidate is of value to Gilchrest, whose candidacy has not been helped by speculation that she eventually would quit the race for Congress and seek a fifth term representing in the General Assembly.
Gilchrest was elected to the state House as an insurgent, unseating a 12-term incumbent, Andy Fleischmann, in a Democratic primary she won with 53% of the vote in 2018.
It is a template she now is trying to replicate on a larger, more crowded stage: the 27 communities of the 1st Congressional District, which is dominated by Hartford and its suburbs.
Larson, 77, of East Hartford, is facing his first serious challenge since winning the open congressional seat in 1998.

(LRC Public Information) A Republican former legislator has announced he will try to retake a Central Kentucky House seat. 
Killian Timoney, often seen as a moderate and defeated in the 2024 GOP primary, said in a New Year’s Day Facebook post that he will again be a candidate for the 45th House District. He is from Nicholasville. 
“After taking time to listen, reflect, and recharge with my family, I’m more convinced than ever that Kentucky needs experienced, common-sense leadership focused on what matters most: stronger schools, support for working families, and keeping our communities safe and affordable,” he said. 
Timoney, a longtime employee of Fayette County Public Schools, was defeated in the 2024 primary election by Liberty Republican candidate Thomas Jefferson. A key issue among GOP voters at the time was Timoney’s vote against an anti-transgender law affecting medical treatment for youth and public schools. Campaign mailers slammed Timoney for his vote on the issue. 
Adam Moore (Provided by campaign)
Timoney won about 28% of the vote, or 1,072 votes, in the primary. Jefferson was later defeated by the current incumbent, Democratic Rep. Adam Moore, in the general election. Moore took 50.3% of the vote, or 13,030 votes. 
Moore, of Lexington, is the only candidate to formally file with the secretary of state’s office in the 45th House District so far. The filing deadline is Friday, Jan. 9. 
In a statement after filing in November, Moore said he is “determined to keep bringing home results for our communities” and that he planned to focus on health care access, rising energy costs and “advancing common-sense solutions” in the upcoming legislative session.

A spokesperson for the Senate said Miller died from natural causes.
Miller spend more than four decades working for the Legislature in the state capitol.
From 2009 until 2024, she served as Senate Secretary, and took on a temporarily role during last year’s session before fully retiring.
“Marilyn Miller was part of the institution of the legislature,” Senate President Matt Regier said in a statement. “Her gentle strength guided and mentored thousands of lawmakers, staff, and visitors over the decades. Our hearts are with her family and grieve that she is no longer with us, but the Senate is grateful for her service and friendship.”
In 2023, the Legislature officially designated the Senate leadership offices in the capital as “The Marilyn Miller Senate Suite,” and a plaque with her likeness hangs outside the entrance.
According to the plaque, Miller accepted a position as Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives for the 1993 session, after retiring from a 30-year career in state government.

Old-timers might opt for the 21-0 victory over LSU in the 1960 Sugar Bowl. But given the stakes, surely this Sugar Bowl victory 66 years later becomes the biggest ever.","NEW ORLEANS — Notes, quotes and an opinion or two from a Crescent City still buzzing Friday morning from Thursday night’s instant college football classic in the Sugar Bowl:
• Las Vegas oddsmakers have made Miami a three-point favorite over Ole Miss for next Thursday’s Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Arizona. Oddsmakers set the over-under point total at 51.5. Undefeated and top-seeded Indiana is a four-point pick over Oregon in the Peach Bowl.

• Coaches and commentators are always talking and sports writers are forever writing about how crazy college football has become with pay-for-play and the transfer portal. Perhaps the most crazy example might be this: LSU now owes Lane Kiffin half a million dollars because the Ole Miss Rebels have advanced to the semifinals of the College Football Playoffs. Should Ole Miss beat Miami, that total rises to $750,000. If Ole Miss wins it all, Kiffin will make a million. Crazy, no?
• Ole Miss improved to 7-4 all-time in Sugar Bowl appearances, with wins this year and in 2016, 1970, 1963, 1961, 1960 and 1958. Only Alabama, with 10 victories, has won more Sugar Bowls.
• The win over Georgia puts the Rebels’ record at 4-1 against this season’s 12-team College Football Playoffs field. That’s most victories of any team in the tournament.

• All the unusual off-field circumstances (Kiffin leaving, etc.) during this Ole Miss post-season run continue to be regurgitated in the national media. An emotional Ole Miss Chancellor Glenn Boyce, speaking to Yahoo’s Ross Dellenger on the field amid the post-game Ole Miss celebration, tried to put the focus where it belongs.  “It’s incredibly hard to put it in words,”  Boyce said. “The way you hold something like this together is, sure, leadership and leadership matters, but here’s the other way: these players.”
• Biggest football win in Ole Miss history? Old-timers might opt for the 21-0 victory over LSU in the 1960 Sugar Bowl – and it was huge – but given the stakes, surely this Sugar Bowl victory 66 years later becomes the biggest ever.

• Trinidad Chambliss, asked post-game about his pending appeal to the NCAA, said he expects an answer soon. “The NCAA has been closed now, but I’m pretty sure it opens tomorrow, so maybe we’ll get an answer soon,” he said. “I’ve got people working on it. I’m not the one that’s working on it. My job right now is to focus on football and to focus on this team and to focus on being 1-0 in the next game, so that’s my main focus right now.”
• Pete Golding’s signature victory as a head coach came less than an hour’s drive from his hometown of Hammond, Louisiana. “Yeah, it’s definitely special, being 35 miles away,” Golding said. “My brother lives in New Orleans, a bunch of family. A bunch of Hammond High boys here tonight.”

• The Sugar Bowl ended about one hour before college football’s transfer portal opened. Golding, with that in mind, said he has courted junior placekicker Lucas Carneiro in recent days. Carneiro, a transfer from Western Kentucky, is one of the nation’s best placekickers, as he showed in the Sugar Bowl with three long and clutch field goals. “I think a lot of people think Lucas is the best kicker in the country, so a lot of people want Lucas,” Golding said. “So I’ve been meeting with Lucas a lot lately. We’ve had a lot of good meetings here, and especially this week. I got to spend a lot of time with him one-on-one and just getting to know him a little more and figuring out what he wants in the future. … We felt like he was the best kicker in the country coming out of Western Kentucky last year. He’s done an unbelievable job this year.”
• Georgia coach Kirby Smart was gracious in defeat, praising Golding, the Rebels players and even the Ole Miss crowd. Smart said Ole Miss deserved the victory, but added: “I enjoyed that game and that atmosphere. I am proud of our team. I’m sick that we lost, and there’s things I would love to go back and do differently. But I’m just so proud of the way our guys competed when down 10, and just didn’t finish it.”

Ned Lamont wins a third term as governor, he could become the longest-serving governor since Jonathan Trumbull during the Revolutionary War.
But the chances of him outlasting John Winthrop “The Younger,” an early governor of the Connecticut Colony in the 1600s, are slim — it would require a fourth and fifth term (and an amendment to the state Constitution) before Lamont or anyone else could serve longer than Winthrop’s 18 years.
The Connecticut governor who served the shortest time was Hiram Bingham III, a remarkable figure who might have served as inspiration for the fictional Indiana Jones. Bingham was elected simultaneously as governor and to the U.S. Senate. He chose the Senate role, but to ease the transition for his lieutenant governor, Bingham was sworn in as governor of Connecticut on Jan. 7, 1925 (101 years ago Wednesday). He attended the parade and the inaugural ball, then, the next day, he resigned and left for Washington, D.C.
In modern times, the longest-serving Connecticut governor was William A. O’Neill, a Democrat who served for more than 10 years. O’Neill was sworn in on the last day of 1980 after Gov. Ella T. Grasso resigned. He was reelected twice and served until early 1991 after he decided not to seek a third full term.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CTGovs-1024x631.jpg,,,2026-01-02 13:57:24.280575

(Photo: Gaston County Sheriff's Office)Federal law enforcement officials announced Friday that they had foiled a planned attack “in support of ISIS” in Mint Hill, North Carolina, on New Year’s Eve.
According to Russ Ferguson, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, the suspect is 18-year-old Christian Sturdivant, an American citizen and Mint Hill resident.
Ferguson said the man had been in contact with ISIS members in Tiktok chatrooms and “had pledged allegiance to ISIS” while planning a New Year’s Eve terrorist attack on a grocery store and a fast-food restaurant in Mint Hill.
“He started reading ISIS material, started going to ISIS websites, making Tiktok videos, and eventually reached out to what he thought was a member of ISIS. In reality, it was an undercover agent with NYPD in New York,” Ferguson said. “He was preparing for jihad, and innocent people were going to die, and we were very, very fortunate they did not.” 
Ferguson said Sturdivant intended to use knives and hammers and planned to wear a Kevlar vest, but also planned to die in the attack. He was under surveillance for two weeks before his arrest on New Year’s Eve, Ferguson said. “At no time was the public in harm’s way.”
James Barnacle, the FBI special agent in charge of the Charlotte field office, said Sturdivant had been under psychological care in recent years. He said Sturdivant’s grandfather had stopped him from attacking neighbors when the suspect was 14.
“His family actively hid knives and weapons from him,” Barnacle said.
Barnacle said the FBI had been watching Sturdivant during that period in 2022, but stopped its investigation when the teen entered mental health treatment.
But last month, when Sturdivant turned 18, Barnacle said, he resumed trying to contact members of ISIS and was immediately flagged by a number of law enforcement agencies.
Barnacle said Sturdivant was seen as a credible threat. “He wrote a manifest. He stole two hammers out of the storage shed and hid them in his house. He reached out to an undercover agent and requested guns.”
Ferguson said the FBI first tried to have Sturdivant involuntarily committed, but a state magistrate denied the petition. So they obtained a warrant and arrested him for “providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization,” a charge that can carry a prison sentence of 20 years.
Sturdivant is currently being held without bail in the Gaston County jail. No attorney or public defender was listed for him at midday Friday. The case will be prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Gleason for the Western District of North Carolina and DOJ Trial Attorney Elisa Poteat with the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Justice.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GetImage.jpeg,,,2026-01-02 13:57:24.280575

(Photo via Google Earth)A southeast Iowa hospital where a long-term care resident died after being put to bed while struggling to breathe is now facing a potential $10,000 fine.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing has proposed a $10,000 fine against the 165-bed skilled-nursing facility at West Burlington’s Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center, known as The Klein Center. That fine is being held in suspension while the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determines whether a federal penalty will be imposed in place of the proposed state fine.
According to state inspectors, the staff at the Klein Center failed to perform a proper assessment and failed to intervene when a female resident with Down syndrome coughed, choked and vomited during the evening meal on Dec. 5, 2025.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Inspectors reported that a certified nurse aide alleged that as she and a licensed practical nurse sat talking near the dining area, a male resident of the facility approached them, reported that a female resident was choking and coughing, and asked the nurse to check on her. According to the CNA, the nurse said, “OK,” but didn’t follow up.
About 10 minutes later, the CNA allegedly told inspectors, another resident of the facility approached the nurse and said a woman in the dining area was choking, had turned red in the face and had vomited.
At that point, the nurse checked on the woman, determined she was choking, and encouraged her to spit out any sputum before assisting her from the dining area to her room. Once in her room, the woman “continued to cough with copious amounts of sputum coming up,” inspectors reported, and was unable to take drinks of water or swallow.
‘Maybe this will help’
The CNA reportedly told inspectors that although the woman appeared to be struggling to breathe, the nurse left the room, then returned with the woman’s evening medications. The nurse “placed the pills in (the woman’s) mouth and gave her some water, but (the woman) continued to cough and gag, eventually spitting out” the pills, the CNA reportedly told inspectors.
The state inspectors reported that the nurse then instructed the woman to lie down in bed, with her head elevated, and placed the woman’s CPAP, or Continuous Positive Air Pressure, mask in place, saying, “Maybe this will help.”
According to inspectors, the CNA later told them she “questioned in her head whether it was a good idea putting the woman in bed when she was still coughing but dismissed it since the LPN was the charge nurse.”
Later in the evening, a certified nurse aide noted the woman was pale, had labored breathing, and had thrown up in her CPAP mask. Two nurses were called to the resident’s bedside where they noted the woman’s oxygen levels – which are considered dangerous when they fall below 92% — had dropped to 34% and the woman was no longer responsive.
The staff called 911, but pronounced the woman dead a short time later.
Inspectors reported that when they asked the licensed practical nurse whether she had performed any patient assessments after the choking episode — such as checking the woman’s lung sounds, vital signs and oxygen levels — the nurse “teared up and stated, ‘No.’”
Resident abuse cited in May 2025
In May 2025, Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center’s Klein Center was fined $500 by the state for resident abuse. In that case, a CNA had reportedly confronted a male resident of the home who had expressed concerns about the welfare of a fellow resident.
The CNA allegedly told the male resident not to worry about the other residents and “sit your f—ing ass down.” A worker also reported hearing the CNA call the male resident a “b—-” while asserting that she knew “how to do my f—ing job.” The employee told inspectors the CNA had called a different resident a “b—–” many times and was generally very vulgar to the residents.
A second employee reportedly told inspectors the CNA once gave a shower to a female resident who complained the water was too hot, prompting the CNA to tell her “shut the f— up.” The employee who reported the matter said the resident was crying afterward and asking why the CNA was mean to her.
In all, three staff members told inspectors they were aware of the CNA’s verbal abuse of residents but didn’t report it, in part because they had to work with her regularly.
Federal records indicate that during the past three years, Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center’s Klein Center has been fined once by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The facility has a three-star, or average, overall rating from CMS.

Kansans for Life, an organization opposed to abortion rights, says KDHE ought to have released the report long ago. In this 2023 image, Stanek attends a legislative hearing. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The number of abortions performed in Kansas during 2024 surpassed 19,000 for the second consecutive year in wake of judicial and political decisions in other states restricting access to the medical procedure.
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported clinics and hospitals in Kansas conducted a record 19,811 abortions in 2024, up from 19,467 in 2023, 12,319 in 2022 and 7,849 in 2021. Of the 2024 total, 4,763 were provided to residents of Kansas. Demand for abortion among Kansans increased 9.3% from 4,356 in 2023 and was above the 3,844 reported in 2022 and 3,937 in 2021.
In 2024, 15,048 abortions in Kansas were provided to out-of-state residents. That was a slight decline from the 15,111 nonresident abortions in 2023 and a significant increase from 8,475 in 2022 and 3,912 in 2021 among people living outside Kansas.
Three-fourths of abortions in Kansas the past two years were for patients residing in other states, primarily Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma. Here was a state-by-state breakdown in terms of Kansas abortions in 2024 for nonresidents: Texas, 6,736; Missouri, 3,760; Oklahoma, 3,141; Arkansas, 851; Louisiana, 206; and Nebraska, 138.
In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide for nearly 50 years. Reversing that precedent returned authority to prohibit or regulate the procedure to individual states.
The Kansas Supreme Court had issued a decision in 2019 that found the Kansas Constitution guaranteed individuals bodily autonomy in health care decisions, including a woman’s right to end a pregnancy. The state court’s decision preserved abortion rights in Kansas after the U.S. Supreme Court severed federal constitutional protections.
In Missouri, abortion was legal only in cases of medical emergency from 2022 to 2024. However, Missouri voters in 2024 approved a constitutional amendment restoring broader reproductive freedoms. Other states in the Midwest responded to the U.S. Supreme Court by imposing bans on abortion, including Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. Oklahoma has allowed abortions only to preserve the life of a pregnant person. Nebraska enforces a 12-week abortion ban.
Mackenzie Ayers, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion organization Kansans for Life, said the state health department should have more promptly released information on 2024 abortions in Kansas. The state’s latest report was posted online at the end of December 2025 as part of a larger annual summary of vital statistics on Kansas.

“By waiting until the final hours of the year to release Kansas’ 2024 abortion statistics, Gov. Laura Kelly has made it clear she hoped these numbers would go unnoticed,” Ayers said.

Ayers said Kansans for Life believed young females were obtaining abortions in Kansas without parental consent. She said the organization would be “pursuing every legal option to restore some form of informed consent protections for women in 2026 and continue to sound the alarms about parental consent laws being potentially ignored.”

Janet Stanek, secretary of the state Department of Health and Environment, said the latest annual report provided an overview of information on the health status of Kansans.
“Public health statistics are essential to governmental agencies, businesses, industries and citizens for effective health policy decisions and program planning. KDHE is committed to ensuring accessibility,” Stanek’s report said.


KDHE’s report said 85.8% of all abortions performed in the state during 2024 were for unmarried women. KDHE said 77.1% of Kansas resident abortions in 2024 occurred prior to nine weeks of gestational age. Nearly 93% were prior to the 13th week of gestation and 2.8% came after 16 weeks gestation, the state health department said.
KDHE said there 140.3 abortions per 1,000 live births among Kansas residents in 2024. That was 9.6% higher than the ratio of 128 abortions per 1,000 live births in 2023.
The highest abortion ratio among Kansans residents on 2024 was for females 15 to 19 years of age, who had a rate of 341.9 abortions for every 1,000 live births. The lowest ratio — 80.4 abortions per 1,000 births — was for women 30 to 34 years of age, KDHE said. There was variation among Black, white and Hispanic women. The ratios: white non-Hispanics, 85 abortions per 1,000 live births; Black non-Hispanics, 402 abortions per 1,000 births; and Hispanics, 211.6 abortions per 1,000 births.

During 2024, KDHE said, there were 33,956 live births to residents of Kansas for a rate of 11.4 per 1,000 people. The agency said that was the lowest Kansas birth rate since 1912. The rate in 2024 represented a decline of 0.2% from 34,041 births in 2023. Here was the age breakdown of these Kansas mothers: under age 20, 4.5%; 20 to 29 years of age, 51.2%; 30 to 39 year of age, 41.5%; and aged 40 and over, 2.8%;

KDHE reported Kansas residents had 2,656 low-birth-weight infants, representing 7.8% of total births, in 2024.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Following the Trump administration’s last-minute invocation of an energy “emergency” to order a Colorado coal plant to postpone its scheduled retirement, the electricity provider that co-owns the plant is warning that the high costs of continuing to operate it will be shouldered by Colorado utility customers.
Located in Moffat County, Craig Generating Station’s 446-megawatt Unit 1 had been scheduled to go offline on Dec. 31, 2025, part of a wave of coal retirements planned across Colorado through 2030. But an emergency order issued Dec. 30 by the Department of Energy requires the plant to “take all measures necessary to ensure that Craig Unit 1 is available to operate” until at least March 30, 2026.
Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, co-owner of Craig Generating Station, said in a press release that the “additional investments in operations, repairs, maintenance and, potentially, fuel supply” required by the order will raise costs for the plant’s customers, which include dozens of electric utilities and rural co-ops. Unit 1 was already offline due to a mechanical failure on Dec. 19, Tri-State said.

“We are continuing to review the order to determine what this means for Craig Station employees and operations, and the financial impacts,” said Tri-State CEO Duane Highley. “As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region. There is not a clear path for doing so, but we will continue to evaluate our options.”
The five-page DOE order, signed by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, cites “growing resource adequacy concerns” as justification for the move, which followed similar actions in Indiana and Washington.
Shortly after taking office last year, President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency” in an executive order blasted by environmental advocates as a pretext for advancing the interests of fossil-fuel companies. Despite the declaration’s stated concerns about “insufficient energy production,” the administration has continued to cancel and delay major wind and solar projects.
An analysis released in December by the Sierra Club estimated that keeping Craig’s Unit 1 open for 90 days would cost ratepayers at least $20 million. Critics of the administration anticipate that the DOE’s orders will continue to be renewed every 90 days under the authority granted to the department by Federal Power Act, raising costs by $85 million to $150 million annually.
“Keeping this dirty and outdated coal plant online will harm the health of surrounding communities and hurt all of our pocketbooks,” said Michael Hiatt of environmental group Earthjustice. “This unlawful order will benefit no one but the struggling coal industry.”
The DOE order comes amid a series of Trump administration actions targeting Colorado that are widely viewed as retaliation for the ongoing incarceration of Trump ally and former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who was convicted on felony charges for her role in a breach of her own office’s secure election equipment in 2021.
Colorado U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet voted to confirm Wright, a former Denver oil executive, as Trump’s pick for Energy Secretary in January 2025, calling Wright “passionate about strengthening America’s energy independence and lowering costs for Colorado families.” In a statement Wednesday, Bennet, a Democrat who is running for Colorado governor, said he was “disappointed but not surprised by this continued revenge tour.”
“The DOE order is the latest in a string of attacks against Colorado, because we refuse to bend to the President,” Bennet said. “President Trump continues to take out his personal and political grievances on Coloradans who are already struggling to make ends meet.”

Mike Braun ceremonially signs legislation in his Statehouse office on Wednesday, May 28, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun has re-established a board overseeing the state’s workforce training programs just months after a similar board was dissolved.
Braun signed an executive order saying the State Workforce Development Board was needed to comply with federal law on the implementation of state and federal workforce initiatives.
The governor’s office said the board would serve “as a central coordinating body to align employers, education and training providers, and state agencies around measurable workforce outcomes.”
Braun’s order released Monday comes after the 21-member Governor’s Workforce Cabinet was eliminated as of July 1. The Workforce Cabinet was enacted in 2018 at the request of then-Gov. Eric Holcomb.
The state budget bill approved by the General Assembly last year repealed the Workforce Cabinet from state law and transferred its activities to the state Department of Workforce Development.
Braun has not yet named members to the board or specified its makeup.
The order said Braun will be a board member and that the governor will appoint other members from those nominated by Indiana business organizations, trade associations and labor unions. Board members must include officials responsible for state workforce programs and from local government.
“We will use the Indiana Workforce Development Board to bring together an elite team of job creators and workforce development experts to help create new opportunities and bigger paychecks for Hoosier workers,” Braun said in a governor’s office statement.
The workforce board’s reinstatement follows a renewed push by some Republican lawmakers to reduce Indiana’s roster of more than 250 state boards and commissions.

According to the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals, Jerome Miller, who has practiced mental health counseling in Des Moines, was issued a three-year temporary license in August 2022.
The board alleges it fielded complaints alleging Miller’s conduct was unprofessional and demonstrated a failure to maintain professional boundaries with a client.

According to the board, in July 2024, Miller disclosed personal information about himself to a client, which the client stated made them feel uncomfortable. Miller also hugged the client, the board alleged, telling the client they gave “good hugs.” The board says the client also alleged Miller made other inappropriate comments, undisclosed by the board, which Miller denied.
The board charged Miller with engaging in unethical conduct, including, but not limited to, improper sexual contact with a client or making suggestive or improper remarks to a client.
The case was resolved with a settlement in which Miller agreed to accept a warning that any future misconduct could result in additional discipline.
Miller, whose license has expired, also agreed to complete six hours of board-approved education in area of professional boundaries, plus six hours of board-approved education in the area of professionalism.

The comment[...],"(Photo by Getty Images)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and local advocates are defending Ohio’s child care system after comments from the Trump administration accusing another state of child care fraud.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said states would need to provide “justification” proving that federal child care funds are being spent on “legitimate” entities. The comments followed fraud allegations in Minnesota related to the state’s child care programs, stemming from a YouTube video by a right-wing social media influencer. The allegations particularly targeted child care centers run by Somali citizens of the state.
The allegations led the Trump administration to freeze federal funding going to the child care sector in Minnesota, which owners and Democrats in the state said would cause major problems in an already struggling sector.
While DeWine said “people are rightfully concerned” about the Minnesota child care fraud allegations, he defended Ohio’s nearly 5,200 state-funded facilities.
In a recent statement, the governor said with the sheer number of facilities “there is certainly the potential for fraud,” but Ohio has several ways of countering the threat.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
He noted the practice of paying facilities based on attendance instead of enrollment, a new provision inserted into the state’s most recent operating budget.
DeWine also said the Ohio Department of Children and Youth has a system in place verify attendance and review childcare programs, along with investigating allegations of fraud.
“The department has a comprehensive review process of child care programs that receive state dollars that includes a review of family eligibility, unannounced health and safety inspections, and financial management reviews,” DeWine said in a statement.
Advocacy groups in the state said the child care system in Ohio certainly has room for improvement, and faces struggles based on cost and accessibility, but the threat of fraud isn’t on the list of widespread problems.
“Ohio has strict child care regulations and inspections,” said Tami Lunan, who leads The CEO Project, which focuses its advocacy on parents, child care providers, teachers, and women of color who work in what the group calls the “care economy.”
Lunan said delaying or freezing funding to providers “would be a disaster” because of the already thin margins under which child care centers operate.
“Ohio’s child care providers, many of whom are small business owners, women, and people of color, operate under constant scrutiny and accountability while serving working-class families who rely on stable, affordable care,” Lunan said in a statement.
“Suggesting otherwise without evidence is dangerous and inappropriate to the providers who are doing essential work and following the law.”
In a Jan. 1 press release, the think tank Policy Matters Ohio said lawmakers need to address workforce shortages, low wages, high costs and other issues, rather than focusing on “misleading claims” about child care.
The organization furthered DeWine’s and other advocates’ statements that Ohio’s system includes strict oversight and “crucial accountability measures.”
“Ohio already has strong systems in place to protect children and taxpayers,” Policy Matters senior project coordinator and child care researcher Ali Smith said.
“Licensed child care providers undergo routine, thorough, unannounced inspections every year, and those reports are available for anyone to review. Suggesting that oversight is lax is simply not true.”
Citing data from the Ohio Department of Children and Youth, Policy Matters said the department received 124 fraud allegations in 2025, and 61 of those resulted in overpayments being paid back to the state. A dozen programs were closed by the Department of Children and Youth in that year.
“This is how accountability and transparent oversight are supposed to work,” Policy Matters stated in its release.
DeWine noted this data as well, adding that 30 other programs accused of fraud were “operating in accordance with state and federal laws,” and 21 are still being reviewed.
Smith encouraged caution for families seeing “unsubstantiated claims of fraud” on social media or elsewhere, citing examples of viral videos that were taken during holiday breaks when facilities were closed.
“We urge Ohioans to rely on official sources, rather than social media speculation,” Smith said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-02 17:06:52+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT DMV raises towing rates, but tow companies say it’s not enough",Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/02/ct-dmv-towing-rates-increase/,"Towing companies argue the fees won't cover their ""true costs,"" but their ask would have more than doubled the consumers' cost, a report said.","Despite pleas from tow truck company owners for a larger hike in towing rates, a hearing officer for the state Department of Motor Vehicles has approved a 13.5% increase spread over the next three years.
The new rate aligns with a DMV attorney’s recommendation at a public hearing in October before attorney Steven Baron, a per diem contractor hired by the state. Several towing companies appeared at that hearing seeking significantly larger increases from the current $125 rate.
But in an eight-page decision released in December,  Baron said the rate for a nonconsensual tow of a vehicle under 10,000 pounds would increase to $130.63 in 2026 and then go up to $136.51 in 2027 and $142.65 in 2028. Almost all nonconsensual private property trespass tows would be covered under this rate increase. It does not include police-ordered tows.
“It’s too low. I don’t consider it a fair increase,” said Timothy Vibert, president of the Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut.
“It’s basically a cost of living increase and nothing else,” Vibert said.
In approving the DMV’s recommendation, Baron rejected towing companies’ proposal to adopt Maryland’s towing fees which he said “could more than double the cost for the consumer.”
Michael Festa, owner of MyHoopty of Watertown and president of the Association of Connecticut Towers, said in a statement that “the increase falls short of addressing the true cost of compliance, insurance, labor, and regulatory burden faced by licensed towers.”
“Private property towing is no longer a simple service — it is a heavily regulated public function,” Festa said. “Rate relief must reflect that reality, or the system becomes unsustainable.”
Baron also agreed with the  DMV’s recommendation not to raise the storage rate fees for towed vehicles. The rate for vehicles under 20 feet long is $30 if stored inside and $26 if stored outside for the first five days. Rates then increase to $37 and $31, respectively.
At the October hearing DMV attorney David Cardone said the agency did not support an increase in storage rates because it would directly impact the consumer.
“Since the cost of the nonconsensual trespass tow is borne by the consumer, an increase in storage rates may have the greatest  impact on a segment of the population that can least afford to absorb an increase,” Cardone said
In his analysis, Baron noted the towing rate increase mirrors the growth of the Consumer Price index over the past two years. The new rates included several new fees that were part of a legislative overhaul of the state’s more than 100-year-old towing regulations last session.
Legislators passed the new law after a series of stories by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica revealed that towing companies could seek permission from the DMV to sell someone’s vehicle after 15 days, one of the shortest time periods in the country. 
The series highlighted how towing companies doing private property or trespass tows were affecting low-income residents who in many cases couldn’t afford the fees to get their cars back.
One of the new charges implemented because of the new legislation is a $50 drop fee as proposed by the DMV. Cardone said towing companies previously were not required to release the vehicle should someone arrive on scene when it was being “hooked up,” but under the new law they must release it.
There is also a new after-hours redemption fee of $50 to cover labor costs. The new statute requires tow companies to be available at all times with proper notice to allow someone to get their car back, especially on weekends. The new fee would cover the costs of an employee having to go to the tow yard to release the vehicle.
Baron did approve a $1 increase per mile in mileage charges to tow vehicles back to their lots — bumping it to $6.65 a mile. The new statute only allows towing companies to charge for a maximum of 13 miles, capping mileage costs at $86.45 under the new plan.
The new rates also removed a fuel surcharge that towing companies were getting if diesel fuel was over $3.50 a gallon. They were allowed to bill customers for fuel, but Baron eliminated that from the new regulations.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2275-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-02 12:13:16.912679

Investing in public schools is ... investing in Mississippi's people.""","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

Whether you call it “school choice” or vouchers, privatization of education socializes all the costs of education, but privatizes all the benefits.
So under “school choice,” all Mississippi taxpayers will pay for wealthy kids to go to private schools, even though those private schools won’t accept all Mississippi taxpayers’ children as students.
If “school choice” keeps being pushed on Mississippi taxpayers, we will continue to be saddled with an even greater financial burden that doesn’t benefit the majority of Mississippi families nor Mississippi communities. In fact, it actively harms most families, businesses and communities because it starves the public schools, which are the only schools responsible for educating every child who walks through their doors.
We will all end up paying even more for education and getting far less in return because private schools are private for a reason – because they don’t want the responsibility nor the accountability of educating all children. Most private schools are set up to educate a select few and the select few does not include poor children, children with special needs and children who don’t speak English.
Educating all children well and equitably comes with a cost. With public schools, taxpayers not only share the costs, they also reap all the benefits that come with a well-educated citizenry.
I don’t know of any private school that wants to accept the responsibility and accountability of educating all children in their community, but they would gladly accept the generous gift of Mississippi taxpayer money to continue educating a select handful of already-enrolled private school students.

Folks already using private schools would benefit above all others in Mississippi. Where “school choice”/vouchers have passed in other states, we’ve seen private schools increase their tuition once vouchers are available because they know which families can still afford it and it keeps out students that most private schools would rather not serve.
Mississippi legislators have rarely kept their promise to Mississippi taxpayers, families and communities to be responsible stewards of our public schools. Every time the state Legislature breaks its promise to the people who elected them, they increase the financial burden of their own local communities. The Mississippi Legislature ties the hands of the local community by telling them how much they can tax at the local level and what that money can and can’t be used for.
Plus, many of our communities are at or near the maximum percentage they can tax at the local level. And whether they are at or near that maximum local tax percentage allowed by the Legislature, the vast majority of Mississippi communities don’t have the economic capacity to make up for – at the local level – the amount of financial support they’re supposed to be getting from the State. 
“School choice” is a lie built on a false promise. Mississippi has tried vouchers or “school choice” before, and the only people who could receive them were people who had the same skin color as me. Mississippi, like some other Southern states, used vouchers to prop up segregation. Vouchers weren’t intended to be available for all children then, and they won’t be this time either.
“School choice” doesn’t just hurt individual children or families or communities. “School choice” will hurt our cost of living, our overall quality of life, our state’s economic capacity to succeed and, ultimately, the cornerstone of our representative democracy. 
Public education is an American value. Investing in public schools is not only investing in Mississippi’s people, it’s also the most common sense approach to strengthening our economy not only at the state level, but also at the levels of our local communities, families and individuals.
Mississippi would be wise to elect legislators and congressional representatives who are committed to strengthening the single most important factor to improving every community’s capacity to succeed economically – America’s public schools.

This story was first published by WyoFile on Dec. 18, 2025.
The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population continues to stagnate geographically, a relatively new trend that wildlife managers say is related to bears saturating “suitable habitat” where the species is tolerated.
That finding is described in a new and first-ever rangewide report summarizing where grizzly bears are found in the Lower 48.
Overall, grizzlies, which are classified as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, continued their decades-long recovery and reoccupied 4% more habitat over the past two years. That equates to a rangewide expansion of roughly 2,250 square miles, or an area about two-thirds the size of Yellowstone National Park.

But bruins that dwell in the tri-state Yellowstone area were the exception. The estimated 1,050 grizzlies there occupied about 3.5% less ground, or about 963 fewer square miles, than they did two years ago. The report does not address what drove the change, but lead author and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks research biologist Cecily Costello said it’s likely related to grizzlies running out of ideal habitat in the modern West.
“When you look at the habitat to the east of the Yellowstone Ecosystem, to the south of Yellowstone, you’re looking at a lot of open prairie,” Costello said. “There’s not really big river valleys those bears could move into. There’s a little bit of a limitation in terms of the range expansion in those directions.”
Wyoming grizzly managers see it similarly, attributing the slight retreat to bears losing spaces where they can live without getting into trouble.
“I think it’s just indicative of where the population is,” said Dan Thompson, large carnivore supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “I don’t think we should expect it to expand.”
The occupied grizzly bear range in the Yellowstone region is retreating slightly and encompasses an estimated 26,100 square miles, nearly two thirds of which is located in Wyoming. (Map courtesy of Cecily Costello)
Matt Gould, the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team’s new leader, agreed. His predecessor, Frank van Manen, predicted about a decade ago that the grizzly population in the Yellowstone region would soon stabilize — and now it seems to be doing just that.
“Occupied range has kind of waned up, and now it’s kind of slightly decreasing,” Gould said. “It’ll be interesting to see: ‘Does it drastically drop, or is it going to stay steady and bounce around?’”

Range for grizzlies stopped expanding
Biologists first documented the end of a half-century-long era of grizzly range expansion in the Yellowstone area two years ago. At the time, federal scientists observed a 0.5% reduction in the species’ overall distribution — a retreat of 142 square miles.
The mapping Costello and her co-authors just completed examined the period from 2010 to 2024. Distribution in the Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide ecosystem is based on hard data — from tracked bears, conflicts and other verified observations — over a 15-year rolling window.
The data is smoothed out based on the whereabouts of all grizzlies known to exist in any given area. For that reason, bears that make “outlier” movements, like the subadult male that reached the Bighorns in 2024, don’t usually influence the distribution maps.

Contraction in the Yellowstone Ecosystem’s occupied range comes at a time when there has been a record number of bears dying, though grizzly biologists say they don’t necessarily see the two trends as being related.
Mortality hit a high in 2024, with 72 known grizzlies that died that calendar year, Gould said. The death toll in 2025 is almost the same, at 71, which is about 35% greater than the 10-year average of 54 mortalities. (Editor’s note: Following publication of this story, Gould confirmed an additional death with the Daily Montanan, which put the count at 72 for 2025.) 
The leading causes of death, according to Gould, were livestock conflict (21 grizzlies killed as a result), followed by “site conflicts with humans” (16 grizzlies), self-defense killings (12 grizzlies), accidental deaths (nine grizzlies) and natural causes like predation (six grizzlies).
In 2025, three in four Yellowstone-area grizzly deaths were within a zone in the core of the ecosystem known as the “demographic monitoring area.” That’s a slightly higher rate than average.
Where grizzly bear habitats are retreating
Wildlife managers count bears in the demographic monitoring area. This area was declared fully occupied by bears in 2019.
In Costello’s distribution report, this “core” area represented 71% of where grizzlies were found in 2024. The other 29% of the occupied range fell outside of this core area on the fringes of the mountainous, public land-dominated ecosystem. This is where grizzly range has been retreating. When Yellowstone ecosystem grizzly distribution reached its peak in 2021, more than 40% of occupied range was mapped outside the core zone.
In 2024, the largest contraction in occupied Yellowstone habitat was located in eastern Idaho in the Big Hole Mountains and Snake River Range. Another recession appears in Montana’s Ruby Range, maps from the report show, and there’s a small loss of occupied range in the South Pass area off the tip of the Wyoming River Range.
Costello, who compiled the maps, said she doesn’t put a “whole lot of stock” into small regional changes.
“The edges are a little bit uncertain,” she said, “because you have less [grizzly data] about the edges than you do about the middle.”
The other major population of grizzly bears in the Lower 48 dwell in Montana’s Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. Occupied grizzly range stretched by 2,500 square miles, a nearly 12% increase. These bears mostly pressed into new habitat on the eastern and southern sides of the ecosystem, gaining ground in the Sapphire Range, and Boulder and Big Belt Mountains, maps show.
There are more than 24,000 square miles of occupied grizzly bear range in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, a 12% increase from an assessment two years ago. (Map courtesy of Cecily Costello)
The Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem’s occupied range encompasses much more open prairie than to the south in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
Partly, that’s explained by Montana grizzlies moving down big river corridors, Costello said. When a bunch of them make the movement, the occupied range line can “pull out really quickly.” Smoothing of the data can then make it look like they’ve reoccupied big chunks of open country, she said.
Habitat is another explanation for why western Montana occupied grizzly range keeps stretching while Yellowstone-area bears have held steady and retreated in places.
“When you look at the plant communities and mountains that exist in western Montana, there’s still a lot of what could be considered decent bear habitat,” Costello said. “It’s the expectation that we’ll probably continue to see bears moving into those habitats.”
A lot of that growth is expected to take grizzly populations toward Idaho’s Bitterroot Ecosystem, which has been unoccupied since the species was wiped out there in the 1950s.

In 2020, the Board of Nursing charged Mandi Irlbeck of Harlan with excessive use of alcohol that might impair a licensee’s ability to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety. The board alleged that in May 2020, Irlbeck came to work in a condition unfit to work. The board did not disclose the nature or place of her employment.
In additional, the board said it received information that Irlbeck “excessively uses alcohol.”
In a settlement, Irlbeck agreed to have her license placed on probation for 18 months, during which she would not use alcohol and would enroll in a chemical screening program.
In July 2025, the board received a complaint that Irlbeck’s coworkers suspected she had been intoxicated while working as a nurse. While looking into that matter, the board learned Irlbeck had failed to report a 2024 conviction for drunken driving during a period when she worked at a MercyOne medical facility.
The board also learned Irlbeck was then facing a charge of second-offense drunken driving that was still working its way through the courts. That charge stemmed from a May 2025 incident in which Irlbeck was pulled over near Logan and, according to police, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.235% — almost three times the legal limit for driving.
Court records show Irlbeck subsequently pleaded guilty to the second-offense drunken driving charge and, according to the board, she was fired from her place of employment due to concerns with her use of alcohol.
The Board of Nursing charged Irlbeck with being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the nursing profession, and with engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum.
The board and Irlbeck recently agreed to a settlement that calls for Irlbeck to accept a warning that states any future infractions may result in some form of discipline. As part of the settlement, Irlbeck also agreed to enroll in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program. Her nursing license remains in full effect.



Board takes action in other nursing cases
Other Iowa-licensed nurses whose cases recently came before the Board of Nursing include:
Melynda Albert of Muscatine — The board alleges that while Albert was working in a Bettendorf assisted living facility in April 2023, she was suspected of taking a vial of morphine from a resident’s supply. Court records indicate the theft occurred at The Summit, a residential care facility in Bettendorf, and that the victim was a dying hospice patient.
Albert was criminally charged with unlawful possession of a prescription drug, possession of a controlled substance and fifth-degree theft. She later pleaded guilty to the possession charge and the two remaining charges were dismissed and was placed on probation.
In December 2023, Albert was criminally charged with theft, and later convicted, for stealing items at a Walmart store.
In August 2024, she was charged with violating the terms of her probation in the morphine-theft case by failing to complete a substance-abuse evaluation as ordered. In December 2024, she was cited for driving with an open container of alcohol in the car.
In April 2025, District Associate Judge Michael Motto ruled Albert had successfully completed the terms of her probation in the morphine-theft case and ordered that all charges in the matter be expunged from the public court record — although those records remain accessible to the public.
Board of Nursing documents indicate the panel filed a set of disciplinary charges against Albert in June 2025, although the written charging documents in the case have not been publicly disclosed. As part of a recent settlement agreement with the board, Albert has agreed to an indefinite suspension of her license that will remain in effect until the completion of a substance-abuse evaluation that indicates it is safe for Albert to practice, at which point her license will be placed on probation for one year.
Jaclyn Zabolotny of St. Cloud, Minn. — In May 2025, Zabolotny applied for an Iowa license to work as a registered nurse. Board records indicate that on her application she reported a criminal history and an out-of-state disciplinary case. An investigation showed that in May 2017, while working as a licensed nurse in Minnesota, Zabolotny was charged with felony possession of a controlled substance procured by fraud or deceit. She later pleaded guilty to the charge and successfully completed probation in 2019, after which her criminal conviction was expunged.
According to board records, Zabolotny admitted she obtained a prescription for an opiate using the credentials of a nurse practitioner so she could get some sleep and keep working the 60 to 90 hours per week she was scheduled. According to the board, Zabolotny “regrets this decision and knows it was wrong.”  Noting that Zabolotny has completed a substance abuse evaluation, recommended educational courses, and mental health counseling, and has maintained an unconditional nursing license in Minnesota since February 2021, the Iowa board agreed to issue her a license free and clear of any restrictions.
Angela Gaynor of Sioux City — Board records indicate Gaynor’s Iowa license to practice nursing expired in 2018. In February 2025, she applied for license reactivation and disclosed a 2019 criminal conviction for felony credit card fraud, which resulted in a deferred judgment and three years of probation. In October 2020, Gaynor entered a guilty plea to a charge of violating her probation by testing positive for THC and alcohol.
In January 2022, she stipulated to a second probation violation resulting from her refusal to enter a residential treatment program. In January 2023, Gaynor was successfully discharged from probation. In deciding to grant Gaynor’s request for a reactivated Iowa license, subject to two years of probationary status, the Board of Nursing noted Gaynor “was forthcoming regarding her criminal history and drug use,” and that she had been sober for 15 years before suffering a relapse.
Nikki Smith of Waterloo — Board records indicate Smith applied for licensure in November 2024. A board review of her criminal history showed a conviction for first-offense drunken driving in July 2020, violation of a no-contact order in October 2022, a second-offense drunken driving charge in May 2024, and domestic-abuse assault by display or use of a weapon in May 2024. Smith subsequently completed a substance-abuse evaluation, a domestic abuse program and a drinking driver’s class, according to the board. Noting that Smith was “forthcoming regarding her criminal history” and that “she took full responsibility for her mistakes,” the board agreed to issue Smith a license, subject to one year of probationary status.
Ursella M. Washington of Perry — The Board of Nursing has charged Washington with committing an act that might adversely affect the physical or psychosocial welfare of a patient; failing to assess, accurately document, evaluate, or report the status of a patient, and failing to respond to a board investigation or subpoena. The board has not disclosed any information as to the alleged conduct that gave rise to the charges or when it may have occurred. A disciplinary hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 23, 2026. Although the charges were only recently made public, state records indicate they were approved by the board on Sept. 8, 2025.
