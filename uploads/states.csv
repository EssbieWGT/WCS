Joe Pizarchik knows mining.
For nearly a decade, he served as the Senate-confirmed head of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), the federal agency charged with regulating the surface impacts of underground coal mining across the country.
Before that, Pizarchik served in his home state of Pennsylvania in its Department of Environmental Protection, first as assistant director of the Bureau of Regulatory Counsel, then as director of the Bureau of Mining and Reclamation.

Pizarchik said that in all that time, he’s never seen a situation quite as disheartening as the one the nation is experiencing under President Donald Trump.
In an interview with Inside Climate News, Pizarchik spoke at length about the current regulatory environment around coal mining and, more specifically, about a recent announcement in Alabama. The state’s top coal regulator has suspended federally mandated methane monitoring after a March 2024 home explosion atop a coal mine that left an Alabama grandfather dead and his grandson severely injured.
“It is extremely disappointing to see a Trump regime putting the interests of big corporations and wealthy people ahead of American citizens and the environment,” he said.


So far in his second term, President Donald Trump has emphasized his administration’s support for what he calls “clean, beautiful coal,” which is actually the dirtiest, and often most expensive, of fossil fuels.
The administration has also trumpeted the fast-tracking of coal projects across the country, claiming that doing so will “unleash American energy.” Often, however, that characterization doesn’t hold water. In Alabama, for example, where the Bureau of Land Management has just approved mining thousands of acres of publicly owned coal, part of what may be the largest mining expansion in state history, none of the extracted coal will be used to power American homes. Instead, the metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, will virtually all be shipped overseas through the port of Mobile, Alabama, for use in foreign manufacturing.
Pizarchik said that he’s particularly concerned about the ability of federal agencies like OSMRE to enforce regulations required by law during a government shutdown.
Even when Pizarchik was head of the regulator and a government shutdown wasn’t at hand, he said, it was difficult for the agency to meet its goal of inspecting 10 percent of all mines. Now, under the current regulatory environment, Pizarchik said that’s even further out of reach.
“It’s highly unlikely that’s happening at this point,” he said.
Pizarchik is also deeply troubled by the actions state like Alabama, where regulators have moved to push back against what he views as common-sense enforcement of federal law to protect citizens from imminent threats.
In March 2024, a home exploded above Oak Grove mine, a longwall coal mining operation in rural Jefferson County, southwest of Birmingham. The explosion, likely caused by the release of methane gas, which is released during the mining process, led to the death of W.M. Griffice, a grandfather, and severely injured his grandson.

In December 2024, following an extensive investigation by Inside Climate News, federal regulators at OSMRE issued a “Ten-Day Notice” indicating that the mine might have been out of compliance for failing to adequately monitor potentially explosive methane emissions. The notice required Alabama regulators to come into compliance or “show cause” for any failure to seek adequate remedies.
In response, state officials required coal companies across Alabama to submit methane-monitoring plans within 90 days to mitigate risks posed by escaping gas. Before the 90 days were up, and at the request of the coal industry, the director of Alabama’s coal regulator, Kathy Love of the Alabama Surface Mining Commission, issued a six-month extension.
Officials from OSMRE pushed back, writing to Love that they felt the extension was “excessively long” and that the agency likely would not have abated its Ten-Day Notice had they known she planned such a delay.
In September, as that extension was about to expire, Love sent a letter to OSMRE notifying federal regulators that she had indefinitely suspended any requirements to monitor methane gases above coal mines, even where homes and businesses are present. Love also asked federal regulators for a formal review of the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the Ten-Day Notice, which she said she believes should be “withdrawn.”

Pizarchik said he’s never heard of a state agency approaching federal regulators months after a Ten-Day Notice to ask that it be withdrawn. If Love had issues with the agency’s actions, he said, they should have been expressed to federal regulators months ago.
“If Alabama and this director thought there was no merit to it, she had ten days to put together the evidence and demonstrate that,” he said. “She didn’t do that, which I think raises questions about her credibility.”
Love declined to answer Inside Climate News’ questions about the letter and Pizarchik’s observations. “No comment,” the director said in an e-mail.
Pizarchik also said that the timing of Love’s letter may be opportunistic, sent at a time when OSMRE’s regulatory staff is stifled by the government shutdown and in the shadow of the Senate’s confirmation of Lanny Erdos, a former coal executive, as the new head of OSMRE.
“This letter’s timing might have been tied to the impending shutdown and with the change in leadership,” he said.
Love’s letter also came just weeks after the Bureau of Land Management approved a private company’s mining of federal coal in Alabama, partly based on the expectation that Alabama would soon have methane monitoring requirements above mines.
That expansion of Warrior Met’s Blue Creek mining facilities is slated to be one of the largest buildouts of coal mining infrastructure in the state’s history, with capital costs topping $1 billion. Taxpayer-funded support for the project, which included the controversial deepening of Mobile Bay to support exporting mined coal, may exceed $400 million.
“That could definitely be another timing factor,” Pizarchik said. “Wait until that project is finalized and then suspend the monitoring program so the coal companies don’t have to do it.”

Pizarchik also said that he doesn’t buy Love’s contention that the technology doesn’t exist to conduct such monitoring and that doing so would be cost prohibitive for coal operators.
“It’s a crock of bull,” Pizarchik said. “Longwall mines are the most efficient in the country. So they ought to be able to afford that.”
Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill even lowered costs for coal mines, he said, reducing royalties on mining publicly owned coal and providing a tax break for metallurgical coal operations.
And the technology to monitor methane, Pizarchik said, already exists. Anyone can go into a Lowe’s or Home Depot and buy a basic methane detector, similar to a fire alarm, to provide protection. There are also basic steps mining operators can take to reduce the risk of methane escaping into residences or other confined spaces.
“You simply vent the methane into the atmosphere,” Pizarchik said. “And that’s not particularly expensive.”
Pizarchik also noted that Love’s letter unnecessarily criticizes a citizen who complained directly to federal officials following the home explosion. Love wrote that OSMRE’s regulatory actions may have been based on “media pressure and a citizen’s unknowledgeable complaint.”

Pizarchik said that preventing citizens from providing relevant information to federal regulators would violate the law. During the first Trump presidency, the administration moved to change federal rules to prevent direct citizen complaints, but that decision was ultimately reversed in the wake of lawsuits by environmental groups and, ultimately, Biden’s election, Pizarchik said.
“She appears to want to go back to the rules the way Trump had changed them last time—and that would make them not in compliance with federal law,” he said. “And she’s making a bold assumption about whether that citizen was knowledgeable or not, because the fact is, we know methane got into her neighbor’s home and killed a man.”
Ultimately, Pizarchik said Love’s suspension of methane monitoring increases the risk to residents living above coal mines, particularly “gassy” mines where significant amounts of potentially explosive methane gas are released during mining.
Love and her agency’s actions may bring into question whether the government, and potentially even Love personally, Pizarchik said, may be liable if another tragedy like the March 2024 explosion were to occur again:
“Given the six-month extension and now the permanent suspension, has she not created the circumstances for government liability in Alabama, in her official capacity and maybe in her personal capacity, if someone else is injured or killed from a methane explosion?”
If he were still director, Pizarchik said he would likely take a multi-prong approach to dealing with Alabama regulators. First, he would reissue the Ten-Day Notice requiring immediate action to mitigate the risks of methane escaping from mines. Then, he would begin the lengthy process of a federal takeover of Alabama’s mining regulatory program.
“I think I’d probably do both at this point,” he said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota legislative leader predicted he can “almost assure” that “every legislator” will support reforms addressing inmate rehabilitation and recidivism during the legislative session that begins in January.
Sioux Falls Republican Rep. Greg Jamison, a House majority whip, made the comment as a legislative committee examining recidivism rates held a meeting Wednesday in Sioux Falls. Recidivism is the term applied to inmates who commit more crimes after being released from prison.
Jamison is also a member of a new task force taking up the issue, appointed by the governor and dedicated to rehabilitation transformations in the system.

Both groups came out of lawmakers’ disillusionment with the state’s rehabilitation efforts during discussions about the need for a new men’s prison. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden promised to form the task force in exchange for support for the $650 million project in Sioux Falls, which he and lawmakers approved during a special legislative session in September.
The legislative committee will finalize its list of recommended legislation at its next meeting, targeting rehabilitation, diversion and supervision issues that affect incarceration and recidivism rates. Diversion of nonviolent felony suspects into rehabilitative programming, sentencing reform, more support for inmates reentering society, and addressing why parolees return to prison are all pieces that could impact South Dakota’s incarceration and recidivism rates, lawmakers on both groups said.
The new task force intends to look at rehabilitation throughout the remainder of 2025 and 2026. Task force chair and Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said the task force will focus on short-term and long-term rehabilitation efforts happening with inmates while in prison.
Representatives with the Council of State Governments Justice Center spoke to lawmakers about helping improve rehabilitation efforts based on data from South Dakota and other states. The nonprofit worked with several other states to study and suggest criminal justice and prison reforms.
The nonprofit is already partnering with the state Department of Corrections through next spring to shore up the data tracking offenders who reenter South Dakota communities and better understand outcomes of inmates after they are released from prison. The task force voted to explore working with the nonprofit on Wednesday.

“We’ve struggled to kind of chart our path and goals and now our time is up,” Jamison said, “but this next committee, really, is going to have another window of time to evaluate and lay out a timetable and goals.”
A majority of inmates stay in the prison system for a year or less before being released. Ryan Brunner, senior policy adviser for the governor, said that timeline can limit the rehabilitation programs available to inmates. Upon admission, about 91% of male inmates and 97% of female inmates last year were diagnosed with a substance use disorder.
The task force plans to dive more deeply into rehabilitation options and community partnerships connected to programming for education, faith, tribal and behavioral health needs. Venhuizen said the group will likely meet again in December.

Three hearts
Harper Grant, 15, Chelsea
Octopuses have three hearts. I’ve been told that I do too. Is it the way I look at you or the way I listen? Is it how I place my hand on your shoulder or how I smile? I don’t think I try to hide myself the way an octopus does, and I certainly don’t have the tentacles to show off. But everything about the octopus seems familiar. 
The skin that changes color at will to help them hide. They’ll bury themselves in the sand just to be safe. That has to be uncomfortable, right? I’m sure they don’t exactly like it, but there are dangers around. The octopus is as much prey as it is predator, and their flexibility is both a blessing and a curse. Great for getting around and hiding out, but so easily breakable it’s funny. How much of me is in that skin?
The eyes that watch their surroundings for prey. Looking for the perfect chance to strike while hidden under a rock. How long do they wait just to eat? The ocean is littered with fish, shrimp and crabs for them to eat, but how many tries does it take just for one bite? That has to be exhausting, spending all day waiting to replenish the energy spent on waiting. When do they even have time to sleep? With those eyes that always watch for a chance that they may not even take. How much of me is in those eyes?
And of course, those three hearts. Two pump blood to the gills to pick up oxygen, and the other
takes that blood and spreads it to the rest of the body. When an octopus swims, its third heart stops. Is that why they crawl? Even if they’re slower crawling, they can’t live a life of swimming. They’ll die. So they crawl, at the price of slowness. At least it won’t be their own fault if harm comes to them. At least they can say they were careful.
So, I guess I have to ask now. How much of me is in those hearts?

That changes as early as Monday, Nov 3, when voters across the state should start receiving a notice in a white envelope with yellow markings and an “Official Election Mail” decal. 
The enclosed letter asks recipients to review the information on their voter record and update any inaccurate or outdated information online at vote.ri.gov or by mail using the form on the back of the letter.
Reviewing and responding to the mailing will help ensure the accuracy of Rhode Island’s voter list and that voters are eligible to vote in the 2026 elections, according to the office of Secretary of State Gregg M. Amore.
If voters receive a letter addressed to someone who does not live at their address, they are asked to write “Not at this address” above the address on the envelope and return the envelope to their mail carrier. 
State and local election officials receive voter list maintenance information from several agencies, including the Division of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Health, and the U.S. Postal Service’s National Change of Address program. 
A voter’s registration becomes inactive when a piece of official elections mail is returned to the sender as “undeliverable.” If an inactive voter does not cast a ballot in one of the next two federal elections, their voter registration can be removed from the voter list, according to federal and state law.
Election officials have removed 107,738 voters from the state’s voter list through these voter list maintenance processes since Amore took office in January 2023.
Voters who need assistance updating their record can call the Department of State Elections Division at (401) 222-2340 or their local Board of Canvassers’ office. For more information on the mailing and a list of frequently asked questions, visit sos.ri.gov/mailing.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-02 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Private schools would take public fund vouchers, but  not with strings attached",Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/02/private-schools-would-take-public-fund-vouchers-but-not-with-strings-attached/,"Private schools have been relatively quiet on  vouchers, though they say now they would take public funds if they did not have to follow the same rules as public schools.","During a recent meeting of the special Mississippi House committee studying school choice, private schools made it clear that they would not participate in any voucher program that required them to follow the same rules as public schools.
An official told legislators the private schools would not submit their students to state assessment tests and would not require their schools to have open enrollment.
When asked about a possible middle ground, Barrett Donahoe, executive director of the Mid-South Association of Independent Schools, replied, “I don’t think we have to compromise anything. I think our schools do a good job.”
The private schools’ refusal to bend on certain issues should not be a surprise to legislators. While House Speaker Jason White, House Ways and Means Chairman Trey Lamar of Senatobia, Gov. Tate Reeves and advocates have touted the need for and advantages of vouchers, the private schools historically have been relatively quiet on the issue, though they do say now they would take the public money as long as they did not have to follow some of the rules adhered to by public schools.
But in recent years, as late as 2024, private schools embraced state tax credits being used to benefit them instead of direct taxpayer payments through vouchers.
They reasoned there would be less oversight with tax credits.
The Mid-South Association of Independent Schools said in a paper titled “The ABCs of School Choice” that tax credits with revenue going to private schools were considered more advantageous to them than vouchers.
“Freedom advocates, instead, look for policies like tuition tax credits and tax credits for donations to scholarship funds, to free up resources so that parents and donors can fund their own choices,” said the paper found on the MAIS website in 2024. “Such policies expand choice for parents without shifting the burden for their children onto others.”
The paper, which no longer is available on the private school association’s website, in part reads, “School choice cannot exist without driving up taxes – or cutting other parts of the budget to avoid deficits. As of 2019, private schools educated 44,000 students in Mississippi. If the Legislature approved a $7,000 voucher for each of those children, it must come up with $308 million more dollars in tax revenue – plus the increased bureaucratic costs (and other costs) associated with administering the program.” 
The state currently offers limited tax credits to private schools through a program dubbed the Children’s Promise Act. The program allows a person or business to make a donation to one of the private schools certified by the Department of Revenue and receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for up to 50% of the donor’s state tax liability or a credit on local property taxes.
In simple terms, the donors to private schools get to pay less in either state income taxes or local property taxes.
The maximum a private school currently can receive through the program is $405,000 annually. Because of the popularity of the program with the private schools, there have been unsuccessful efforts in recent years, led by White and Lamar, to expand the Children’s Promise Act. It is currently capped at $9 million per year in tax credits.
To qualify to receive the benefits of the tax credits, a school must provide services to at least one student with “a chronic illness or physical, intellectual, developmental or emotional disability” or be eligible for the free lunch program or be a foster child.
The Department of Revenue, which oversees the program, has said it does not know how many students who fit into the Children Promise Act categories are educated by each school. Yes, theoretically, it could be only one.
While Lamar, the primary legislative advocate of the Children’s Promise Act, has sought unsuccessfully to increase the amount of the tax credits, he has not made any effort to increase the oversight of the program.
Some have argued that the tax credits do not put a strain on the state budget because money from state coffers does not go out to the private schools.
The argument seems disingenuous since people who donate to the private schools can have their tax liability cut in half, thus reducing the amount of money going into the state general fund.
Reducing the amount of state revenue available, as the tax credits do, accomplishes the same goal as vouchers – decreasing the amount of money available for public schools, health care, law enforcement and other services the state is expected to provide.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/06124141/3X0A2527-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-02 07:16:39.011769

“This is the best place in the world to train,” says Jessie Diggins, a gold, silver and bronze medalist and member of the SMS T2 elite cross-country team capping its offseason in Vermont.

STRATTON — After winning Olympic gold, silver and bronze medals and, just last winter, her third cross-country season World Cup, Jessie Diggins could be forgiven for lazing away the summer and fall on vacation. So why has the most decorated U.S. Nordic skier in history instead run, biked, roller-skied and weightlifted the past six months in Vermont?
“This is the best place in the world to train,” the 34-year-old said recently atop Stratton Mountain as she pointed to steep trails and a nearby gym. “There’s everything you need.”
Diggins isn’t alone in her assessment. She’s one of a half-dozen athletes — including fellow U.S. Olympians Julia Kern and Ben Ogden, Canadian colleague Rémi Drolet and U.S. development team members Fin Bailey and Jack Lange — capping their offseason in the Green Mountain State as part of the SMS T2 elite cross-country team.
The team — formed in 2012 by Stratton Mountain School and the T2 Foundation, a nonprofit that’s now part of the World Cup Dreams Foundation — trains annually from May to the start of racing in November.
“We’re getting prepped all the ways you can when you don’t have snow underneath your feet,” said head coach Colin Rodgers, a former Middlebury College ski team captain and recent U.S. Ski & Snowboard coach of the year. “This place has a tradition and track record that’s probably unmatched anywhere else.”
Or at least in the “lower 48” United States. Diggins, Kern and Ogden just scored three of the seven top “A” slots on the 2025-26 U.S. cross country ski team (which also includes “B” racer Jack Young of the Craftsbury Outdoor Center’s Green Racing Project). Alaska Pacific University’s elite team snagged another three “A” positions, while a Mainer training in Norway took the final spot.
Sverre Caldwell, a retired four-decade Stratton Mountain School coach, has been there from the beginning.

“I remember talking with a couple of people about starting this,” said Caldwell, now 70.
Those “couple of people” weren’t random folk. Take Caldwell: A 2013 inductee into the Vermont Ski & Snowboard Hall of Fame, he’s the father of 2014 and 2018 Olympian Sophie Caldwell and the son of 1952 Olympian John Caldwell — the latter who literally wrote the book on cross-country skiing in a trailblazing 1964 guide the Boston Globe calls “the bible of the sport.”
Another team founder: Caldwell’s friend and fellow Vermonter Bill Koch, the first American to win an Olympic Nordic medal, in 1976, and U.S. flag bearer at the 1992 Winter Games. Koch, 70, remembers when offseason training was limited to cycling the back roads of his childhood Windham County.
“We weren’t pricking our fingers and taking blood samples — that’s all new to me,” Koch said of today’s physical and physiological performance testing. “We know a lot more now than we did then.”
So much so, Diggins devoted an entire chapter of her recent memoir “Brave Enough” to her Stratton workout.
“We hike, swim, gravel bike, run … this incredible mix of different things,” she said in an interview. “You’re trying to train as hard and as much as you can, but not stepping over into injury or burnout.”
“I think of it as stacking bricks,” Diggins continued. “Every day that you work out you add another, and then the weeks build into a really strong base, an incredible fortress of fitness.”
Diggins elaborated on the regimen on comedian Paula Poundstone’s podcast.

“Roller skis,” the Olympian told the host, “are kind of like speedy death traps because they don’t have brakes.”
Diggins said she can wheel more than 50 miles an hour, spurring Poundstone to wonder if everyone on the team was still standing.
“We’ve lost the ability to have a knee-modeling career or an elbow-modeling career,” the skier replied, “but other than that, we’ve lost nobody.”
Instead, all are somebodies. Kern, named to the U.S. cross-country ski team at 17, is now a 28-year-old two-time World Championship medalist.
“I wanted to train with the best,” Kern said of her arrival at Stratton a decade ago.
Ogden, for his part, is the son of two other of those founding “couple of people,” John and Andrea Ogden of nearby Landgrove. But the 25-year-old University of Vermont graduate earned his place on the team as a two-time NCAA national champion and winner of the World Cup’s 2023 Green Bib for fastest male skier under age 23.
“I’ve been coming up to Stratton since I was a kid,” he said.
The team works out six days a week, then kicks back on Mondays.

“There are certain times you need to train really, really hard, but there also are times when you need to be recovering,” Rodgers said. “Your body’s only able to absorb the training if you give it proper rest.”
The team took side trips this summer and fall to Olympic venues in Lake Placid, New York, and Park City, Utah. Diggins and Kern also flew to the Snow Farm cross-country ski area in New Zealand.
“Although we can replicate training on roller-skis,” Kern said, “nothing beats being on snow.”
Then again, working out amid green grass and flaming foliage has its benefits.
“You just feel really supported by this close-knit community,” Diggins said.
In appreciation, the team gathered more than 100 local Bill Koch Youth Ski League students at the base of Stratton Mountain in August for a question-and-answer session.
“What’s your favorite glitter color?” one girl asked Diggins, who often bedazzles her face.
“One time I got to glitter Ben’s mustache for a team relay,” she said of Ogden, “and that was a combo of blue and red.”
The team is wrapping up its training before the start of international racing Nov. 28 in Finland, the 2026 Olympics Feb. 6-22 in Italy and the first-ever World Cup cross-country finals in the United States March 20-22 in Lake Placid.
But while at Stratton, members are focused less on the future than on the present.
“The process of being fit enough to try to win the race is the fun part, and you have to really love and enjoy all that goes into that,” Diggins said. “The race is like the cherry on top.”

It didn’t take much to make the Kirchner trails more accessible — mostly widening bridges and removing some rocks — but there’s a massive payout as people of all ages and abilities can now enjoy them.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Oct. 30, 2025.
Riding trails in Kirchner Woods on Taber Hill Road Thursday morning, Louis Arevalo noticed the smell of rain-soaked cedars and decaying leaves melting into the ground.
Long a locals’ hangout for lunch rides and dog walks, these trails just became a lot more accessible through minimal upgrades. Arevalo is an adaptive rider from Essex who rides a recumbent, hand-powered bike. He’s known for tackling terrain some able-bodied riders would shake their heads at, but today he’s taking flow laps with his dog Ozul, smelling cedars and leaves and giving feedback to Stowe’s trail ambassadors about the upgrades.
“I can ride more advanced terrain,” Arevalo said. “But it’s nice to have gentle terrain for everybody to either learn on or just play together on.”
It didn’t take much to make the Kirchner trails more accessible — mostly widening bridges and removing some rocks — but there’s a massive payout as people of all ages and abilities can now enjoy them. Arevalo especially likes how the trails still feel natural, with roots and non-threatening rocks making the ride interesting, but not necessarily technical.
“The number one question we received about this project was, ‘Is this going to become another Cady Hill?’ And the answer is, ‘No,’” Caroline Loeb, stewardship director with the Stowe Land Trust, said. “We’re not smoothing trails in the same way. Cady Hill serves a very different purpose. The goal here is to keep the rugged natural beauty while providing better access.”
According to Kenzie Brunner, executive director of the Stowe Trails Partnership, Stowe has some of the best accessible riding terrain in Vermont — and she would know. In her prior role with the Vermont Mountain Bike Association, she traveled the state taking inventories of these types of trails.
Since the formation of the Trail Accessibility Hub through the Vermont Trails and Greenways Council in 2023, which dispersed $600,000 in Vermont to assess and upgrade as many trails as possible, towns like Stowe have been expanding their accessible terrain to the point where some zones no longer distinguish between an accessible and non-accessible trail.
Kirchner Woods is the latest trail network in Stowe to receive this treatment. Charlie’s Bypass and Eagle Ridge in Cady Hill have seen the biggest changes, and Stowe Trails is currently planning another beginner and adaptive-friendly trail behind Stowe Village Inn.
For Staub, Brunner and Tom Rogers, executive director of the Stowe Land Trust, the Kirchner project highlights the potential of local partnerships.
The Land Trust owns Kirchner Woods, and according to Staub, the group identified its trails for accessibility upgrades years ago. Acting as a conduit to state funds, the Land Trust contracted Stowe Trails to perform the upgrades. Nicole Corriveau, an AmeriCorps member whose time with the land trust ended this year, worked closely with Stowe Trails on construction. There were even a handful of successful volunteer trail days.
Riding is only permitted on trails in the bottom half of Kirchner Woods, but the area is still a hotbed of activity for hollow residents and visitors alike.
“It’s beautiful in there,” Jeff Alexander said. He works with Vermont Adaptive Ski and Sports and helped Stowe Trails assess the changes that needed to be made in Kirchner.
Like many old mountain bike trails in Stowe, the system in Kirchner was built decades ago by former resident Hardy Avery. They’re beloved trails, Brunner said, and they haven’t changed that much.
“Recreation is such a well-loved and well-engrained thing in the state,” Staub said. “And we’re saying, like, ‘We’ve already done some of the work of making these places public and putting the trails in,’ but they’re not serving everybody. So how can we all collectively change that? I think it’s an across-the-board phenomenon.”

Seeing the falls
The Mill Trail to Bingham Falls is also getting an accessibility makeover. Owned by the Stowe Land Trust, the trail is short and not intended for mountain biking, but it’s extremely popular and dangerous for some people.
According to Rogers, Stowe Mountain Rescue, of which he is a member, responds to Bingham Falls seven or eight times a season. From a Google Maps perspective, it’s just a short jaunt from Route 100 to the majestic crashing falls, but the trail is steep with several hazards.
The calls are mostly non-emergent — lots of twisted ankles and busted legs — but some are more complex, with people trying to navigate areas where “they could really hurt themselves,” Rogers said.
Stowe Land Trust is midway through an accessibility project in the area. So far, they’ve replaced culverts with bridges and removed dangerous hazards. Rogers said the motivation is twofold — to improve flood resiliency and create a universally accessible trail.
“It’s just such a beautiful falls and a lot of people want to see it,” Rogers said. “Our goal is to open up the outdoors and nature, especially in some of these really high-profile beautiful spots, to people of all abilities.”

“It is so much more people-management than policy,” Kristine Lott said.

Mona Abou a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
WINOOSKI — At her last city council meeting on Sept. 15, Kristine Lott closed out six years as Winooski’s first female mayor. Lott stepped down before the end of her term to start a family, and she reflected on the time she spent as mayor and the lessons she would carry forward. 
“It is so much more people-management than policy,” she said. “So much relationship building and communication to try to get these things to come together and move. It’s public service, but it is really people’s service before anything else.”
“I mean, it’s exciting to be the first breaking a barrier,” Lott said of her election in 2019. 
A week after being sworn in, Lott was thrown into the deep end: her first city council meeting as mayor included a vote on a $23 million bond for the city’s Main Street Project. The moment marked the start of a steep learning curve. 
“I didn’t say anything the whole time,” Lott recalled.  She said the experience was very intimidating, but she was determined to ask questions and learn quickly. 
In an interview after Lott’s final city council meeting, Interim Mayor Thomas Renner said he always admired “Mayor Lott’s attention to detail and the way that she is able to see the big picture and also the future picture of what we’re discussing at the moment.”

“I really want to make sure I uphold Mayor Lott’s legacy and continue the work that she’s been doing,” Renner said. 
Renner is breaking barriers as well. He is the first black man and first openly gay man to be mayor. “I’m excited to be able to bring some diversity to the job as well,” he said.
Just over a year into her term, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, giving Lott a challenge that would define her mayorship. “‘What am I doing?’” she remembered thinking. “I am in a leadership role. I don’t know what to do in this scenario.” 
During those first months, Lott leaned on staff and council members to help her steady the city through an unpredictable and challenging time. Lott said the Black Lives Matter movement in particular “made racial disparities come to a head.”

“The way that COVID information was being shared initially was not getting to a lot of our BIPOC and New American community members,” she said.
Winooski is among the most diverse cities in the state and one of Vermont’s only majority-minority school districts. Lott said she always felt a responsibility to reach across the community and make sure that as many voices as possible were heard and a part of the conversation. 
“As a white person representing this most diverse city, I knew that I had to do work to make sure I was engaging with other racial backgrounds,” she said. “It takes intentional work.”
That intention was clear during Lott’s time in office, said City Manager Elaine Wang. “Kristine was a really great partner,” Wang said. “She had a very even-handed approach, always listening to all perspectives before deciding on a direction.”

Some of Lott’s proudest moments came not from policy but from the bonds she built. Among them are her relationships with the members of Winooski’s Islamic community, which began with a simple introduction that grew into something much more meaningful.
Early in her first term, Lott kept walking past the Islamic Community Center of Vermont, just a few blocks from her house, and decided to stop in and introduce herself.  “Eventually someone answered, and I was like, ‘Hi, I’m the mayor,” Lott said, laughing. 
What started as a tentative knock on the door grew into a lasting relationship. Lott helped open lines of communication between mosque members, city staff and school liaisons that hadn’t existed before. She calls it her “biggest small win.” 
“The relationship building I did with the Islamic community through the mosque made me feel so good,” she said. “What was seemingly a small effort on my part really made them feel more included.” Lott said it will feel strange to lose the constant connection to what is happening around town.
“I’m just not going to be as plugged in as I was before,” she said. Lott is now ready for a new chapter filled with more time for herself and her family. She’s excited to enjoy the fall weather and welcome her first child later this year. 
“It’s going to be very freeing,” she said. 
Lott doesn’t hesitate to encourage young people to get involved in local politics. She said every perspective adds value to the community.

“Just do it,” she said. “You don’t need any special training or experience. The politics we’re doing at the local level impact everyone who lives here, and the more different perspectives we can get involved, the better the outcomes will be.”

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Communities around Louisiana, in a bid to get more information about the environmental and health impacts of industrial pollution, are taking data collection into their own hands — despite a law restricting how their research findings can be used to enforce air quality regulations. 
The practice is called community, citizen or participatory science, and it involves data collected from non-scientists that’s passed along to researchers who use their expertise to study and understand what they mean. From air quality to fisheries impacts, the grassroots-gathered information has the potential to inform the public about impacts of nearby industry. 
“Our challenge for really a couple decades has been: How can we get something that can empower the communities to be able to speak for themselves, about the issues, with data?” said Marylee Orr, executive director of Louisiana Environmental Action Network. 
The Louisiana-based nonprofit, long involved with community air monitoring projects, recently posted on its website an interactive air monitoring dashboard. The site gives continuous updates from air quality sensors placed at four locations along the Mississippi River in the heavily industrialized corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The dashboard also lists locations and readings from Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality monitors.

The system, funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, uses stationary air quality sensors to measure spikes in air pollutant levels. Toxic emissions such as sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and volatile organic compounds can be detected, recorded and displayed on the online dashboard, providing neighboring communities with information about potential health risks. 
Similar efforts to get hard numbers for air and water quality concerns are also happening in Cameron Parish, where community air monitoring and water quality research partnerships are expanding. The area is the site of three liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals, and six more LNG facilities are either under construction or in the planning stages.
Environmental groups, including the Habitat Recovery Project and For a Better Bayou, have been working to secure funding for air quality monitoring equipment and underwater sound research in an attempt to find the source of air pollution and fisheries disruptions in the region. 
“Stories hold weight, and science and data holds weight,” Habitat Recovery Project director Alyssa Portaro. “When we put these two things together, it really gives a robust picture of what’s going on.” 
Fishermen and advocates alike suspect air quality and fisheries problems in Cameron have ties to the nearby LNG facilities but have no independent data to back up their suspicions. The environmental groups received grants to buy monitoring equipment and hire fishermen to collect data and partner with scientists for research projects.
“Nobody knows exactly what’s going on out here,” said Sky Leger, a fisherman who works along Cameron Parish’s coast. He and his girlfriend, restaurant worker Karri Hooper, recently got involved with community science monitoring, in part, to help track whether noise from boat traffic and LNG facility construction is impacting adjacent fishing grounds.

Around the country, scientific communities have seen growing acceptance of data collection in partnership with non-scientists. 
“There’s been increasing recognition of the power of these types of projects to collect really useful data,” said Bradley Allf, a postdoctoral research associate at Colorado State University who uses participatory science to study urban ecology and conservation.
Allf studied the concept of citizen science data collection for his doctoral thesis, saying the research technique has grown in popularity as well as acceptance within the scientific community over recent decades. 
“There was some hesitation around whether we can really trust data collected by people who haven’t necessarily been trained in science,” Allf said. “I don’t think that’s very true anymore.”
Despite its expanding acceptance, the struggle to increase transparency around industry’s environmental impact in Louisiana with community-gathered data faces legal hurdles. 
The Louisiana Legislature approved a law in 2024 enacting strict qualitative standards for community air monitoring programs in order to be considered valid data that state regulators could use for oversight or enforcement. 
Air-monitoring equipment and analysis must use the most current EPA-approved techniques, and data must be analyzed at labs the Louisiana Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program certifies, according to the legislation dubbed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act.
Environmental groups argue these standards, which can be costly, prices them out of being able to do research. The cost for the state’s preferred monitoring equipment runs up to $500,000 dollars, said former EPA official Larry Starfield, an adviser to Orr’s monitoring dashboard project
“That’s not something that is accessible,” said Misha Mayeur with the Habitat Recovery Project. 
The equipment her group intends to buy with current grant proceeds costs around $11,000, cheaper than the regulatory monitors that cost more than their entire annual budget to buy. 
The sensors the Louisiana Environmental Action Network uses for its stationary air monitoring in Southeast Louisiana, like those in Cameron Parish, aren’t up to the standards for regulatory enforcement in the 2024 state law. The regulatory monitors required in Louisiana to allege pollution violations cost around $500,000 dollars, said former EPA official Larry Starfield.
Even if the data can’t be used to enforce air quality standards for Louisiana, Orr said there’s still value in community awareness that could prompt change. 
“If the data suggest a problem, it’s an opportunity for communities to invite companies to investigate their concerns,” said Orr. 
Starfield said he hopes keeping the community informed could offer a way to let industry prove its willingness to cooperate and improve air quality. 
“Many of the workers live in the community. Why wouldn’t you want to have a good relationship?” he said. 
President and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association and Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance president David Cresson responded to the launch of LEAN’s dashboard in a statement emailed to the Illuminator, saying the association was reviewing LEAN’s data and methodology. 
“We hope to continue to work with LEAN to identify the areas of impact as indicated by their data, and if the specific source can be verified, take practical steps to remediate the issue,” Cresson said in a statement from the association.
And if industry chooses not to cooperate, Starfield said data can help encourage state and federal entities to get involved. 
“The idea is to engage Louisiana [Department of Environmental Quality] and EPA in a situation where there’s a feeling that there’s a problem here, we’re seeing a pattern,” he said. “Certainly bringing in EPA and bringing in LDEQ and asking them to investigate … that’s absolutely a good thing.”
Fishermen in Cameron used their collective voice to engage state enforcement in August when they brought to light impacts to oysters, crabs and fish from dredging spills near the site where Venture Global’s CP2 LNG facility is being built. 
Venture Global initially claimed there were no sediment spills or harmed fisheries. But at the urging of fishermen, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries sent a biologist to study the area, and the official later confirmed oysters had been killed.

“The only thing that they’re going off of is by the reports of the people that Venture Global hired,” Leger said. “But we have the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries coming out here and checking the oysters … and they are saying that there is very much so a problem with sediment being on top of those oysters in the lake.”
Portaro said this example is a strong argument for informing the community, as well as involving scientists, in documenting air and water quality issues in places like Cameron Parish. 
“The fishermen were able to verify that, document it; then Fish and Wildlife came out and said, ‘Yeah, there is mud in the lake,’” said Portaro. “Sometimes the biologists on the job need the community keeping an eye on them, a well-informed community.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cameron-community-science-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-02 06:16:51.508557

But the next year, a 26-year-old Republican woman named Erin Stewart was elected mayor.
It was the start of a 12-year run for Stewart. She has been reelected every two years, the beneficiary of her own brand of fusion politics, an aversion to polarizing national issues, and the low turnout in municipal races that tend to blunt a Democratic advantage in voter registration.
On Tuesday, Democrats will try to exploit open seats for mayor or first selectman in New Britain, Norwich and Torrington and the coastal suburbs of Branford and Westport. They are held by Republicans, and all the communities except Torrington have Democratic advantages in voter registration.
More than 150,000 votes already had been cast as of 10 a.m. Saturday in early voting that ends ends Sunday, with 75,657 ballots cast by Democrats, 33,474 by Republicans and 43,936 by unaffiliated voters.
With no competitive mayoral contests in the larger cities, New Britain is the marquee race. Gov. Ned Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal headlined a rally there Saturday for the Democratic nominee, state Rep. Bobby Sanchez.

A victory there would be important to Democrats on two counts: It is home to Stewart, who is exiting city hall to focus on a run for governor in 2026, and it offers a test of the degree to which animosity to President Donald Trump can be used to turn out Democrats who typically vote only in presidential years.
“I’m listening to a lot of individuals throughout the city in New Britain that are not happy with the current administration in Washington, D.C., and I think that’s going to trickle down to our local elections this year,” Sanchez said. “The working poor are really pissed off they are not going to get SNAP benefits.”
The Trump administration ordered the suspension of the SNAP food program, effective on Saturday, the start of the second month of the partial federal shutdown. Two federal judges ordered Friday that payments resume, but it could take days to restart a program that relies on federal vendors using state data to load benefits on electric benefit transfer, or EBT, cards.
Sanchez, 64, is a soft-spoken nonprofit administrator who has been a state lawmaker for 14 years. He trying to become the first Hispanic mayor of a city known for its Polish immigrant heritage but is now 43% Latino or Hispanic and 14% Black.
New Britain is a city of 74,000 where the poverty rate is 20%, median household income is $51,586, nearly 11,000 people rely on SNAP federal assistance for food and 30,000 rely on Medicaid for health care. Democrats are exploiting the interruption of SNAP and threats to Medicaid.
“We’ve made a big point of that in campaigning, that everybody is on the line,” said Don DeFronzo, a former New Britain mayor and state senator supporting Sanchez. Democrats “did a mailing this week that says, ‘Today, it’s SNAP. Tomorrow, it’s Medicaid. Tomorrow, it’s Social Security.’”
GOP voter registration increased during Stewart’s tenure, but Democrats still outnumber Republicans in the city by nearly a 3-1 margin.
The Republican nominee for mayor is Sharon Beloin-Saavedra, 60, an alderwoman who was a Democrat until last year, albeit one who was allied with Stewart and most recently was elected on the GOP line. She bristles at any attempt to associate her with Trump.
“I don’t support Trump, but I support Erin Stewart. I support the city of New Britain,” Beloin-Saavedra said. “Donald Trump has nothing to do with the city of New Britain.”
Ben Proto, the chair of the Connecticut Republican Party, said Trump is a tactical distraction employed by Democrats, not a relevant factor in running a municipality.
“If the most important issue to you is whether or not the pride flag gets flown over town hall, well, I think you’re missing the whole point of municipal government,” Proto said. “I think other people care more about other things, like, more importantly, did my trash get picked up? Did my street get plowed? Did the ambulance show up when my kid fell out of the tree and broke his arm?”
Stewart, anticipating a Republican primary for governor, now embraces Trump after studiously keeping a distance. When she opened an exploratory campaign for governor in January, she announced without prompting that she had voted for Trump in all three of his campaigns for the White House.
“It’s not that she’s necessarily a rabid Trumper, but she empowers him,” DeFronzo said of Beloin-Saavedra. “They all do. By being there, they empower him to do what he’s doing. And no one has the balls to stand up and say, ‘No, stop!’ I think it makes a difference.” 
Speaking at the rally, Blumenthal said, “It’s us vs. them, and you have a right to ask, ‘Who is on my side?’”
Other cities
There are no mayoral races in Bridgeport, Hartford or Waterbury, where mayors are at the midpoint of four year terms.
Stamford Mayor Caroline Simmons and New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker are heavily favored in their reelection campaigns. There are open mayoral races in Hamden and Norwalk, where Democratic primaries in August determined the likely winners on Tuesday, given the voter registration.
On Saturday, Lamont left the New Britain event to campaign in Torrington, where the Republican mayor, Elinor Carbone, also is leaving office after a dozen years.  Democrat Stephen Ivain, a councilman and Democratic chair, is facing Republican Molly E. Spino, a former Marine who has served on the council and board of education.
Torrington has trended Republican in both voter registration and election results. Trump won handily in 2024, and a long-time Democratic lawmaker was unseated.
In Norwich, Democrat Singh Swarnjit is attempting to become first Sikh elected as a mayor in Connecticut. He faces Republican Stacy Gould in a city where Democrats have nearly a 2-1 voter registration advantage. Republican Mayor Peter Nystrom did not seek another term.
In Westport, a wealthy Fairfield County town that also has more than a 2-1 Democratic advantage, Republican First Selectwoman Jen Tooker is not running, creating an opening for Democrats. Tooker won four years ago with just 50.03% of the vote. The candidates trying to succeed her are Democrat Kevin Christie and Republican Don O’Day.
In Branford, Republican First Selectman Jamie Cosgrove is not running, an opportiunity in a community where Democrats outnumber Republicans, 7,113 to 4,362. The candidates are Democrat Josh Brooks and Republican Jeff Vailette.
Bristol, a community with a Democratic edge in voter registration and a history of close elections, has a mayoral rematch. Democrat Ellen Zoppo-Sassu is challenging Republican Jeff Caggiano, who narrowly unseated her four years ago. Trump and national politics went unmentioned in a debate last week.

(Nuclear Regulatory Commission)Swords or ploughshares?
That’s the dilemma that has plagued us since the sudden dawn of the nuclear age. Should we split atoms for peace or to rain destruction on our enemies? In the space of a single human life we’ve done both, killing hundreds of thousands in two atomic bomb attacks on Japan and then building nuclear reactors to provide light, power and medicine.
Radioactivity was discovered just more than a century ago, when Wilhelm Roentgen detected X-rays. In high school textbooks, most of us saw the ghostly radiograph of his wife Anna’s skeletal hand with wedding band, “Hand mit Ringen.” The image — the first X-ray — prompted Anna to remark, “I have seen my own death.” In 1913, science fiction writer H.G. Wells predicted both nuclear power and weaponry, in “The World Set Free.” In 1938, the trio of Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann were first to recognize that uranium atoms split when bombarded by neutrons. When physicist Leo Szilard confirmed fission, according to author Edward A. Friedman, he said ”the world was headed for sorrow.”
In 1939, Szilard and Albert Einstein sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt advising that fission could be used to create a powerful new bomb. The scientists feared the Nazis were already working on such a device, and their letter helped spur creation of the secret Manhattan Project, which eventually resulted to the test firing of the first atomic bomb in a remote part of New Mexico in 1945. Three weeks later came the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.
The Cold War began shortly after, and by 1949 our former allies, the Soviets, had their own nuclear weapon, too.
Later we created nuclear weapons stockpiles ready to kill hundreds of millions more and built dozens of nuclear generating plants to provide about 20% of the American electrical supply. One of those plants, Wolf Creek, owned by two regional utilities, has been online in Kansas since 1985.
Now comes a firm founded by one of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates, with the lure of bringing “advanced” nuclear power to Kansas. TerraPower announced a partnership last month with the state’s Department of Commerce and Evergy, one of the owners of Wolf Creek, to explore placing a natrium reactor somewhere in the utility’s service area of eastern Kansas.
TerraPower is already building a $4 billion pilot natrium reactor site in Wyoming, with half of the funding from the US Department of Energy. Some of the projected energy may power AI data centers. The company promises clean and safe power through its innovative technology, which uses molten salt (natrium is Latin for sodium) to cool the 345-megawatt reactor instead of water, as is done at Wolf Creek and every other commercial nuclear plant in the U.S.
A few Kansas communities in Evergy country have already tossed their hardhats in the ring to host the natrium reactor, including my home city of Emporia. The city commission, along with the county board and a regional development association, signed a letter of support for the project. Commissioners in Coffey County, home to the Wolf Creek plant, have also expressed interest, as have officials in Hutchinson.
TerraPower claims it will only place reactors where they are wanted, but there’s not been time for any substantive public discussion yet on the issue. Nobody asked Kansans whether we want a second nuclear plant or not. Another firm, Deep Fission, is working with an undisclosed partner to place reactors at the bottom of mile-deep holes in Kansas to supply power-hungry AI centers, but it’s not answering questions about details or whether it has sought state approval.
The gold rush for new nuclear is on.
We are, according to current U.S. policy, on the verge of a “new nuclear renaissance.” Old fears spawned by Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl are receding in popular memory. There is now public and bipartisan support for expanding nuclear power, according to a Pew Research Center poll.
It is understandable why leaders in a community like Emporia — which logged the state’s highest unemployment following the closure of Tyson meats — would find TerraPower’s projected 1,500 construction and 500 permanent jobs attractive.
But those vying to bring TerraPower jobs to their communities might want to cool their enthusiasm long enough to consider the safety and security risks presented by natrium reactors.
These risks were described to me by Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy group. Lyman is an expert on nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and safety and security. He’s also one of the authors of “Fukishima: The Story of a Nuclear Disaster.”
“I have signifcant concerns,” Lyman said, “related to safety and security as well as for the economics. … It’s inexplicable to me why there’s so much enthusiasm for this type of reactor.”
When I spoke with Lyman on Tuesday, he’d just finished monitoring a multi-day Nuclear Regulatory Commission advisory committee meeting reviewing the preliminary safeguard assessment of the TerraPower’s Wyoming reactor.
It is important to note that TerraPower refused my repeated requests for an interview. “TerraPower will have to politely decline participation in this opportunity at this time,” public relations specialist Brooke Leader said on behalf of the firm.
The problems with the natrium reactor, Lyman said, are inherent in the design of any sodium-cooled reactor. The molten sodium bursts into flame upon contact with air or water, he said, and these types of reactors have historically been expensive to build and prone to leaks. But, he said, the most worrying thing about the natrium reactor is that it uses fuel enriched to up to 20% of the isotope Uranium 235. This fuel is called HALEU, for high assay low enrichment uranium, and it’s just below the threshold for weapons-grade material.
Conventional nuclear reactors use fuel that is between 3 and 5% enriched.
Natrium reactors require HALEU to make them smaller and more efficient, Lyman said, but there is no domestic source of this fuel available in the quantities needed. In addition, security at natrium reactors would have to be beefed up compared with conventional reactors, because HALEU is attractive to terrorists and rogue states. Enriching uranium to 20% represents most of the effort required to make weapons-grade material.
In addition, there’s the problem — inherent with every reactor currently operating or planned in the United States — that there’s no long-term storage solution for spent fuel. Work on the Yucca Mountain geologic repository was halted in 2010. All waste is stored on-site, in cooling ponds and dry casks. It will remain hazardous for much longer than there has been recorded history — tens of thousands of years.
We can’t even keep the government running year-round or provide reliable food and health care to our poorest Americans. How can we expect to keep the distant future safe from us?
The immediate risk with a natrium reactor, Lyman said, is fire.
Molten sodium “is a highly reactive material, so you have to keep it away from the air and water at all costs,” Lyman said, “or you could end up with a sodium fire. And having a nuclear reactor where the coolant itself can catch on fire just sounds like a bad idea. It really is. So they have to go to extraordinary lengths to prevent any exposure of the coolant to air or water.”
This adds a level of unneeded complexity, he said. Even though TerraPower claims that natrium reactors are safer than light water-cooled reactors, Lyman said just the opposite is true. The time to respond to accidents is much shorter, he said, and there is no containment structure — the familiar dome-shaped vessel — as additional backup to contain leaks.
“The Department of Energy is trying, with Congress’s help, to stimulate and stand up a whole production program for this kind of (HALEU) material,” Lyman said. “But the demand is very unclear. The investments are on the order of billions and billions of dollars for an infrastructure to make this fuel. It’s a risky proposition, and it’s not clear that TerraPower is going to have the amount of fuel it needs just for the first plant.”
Because TerraPower would not speak to me, I will rely on author Edward A. Friedman, in his 2025 book “Nuclear Energy: boom, Bust, and Emerging Renaissance,” to make the case for next generation reactor technology.
“The promise for successful realization of (advanced) technology was significantly enhanced with the groundbreaking of the TerraPower sodium-cooled natrium reactor,” Friedman writes. Bills Gates’s company, TerraPower, began construction June 10, 2024, at Kemmerer, Wyoming,  “of the natrium fast-neutron, liquid sodium-cooled reactor (SFR) that uses an associated liquid salt storage system. This fail-safe, small modular reactor (SMR) will be the first model in the world for cost-effective replacement of a coal-fired power plant with a nuclear reactor.”
The reactor is expected to become operational in 2030.
Gates hopes for hundreds of coal-to-nuclear transformations in the future, according to Friedman. Indeed, the vision of replacing fossil fuel that drove Gates to found TerraPower in the first place.
“There’s no scenario in which we keep adding carbon to the atmosphere and the world stops getting hotter,” Gates wrote in his 2021 book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.”
“The hotter it gets, the harder it will be for humans to survive, much less thrive,” Gates wrote.
Nuclear is the only carbon-free energy source, he said, that can reliably deliver power day and night through any type of weather on a large scale. It’s also one of the few practical ways to bring electricity to the poorest of countries, such as those found in sub-Saharan Africa. Access to energy is highly correlated to wealth and happiness.
“It’s no secret that nuclear power has its problems,” Gates wrote. “It’s very expensive to build today. Human error can cause accidents. Uranium, the fuel it uses, can be converted for use in weapons. The waste is dangerous and hard to store.”
Yet, nuclear represented our best hope of stopping global warming, he claimed. There was nothing more important than halting the rise in temperature if we were to avoid catastrophe.
Recently, Gates has changed his tune on climate.
In a memo to COP30, the United Nations climate change conference scheduled for next week in Brazil, Gates abandoned his previous “net zero” views. He criticized “doomsday” climate scenarios and suggested that people will be able to “live and thrive” in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future. It’s time to put “human welfare” at the center of climate strategies and improving agriculture and health in the poorest countries.
“Climate change is a serious problem,” he said, “but it will not be the end of civilization.”
The memo sounds like nothing short of a retreat from climate activism from a man who had spent personal billions on a quest for net zero. In the case of his push for advanced reactors, Gates may have been so driven by his desire to stop global warming that he swallowed the nuclear pill.
His sudden redirection must be having some effect on TerraPower, the company he founded. But his memo will have no effect on the U.S. delegation to COP30, because there will be no official American presence there. Donald Trump had already pulled the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. The world has now blown past the agreement’s 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global warming, with more climate suffering to follow.
Trump recently directed the United States to resume nuclear weapons testing, something we haven’t done since 1992. There is not yet a name for this arms race, but it is on as surely as the seas are rising. I am reminded of Damocles from Greek mythology, who was taught the dangers of power by the sword dangling above. So let us call this the Age of Damocles, because nothing is happy for those wracked by anxiety.
It is no coincidence that we embrace a new arms race at the same moment we accelerate the regulatory process to approve and deploy new types of nuclear reactors that use disturbingly enriched fuel. While nuclear proponents like Friedman dismiss opposition to nuclear power as an artifact of the Cold War and media misinformation, there were reasons for those fears. Troubling issues remain.
Opposition to nuclear power that curbed the U.S. nuclear power program from the 1980s until recently was based not only on fictional movies like 1979’s “The China Syndrome” but in real-life accidents like Fukishima in 2011, in which an earthquake and tsunami shut down the power grid and made it impossible to cool the reactors. More recently, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, has caused alarm because it’s been damaged and sometimes cut off in the ongoing war with Russia. Movies that might contain some inaccuracies, such as the 2019 HBO miniseries “Chernobyl,” are not causes of our nuclear jitters but expressions of them.
This is the global context in which we find ourselves pondering whether a new type of nuclear energy is good for Kansas or just a costly experiment that will risk accident or murderous mayhem. We live in a new period of global instability, one driven by all the old forces — greed, ignorance, haste, denial — that have plagued us since the ice receded. The communications from TerraPower have been carefully curated to present a sanitized version of a techno billionaire philanthropist’s dream of a nuclear renaissance.
I’m cold to the idea of spending billions on nuke plants to power, in large part, electricity-hungry AI data centers. It seems immoral when so many Americans go hungry and are without health insurance. Beyond that, there’s just too many unanswered questions about next-generation reactors.
But I’m opposed to the TerraPower plan for a natrium reactor in Kansas not because of the unknowns — where, how much, how long? — but because of what we do know. The HALEU fuel, in the amounts needed, presents an unacceptable risk of nuclear proliferation.
Let us not unknowingly beat our ploughshares into swords.

Manfred Mann
Has this ever happened to you?  You’re driving on a narrow road in the dark, when the headlights of oncoming traffic suddenly blind you, leaving you wondering where is the road and whether you might crash.


With sunset now coming as early as 5 p.m. (thanks to the return to Standard Time), driving in the dark becomes a real challenge if not a danger.  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data shows nighttime crashes are three times more likely than daytime, even on dry roads.
Why is this happening?  There are several reasons that headlights appear so bright.  The first is that the headlights may not be properly aligned, aiming too high.  And with more vehicles riding higher from the road (think SUVs and trucks), their headlights shine more directly into oncoming traffic.
Most problematic are the new kinds of headlights we use.  The older incandescent (yellowish) lightbulbs are being replaced by LED or xenon lights, which are blue-white and more glaring to your eyes. That’s because bright oncoming headlights, especially the bluish ones, cause the pupils in your eyes to constrict rapidly, literally blinding you until the oncoming vehicle passes and your eyes adjust.
What can you do? When bright lights come at you, don’t look into the oncoming beam.  Instead, look to the right edge or lane marker of your driving lane.  Use anti-glare mirrors, especially  in your rearview mirror,  so headlights on vehicles behind you don’t hit your eyes.
Most of all, slow down!  Being blinded on darkened roads, coated with wet slippery leaves, is dangerous.
Will blue light glasses help?  Even with good driving habits, glare from new headlight technology can still feel intense leading some drivers to look for solutions like special glasses.  
But the jury’s still out on this idea.  Some manufacturers and optometrists say that lenses designed to block or filter short-wavelength blue light can help reduce the perceived glare by filtering out that part of the spectrum.  Some glasses described as “for night driving” (the ones that are often yellow in tint) also have reflective coatings.
Doctors say some patients swear by these specs, making them more confident.  But safety experts say you shouldn’t take this as license to drive faster than is safe for the road conditions.
What else can you do? You can start by making sure you’re not part of the problem.  Get your own headlights checked for alignment at your mechanic or national chains like Midas or Goodyear.  It’ll cost you about $100.
It used to be that the Connecticut Division of Motor Vehicles checked headlight alignments during your bi-annual emissions tests, but that ended in 2001.  A bill (HB 6163) before the Connecticut legislature in 2023 would have restored those tests, but it never became law.
In the United Kingdom they’re taking this problem more seriously, upping testing of headlight brightness and where they aim down the road.  Some are even calling for a ban on super-bright LED and xenon bulbs.  UK stats claim 280 collisions a year in that country are caused by the dazzling bulbs.
Meantime, take it easy on the roads at night.  Maybe even avoid driving in those hours, if you can.  Try the glasses, if you’d like.  But above all… stay safe!",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/headlights.jpg,,,2025-11-02 04:56:18.340335

(Photo by Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]NEWARK — Former President Barack Obama made a push for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill during a raucous campaign rally just days before Election Day.
“If you meet this moment, if you believe change can happen, you will not just elect Mikie Sherrill as your next governor, you will not just put New Jersey on a brighter path, you will set a glorious example for this nation,” Obama said Saturday to a packed house in the Essex County College gym.
More than 2,000 people attended the rally, cheering for the former president, chanting in support of Sherrill, and holding blue-and-white signs reading, “Hit the road, Jack,” and “Let’s land this,” a reference to Sherrill’s background as a helicopter pilot for the U.S. Navy. Hundreds who couldn’t snag tickets watched on a screen outside.
Saturday’s event was the latest in a string of events to boost voter turnout ahead of Tuesday’s election, where Sherrill and Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli are on the ballot. Polls show Sherrill ahead with a narrow lead, and Ciattarelli has been holding his own campaign stops with high-profile guests.
New Jersey is one of two states with a gubernatorial election this year, and they are often framed as a signal of voter sentiment one year after the presidential race and a year ahead of congressional elections.
Democrats from across the state came out to support Sherrill, including Democratic Reps. LaMonica McIver, Rob Menendez, Frank Pallone, and Nellie Pou, and local lawmakers like state Sens. Teresa Ruiz and Vin Gopal. Gov. Phil Murphy and his wife, Tammy, also spoke to the crowd in advance of the ex-president’s remarks. 
Rep. Josh Gottheimer, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, and former teachers union chief Sean Spiller — who all ran against Sherrill in the June Democratic primary — also attended. 
Sherrill, who walked on stage to Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run,” was greeted with a standing ovation and chants of “Mikie! Mikie!” 
She largely repeated her standard stump-speech promises, saying she would stand up to President Donald Trump, make New Jersey more affordable, and fight for the middle class. She also restated her pledges to freeze utility rates on her first day in office, lower prescription drug costs, and improve public schools. 
Sherrill attacked Ciattarelli for aligning with Trump, who held a tele-rally in support of the GOP nominee last week. The crowd often booed at the mere mention of Republicans. 
“I’m feeling nothing but courage. New Jersey will need courage, courage to make a change,” Sherrill said during her 20-minute speech. “Anger and courage are the daughters of hope.”

More than 1 million people have already cast ballots in New Jersey, either through early in-person voting or using mail ballots. Sherrill encouraged everyone to get their “friends, family, and frenemies” to get out and vote. 
Obama took the stage at around 7 p.m., hours after appearing in Virginia to support Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee in that state’s governor’s race. During his 40-minute speech, during which the audience in Newark remained standing, Obama told voters they “have a candidate worth being excited about.”
He slammed Trump for unleashing masked law enforcement to enforce immigration laws, wreaking havoc on federal workers and people dependent on food stamps during the government shutdown, and weaponizing the U.S. Department of Justice to go after his political enemies.
Obama said the country and our politics are “in a pretty dark place right now.”
“The good news is there is something you can do about it, New Jersey, right here, right now. You’ve got a candidate for governor … someone who sees you and knows your struggles,” he said. 
Obama said Sherrill, if elected, would work “with anyone if it helps the people of New Jersey, and she will listen to everyone too, whether they voted for her or not.” 
He also took aim at Ciattarelli for running for governor three times — Obama joked he believes in “persistence, but at a certain point” — and said that during Ciattarelli’s current campaign, he had to “suck up” to Trump. 
“At the end of the day, what this election is about, what politics in a democracy is always about, is values,” he said. “What do we care about? What are we voting for? What do we prioritize? What are our core convictions?”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Saturday in Norfolk, former President Barack Obama lent a familiar and energizing presence to a campaign rally for Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for Virginia governor. 
Obama headlined the event, where Virginia Democratic lawmakers at the state and federal level as well as Spanberger’s running mates spoke in support of her in a final attempt to galvanize voters ahead of Tuesday’s historic race, where Spanberger or Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears will be elected the state’s first woman governor.
The crowd of roughly 7,000 chanted “yes we can” and sang songs before the speakers — including Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News and Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Ghazala Hashmi and attorney general candidate Jay Jones — took the stage.

All of them drew applause, but the crowd roared with excitement when the country’s 44th president walked to the podium. The rally, days ahead of Election Day, is the third time Obama has stumped for Virginia’s gubernatorial nominees since leaving the White House.
Obama portrayed Spanberger as a “workhorse” in Congress whose bipartisan track record will translate to good governing. 
“Abigail does not just say the right thing,” Obama said. “As your governor, she will do the right thing.” 
Spanberger called Obama “someone who represents the very best of public service” whom she was “honored and humbled” to have in Virginia to cheer her on.
 Themes of service, bipartisan cooperation

Service, Spanberger emphasized in her speech before Obama’s, has been the core of her career — first, in law enforcement, then the Central Intelligence Agency, and later in Congress where she worked with lawmakers of both parties to pass bills that became law. 
She recalled how health care policy first inspired her to run for office. Frustrated by Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act — Obama’s legacy as president — she said “I knew I had to do something.” 
“Spoiler alert, I won,” she said of being elected to Congress, flipping the 7th  District to Democratic control and defending the seat two more terms before deciding to seek the governorship. 
Health care remains a critical issue this election cycle both in Virginia and nationally, as the Republican-controlled Congress passed a reconciliation bill this summer that will trigger changes to hospital funding mechanisms and may cause millions of Americans to lose Medicaid coverage. Members of Virginia’s congressional delegation are also trying to extend ACA subsidies that help low-income earners purchase health insurance, but those efforts have been stalled amid the current government shutdown. 
In addition to health care affordability, Spanberger noted her goals to address housing, and energy affordability and said as governor, she would stand firm against overreach from President Donald Trump’s administration while finding ways to work across the aisle. 
“You deserve a governor who will work with Democrats and Republicans to grow our economy and not stand by while Virginia’s workforce is under attack,” she said, a reference to the Trump administration’s layoffs of federal workers. Virginia is home to nearly 150,000 civilian federal employees.
“When I was in Congress, I worked with anybody and everybody to deliver results,” Spanberger said. 
 ‘We need that light’

After branding her the next governor of Virginia, Obama asked voters to cast their ballots for Spanberger. As he reflected on the first 10 months of Trump’s second term in office — marked by the federal layoffs, ramped up anti-immigration efforts and growing economic strains — Obama pitched Spanberger as an inspiration amid the widescale uncertainty. 
“And Lord knows, we need that light. We need that inspiration, because let’s face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,” he said. “It’s hard to know where to start, because every day, this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness.”
“I know I’m the ‘hope and change’ guy,” Obama said in reference to his winning presidential campaign slogans, but he emphasized he is “worried” about the direction of the nation under Trump. Obama criticized Capitol Hill Republicans for the ongoing government shutdown and Trump for “using the Justice Department for going after his political opponents,” “deploying the National Guard in American cities, claiming to stop crime waves that don’t actually exist,” and other actions to which the crowd booed in response.  
“Don’t boo, vote,” Obama said, a callback to 2016 when he supported Hillary Clinton for president. “They don’t hear boos, they hear votes.”
 Jones joins the rally

The event also featured Democratic lieutenant governor candidate Hashmi and attorney general candidate Jones — the first time both have campaigned in person with Spanberger since news broke of violent texts Jones sent in 2022. 
Jones apologized to former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his family for the texts at an  Oct. 16 debate with Republican incumbent Jason Miyares. In the messages, Jones said hypothetically he would kill Gilbert with “two bullets” and referenced his children dying.  
The incident was not rehashed during the Saturday rally with Obama, as Jones reiterated his commitment to standing up to Trump if elected. As the top lawyers for the state, attorneys general have responsibilities that range from consumer protection to providing legal counsel to governors and signing onto multi-state lawsuits. 
“I’m running for attorney general to put Virginia first,” he said as the crowd cheered. 
With over one million votes already cast via early voting, Election Day on Tuesday, Nov. 4 will determine who next helms Virginia’s executive branch and which party will control its House of Delegates, where all 100 seats are on the ballot.

The Caesar Rodney Riders scored 21 points in the second quarter to beat the Cape Henlopen Vikings, 35-14, Thursday night.
 
CAMDEN — Amidst a moderate downpour of rain, Caesar Rodney’s senior quarterback Quinn Deviere stood in the pistol formation awaiting the snap on third down. Needing four yards for a new set of downs, Deviere caught the snap and surveyed the field starting to his right working his way back to the middle of the field. That’s where he found sophomore Denzel Jones.
Deviere launched his pass through the rain to Jones overtop the second level of the defense. Jones leaped up and caught the elevated pass securing it with two hands without breaking his stride. Jones burst across the field to the left sideline where he turned upfield and finished the play in the endzone for the Riders’ first score of the game. 
Jones’ 46-yard touchdown catch was one of three consecutive touchdowns for Caesar Rodney in the second quarter that helped them defeat Cape Henlopen, 35-14, Thursday night.
The Riders scored their next touchdown just a few minutes after their first. The Riders started their offensive possession on the Vikings’ 20 yard line following a turnover on the kick-off. On the second play of the drive, Deviere connected with senior Jayden Minor at the back of the endzone to take the lead. 
Deviere’s third touchdown pass of the game came in the final minutes of the first half on a deep ball to Jones. The sophomore caught the pass and raced 60-yards to the endzone completing a strong second quarter for Caesar Rodney.

The whole second quarter was played while rain poured down on the players, coaches and fans. The heaviest rain started with about six minutes left to play in the first quarter and lasted until the end of the half. The skies were clear for the Riders’ senior night celebration pregame and the Vikings first touchdown of the game in the first quarter.  
Junior quarterback Jameson Tingle scored Cape Henlopen’s first touchdown on their first offensive possession of the game. On third and goal, Tingle took the quarterback keeper and dove into the endzone for the rushing touchdown. Junior running back Ozmeer Batson scored the Vikings’ other touchdown in the late stages of the third quarter on a one yard run through the middle of the defense.

The Riders held the district’s second best scoring offense scoreless the rest of the way and added a pair of scores in the fourth quarter to earn the victory.
Caesar Rodney is 2-2 in 3A district two play this season sitting behind the undefeated Smyrna High School in the standings. Cape Henlopen is also 2-2 in district play. The two teams are tied with St. Georges and Sussex Central whom also have 2-2 district records.

,DC,2025-11-01 20:33:46+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump administration must restart SNAP benefits by Wednesday, judge rules",Jane Norman,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-must-restart-snap-benefits-wednesday-judge-rules,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Saturday issued a written order saying there is “no question” that U.S. Department of Agriculture contingency funds must be used to provide food assistance for 42 million Americans during the government shutdown.Rhode Island U.S. District Court Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. had said during a Friday hearing he was granting a temporary restraining order sought by cities and nonprofit groups. McConnell ordered that the government distribute payments of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. Because Congress is locked in a stalemate over a stopgap spending bill and did not appropriate money for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, Trump administration officials had said the program could not provide SNAP benefits beyond Saturday.In response to McConnell, President Donald Trump in a social media post later Friday said administration lawyers believed the funds could not legally be paid and that he needed clarification about how to distribute SNAP benefits. “I do not want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT,” Trump said.  “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding …”Government lawyers also filed a brief in the Rhode Island case asking McConnell to clarify how his order could legally be carried out, noting it was delivered orally and there was no written transcript.In his Saturday order, McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, quoted Trump and said, “So, here’s the ORDER and here’s the legal direction from the Court.”In a footnote, the McConnell order also said: “The Court greatly appreciates the President’s quick and definitive response to this Court’s Order and his desire to provide the necessary SNAP funding.”McConnell said it was likely that the plaintiffs would succeed in their case. He noted that Congress appropriated funds for SNAP in an annual spending bill, and lawmakers directed that $3 billion should be put in reserve through Sept. 30, 2026. Another $3 billion in a later bill was put aside until Sept. 30, 2027. “There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown; in fact, the President during his first term issued guidance indicating that these contingency funds are available if SNAP funds lapse due to a government shutdown,” McConnell said.Two options in written orderBecause the $6 billion is not enough to cover the estimated $9 billion cost of November benefits, government lawyers have said it would be difficult to determine reduced benefits, McConnell said. He said USDA then should “within its discretion, find the additional funds necessary” to fund the full $9 billion, suggesting use of $23 billion in a fund for state child nutrition programs.If the government chooses to make full SNAP payments for November, it must do so by the end of the day Monday, he said. If instead the government makes a partial payment of SNAP funds, then it must pay out all the $6 billion in contingency funds by Wednesday, he said.He asked the government to update him by noon Monday how it was complying with the order.In a separate case, a federal judge in Boston also ruled Friday that the USDA plan to pause SNAP was illegal — but gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her finding before she decides on a motion to force the benefits be paid despite the ongoing government shutdown.No matter what happens on Monday, experts and a key member of Congress have said that some SNAP recipients still may see delays in their benefits because changes in administration from the federal government to states to vendors take time. In states, SNAP benefits are loaded onto cards on varying dates, but the Saturday cutoff would have been effective for November benefits.",,,,2025-11-01 17:00:57.686047

First, colleges are not doing enough to build purpose, confidence, agency, and maturity. Colleges are not the cause of growing anxiety and a declining sense of purpose among young people; but, faced with the reality of these trends, colleges have not changed their models nearly enough to help students build purpose, confidence, agency, and maturity. 
Second, colleges are not doing enough to build “durable” or “transferable” skills and the networks and experiences students need to transition successfully from high school to 21st century careers that pay good wages.  
There is a striking gap between what students and college administrators think students have learned and can do, and what employers think students can do, particularly in vital areas such as communication, critical thinking, professionalism, and leadership. For example, 81 percent of recent graduates feel they are adept at critical thinking, while only 56 percent of employers agree. Seventy-eight percent of new graduates say they are proficient at communication, while only 54 percent of employers agree. 
Third, colleges cost too much. While many colleges and degrees still provide a great return on investment, many do not. Over the last 80 years, the relative portion of college costs borne by students/families, philanthropy, and the public sector has gone up and down, but the actual cost of delivering a year of college has risen sharply — at about four times the rate of inflation. 
The cost today of delivering a year of college education (not including research expenses, housing, etc.) at a four-year institution ranges from approximately $25,000 to $40,000,   compared to the average cost per student of delivering a year of K-12 education of about $16,000. And this is true even though K-12 students are in class for about 950 hours a year and college students are in class for about 350 hours a year. 
After a career spent mostly in K-12 education, for the last decade I have partnered closely with 20 different four-year colleges and universities, including public and private, large and small, selective and not selective. Each of these institutions offer strong programs backed by committed faculty and staff. But none is doing nearly enough to address the root causes of this trio of crises – a crisis of purpose, a crisis of skills, and a crisis of cost.  
The result is that American young people and their families are voting with their feet (the percentage of high school graduates choosing to enroll in college has declined from 70 percent in 2009 to 61 percent in 2023) and Americans of all ages are sharing their opinions about college, including at the ballot box.  
According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans expressing “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in higher education declined from 58 to 36 percent over the last 10 years while the percent expressing “very little” or “no” confidence shot up from 10 to 32 percent. 
So what should be done? And how can Massachusetts – home to America’s first public school (Boston Latin), first university (Harvard), and one of the greatest concentrations of colleges (104 colleges in a state of 7 million residents) – lead the way? 
I believe we need fundamentally new models for teaching and learning and that the new models need to break the monopoly of “sage on the stage” teaching and lean into an experiential learning revolution – a dramatic increase in real-world, apprenticeship-based, internship-based, and work-based learning.  We need to get students out of the classroom and out into the community.  
When I was in college, I learned a lot from some very sagacious professors who lectured and led discussions in their area of expertise. But I learned much more from job and internship experiences out in the real world. My experience is not an outlier. A survey sponsored by Hult International Business School reported that 77 percent of young people entering business careers said they learned more in their first six months of work after college than they did in four years of college. Why not make college more like those first six months of work? 
To be clear, I don’t think the purpose of college is just to prepare young people for work. And I do think an important role remains for “sage on the stage” instruction, including lectures, guided discussions, and liberal arts inquiry led by skilled professors. The purpose of college should include preparation for work, but also preparation of young people for a life of purpose, a life of civic leadership, and a life of critical thinking and action as citizens in a democracy, and as family and community members. 
What are some new college models that could point the way forward – and that could address the three crises of purpose, skills, and cost? 

A whole new type of college – an apprenticeship college – where half the credit comes from purposeful work with special projects, guided challenges, reflection, mentorship, and more. Reach University is piloting this approach with future teachers and public health workers, and College for Social Innovation, the nonprofit I lead, is exploring the creation of a two-year public service college built around four immersive public service internships as well as related courses in problem solving, human centered design, and communication. History credits can come from studying the history of social change movements in Boston and math credits from diving deep on the use of data to explain the successes and challenges of various social impact strategies. But the internships themselves – packed with research, project management, independent learning, and mentorship – need to be credited too. 


A whole new type of college that is organized around missions, not majors, and that includes deep Outward Bound-type experiences at launch, at least two immersive high-impact learning semesters that offer learning primarily outside of the traditional classroom (with full academic credit), and a requirement that every student complete a capstone project that connects to their personal and professional mission. Colleges built around mission and purpose can build from an emerging network of “microcolleges” such as Deep Springs College in Nevada, Thoreau College in Wisconsin, and the Seguinland Institute in Maine, all supported by Springboard, a nonprofit designed to research and support small and purpose-driven learning communities. 


A whole new type of college that marries AmeriCorps or other intense and well-scaffolded service experiences with deep mentoring and low-cost distance learning taken at whatever pace is desired by the learner — with degrees earned over two years or over 10 years. This model can build on the work at Boston-based nonprofit Duet, which in partnership with Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) enrolls low-income students to work toward associate or bachelor’s degrees, using just half of their Pell grant to pay for classes at SNHU and the other half to pay for intensive mentoring and personalized coaching from Duet.  

The dramatic changes we need will require new and disruptive innovations – new “microcolleges” with the freedom to invent new approaches to higher education. But I also believe that many of New England’s current public and private universities have the potential to pivot and to build on the many superb things they are already doing while also adding substantially more real-world learning with substantially more rigorous assessment of that learning. The recent effort across Massachusetts public universities to dramatically expand work-based learning programs, supported by the Axim Collaborative, is a good start.  
The challenge is to move immersive, experiential learning from the sidelines to the center and from extracurricular to curricular. A related challenge is to measure learning much more robustly in a way that marries the mastery of competencies such as storytelling, data visualization, human-centered research and design, and project management with credits and credentials.  
In the future workforce, jobs that require simple research and even powerful regurgitation will be done by AI, by robots, or by low-wage labor from other countries. Great jobs will still exist, but they will require the type of nimble problem solving that can only be learned through real-world practice and experience. Colleges need to realize that what the students are learning today is not enough anymore. 
Our goal must be nothing less than a bottom-up rethinking of that period between high school and adulthood that finds new ways to build confidence and purpose, new ways to build skills and networks, and that does it for an affordable price.  
I often refer to Boston as “the Silicon Valley of social innovation,” and that description has been well earned over the centuries. Now we face a new crisis around the declining efficacy of one of those innovations – higher education – and we need to lead the nation again, in an experiential learning revolution – a set of solutions that help more young people become the leaders we need and the fulfilled adults they want to become.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-01 17:05:54+00:00,Mississippi Today,Uncertainty over federal food aid deepens as the shutdown fight reaches a crisis point,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/01/uncertainty-over-federal-food-aid-deepens-shutdown-fight-reaches-crisis/,Crises at the heart of the government shutdown were in focus as the federal food assistance program faced delays and millions of Americans were set to see a dramatic rise in their health insurance bills.,"WASHINGTON — The crises at the heart of the government shutdown fight in Washington were coming to a head Saturday as the federal food assistance program faced delays and millions of Americans were set to see a dramatic rise in their health insurance bills.
The impacts on basic needs — food and medical care — underscored how the impasse is hitting homes across the United States. Plans by the Trump administration to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on Saturday were halted by federal judges, but the delay in payouts will still likely leave millions of people short on their grocery bills.
It all added to the strain on the country, with a month of missed paychecks for federal workers and growing air travel delays. The shutdown is already the second longest in history and entered its second month on Saturday, yet there was little urgency in Washington to end it. Lawmakers are away from Capitol Hill and both parties are entrenched in their positions.
The House has not met for legislative business in more than six weeks, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., closed his chamber for the weekend after bipartisan talks failed to achieve significant progress.
Thune said he is hoping “the pressure starts to intensify, and the consequences of keeping the government shut down become even more real for everybody that they will express, hopefully new interest in trying to come up with a path forward.”
The stalemate appears increasingly unsustainable as Republican President Donald Trump demands action and Democratic leaders warn that an uproar over rising health insurance costs will force Congress to act.
“This weekend, Americans face a health care crisis unprecedented in modern times,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said this week.
Delays and uncertainty around SNAP
The Department of Agriculture planned to withhold payments to the food program starting on Saturday until two federal judges ordered the administration to make them. Trump said he would provide the money but wanted more legal direction from the court, which will not happen until Monday.
Benefits were already facing delays because it takes a week or more to load SNAP cards in many states.
“People are just nervous, scared,” said Jill Corbin, the director of the St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen and food pantry in Norwich, Connecticut. ”It’s not really a definite answer that we have right now.”
As people lined up early Saturday for hot meals and groceries, the Connecticut organization had 10 extra volunteers to help newcomers navigate the process. On Wednesday, some 400 families visited the food pantry and 555 people received hot meals.
“It’s kind of like everything is unraveling at the same time,” Corbin said. “I’m not going to lie. It is challenging.”
The SNAP program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and costs about $8 billion per month. The judges agreed that the USDA needed to at least tap a contingency fund of about $5 billion to keep the program running. But that left some uncertainty about whether the department would use additional money or only provide partial benefits for the month.
“The Trump administration needs to follow the law and fix this problem immediately by working closely with states to get nutritional assistance to the millions who rely on it as soon as possible,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said in a statement following the ruling.
Democrats demanded this week that the government fund SNAP, but Republicans responded by arguing the program is in such a dire situation because Democrats have repeatedly voted against a short-term government funding bill.
“We are now reaching a breaking point thanks to Democrats voting no on government funding, now 14 different times,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at a news conference Friday.
Trump injected himself into the debate late Thursday by suggesting that Republican senators, who hold the majority, end the shutdown by getting rid of the filibuster rules that prevent most legislation from advancing unless it has the support of at least 60 senators. Democrats have used the filibuster to block a funding bill in the Senate for weeks.
Republican leaders quickly rejected Trump’s idea, but the discussion showed how desperate the fight has become.
Health care subsidies expiring
The annual sign-up period for the Affordable Care Act health insurance also begins Saturday, and there are sharp increases in what people are paying for coverage. Enhanced tax credits that help most enrollees pay for the health plans are set to expire next year.
Democrats have rallied around a push to extend those credits and have refused to vote for government funding legislation until Congress acts.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., spoke on the Senate floor this week about constituents who she said face premium increases of up to $2,000 a month if the credits expire.
“I am hearing from families in my state today who are panicked,” she said. “The time to act is now.”
If Congress does not extend the credits, subsidized enrollees will face cost increases of about 114%, or more than $1,000 per year, on average, health care research nonprofit KFF found.
In the days before the start of open enrollment, Democratic officials across the country warned that the cost increases would hit their constituents hard.
In Wisconsin, for example, families on the ACA’s silver plan could see premium increases of roughly $12,500 to $24,500 annually depending on their location. Sixty-year-old couples could face increases ranging from nearly $19,900 to $33,150 annually.
“No matter what the percentage is, it’s a hell of a lot,” Gov. Tony Evers, D-Wis., said.
Some Republicans in Congress have been open to the idea of extending the subsidies, but they also want to make major changes to the health overhaul enacted while Democrat Barack Obama was president. Thune has offered Democrats a vote on extending the benefits, but has not guaranteed a result. And he is demanding that Democrats first vote to reopen the government.
So the country waits and watches for Congress to act.
T.J. McCuin, whose family owns and operates farmers markets in Mesa and Apache Junction, Arizona, said 15% of the markets’ customers use SNAP benefits. He was not assuming the delays would immediately hurt the business, but added, “Hopefully this isn’t a long-term problem because once those benefits run out, then it’s going to start to hurt.”

(Photo by Clisby/Daily Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)​Martha Layne Collins, who as the only woman to serve as governor of Kentucky revolutionized the state’s economy by landing Toyota Motor Manufacturing, died at 3 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 1, in Lexington. She was 88.
Her husband, Dr. Bill Collins, said his wife died in her sleep at Richmond Place, a retirement community in Lexington where they have been living. 
“I was with her. We had a lady for hospice, and caregivers came in and out. She died peacefully. She lived a remarkable life,” he said.
Her remarkable life began with her birth in Shelby County on Dec. 7, 1936. She served as governor from 1983 to 1987, when Kentucky governors were limited to one term.  
Collins was considered a candidate in 1984 for vice president of the United States as a running mate with Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, who instead chose Geraldine Ferraro.
Collins was elected lieutenant governor in 1979 and served simultaneously with Democratic Gov. John Y. Brown Jr.  
Collins got off to a rocky start as governor but after the first two years excelled, using economic incentives to bring Japanese automaker Toyota’s largest manufacturing plant to Georgetown in 1986, a development that remains an economic mainstay in Kentucky.  
Collins also successfully pushed for improvements in education. In June 1985 she unveiled a package that raised teachers’ salaries by 5%, reduced class sizes, funded construction projects, provided aides in kindergarten classrooms and helped find more money for poorer school districts. 
After leaving office, she was president of St. Catharine College in Springfield from 1990 to 1996 and later taught leadership classes at the Harvard Institute of Politics’ John F. Kenedy School of Government.
Dr. Collins said their children, Steve and Marla, will decide arrangements.  Steve is director of Hall-Taylor Funeral Home in downtown Shelbyville, which his grandfather, Martha Layne’s father, Everett Hall, operated.

(Photo by Minh Ha/Verite News)The Federal Communications Commission voted Tuesday to loosen regulations set just last year that would have significantly reduced the rates that prisoners, jail detainees and their loved ones pay to keep in touch.
In July 2024, the FCC passed its first cap on rates that prisons and jails — along with their telecommunications contractors — can charge inmates to make audio calls. The rule, originally scheduled to take effect at the beginning of this year, set the rate at 6 cents per minute for a 15-minute call for large jails and prisons, far below the rates that most people were paying in Louisiana, where some parish jails were charging as much as 25 cents per minute, according to a 2022 report by the Prison Policy Initiative.
Criminal justice reform advocates, including Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson, who runs New Orleans’ jail, have argued that high call rates stretch family budgets and prohibit the type of connectivity that studies show is beneficial to incarcerated people and their families.

Still, for decades people behind bars and their loved ones have been forced to pay exorbitant rates to stay in touch, while telecommunications companies and facility operators have traditionally split the revenue they made from enforcing high rates.
Hutson, who will step down in May after losing her reelection bid this month secured a new contract that offers one free 15-minute phone call per day and one free 20-minute video call per week to jail detainees.
Neither Hutson, nor Sheriff-elect Michelle Woodfork immediately responded to requests for comment from Verite News.
In 2023, Congress granted the FCC the authority to regulate phone rates and in 2024 it voted unanimously to significantly limit the amount that telecommunications companies and the facilities that they provide service to can charge for calls.
But the rule never took full effect. State prison systems and local jails, such as the New Orleans city jail, that had active contracts with telecommunications providers were given a one-year grace period to adjust their rates. And then, in June of this year, the FCC announced that the caps would be delayed until April 2027.
Thursday’s vote, meanwhile, nearly doubles the 2024 cap for some institutions. The new interim rates raise the maximum cost of phone calls with people inside prisons from 6 cents per minute to 11 cents per minute. Rates for large jails, like the Orleans Justice Center, defined as holding 1,000 or more residents, are now capped at 10 cents per minute for phone calls. Rates for medium to very small jails range from 11 to 18 cents per minute. Under the previously agreed upon rules, those rates were capped at between 7 and 12 cents per minute.
The new rates include a two-cent-per-minute added fee that would go to the jails and prisons for “correctional facilities’ expenses.” The temporary regulations continue to prohibit fees known as “site commissions” — a percentage of the per-minute calls that is shared with facility operators, such as sheriff’s offices — and other ancillary fees, associated with setting up an account to make phone calls.
Women need earlier intervention in the criminal justice system, report suggests

The change in rate caps appears to be a response to concerns raised by telecommunications companies that the 6 cents per minute limit did not cover the costs of security measures — like surveillance of calls — associated with providing service in prisons and jails. FCC members said the 2024 rules had resulted in some jails ceasing to provide telecommunications services at all.
In a meeting on Zoom on Monday, prison phone justice advocates representing Worth Rises and the United Church of Christ Media Justice Ministry said that only one small jail, in Baxter Country, Arkansas, had opted to end telecommunications services in retaliation against the lowered rate caps.
Criminal justice reform advocates at Louisiana nonprofit the Promise of Justice Initiative have been campaigning to convince the state Department of Corrections and local sheriffs to reduce the cost of phone calls for detainees and their loved ones to zero. Hardell Ward, director of community impact for the organization, said the FCC is backpedaling and going against what Congress and voters want to benefit telecommunications companies.
Ward noted that Securus, one of the the largest prison and jail telecommunications companies in the United States, is owned by Tom Gores, owner of the Detroit Pistons, through his private equity firm Platinum Equity. Securus provides phone services for Louisiana state prisons and a number of parish jails. (The New Orleans jail uses a different contractor.)
“Louisiana pays for the Detroit Pistons,” Ward said.
A representative for Securus’ parent company Aventiv did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the rate changes from Verite News.
Ward said that lower call rates keep incarcerated people more connected with their loved ones on the outside, which in turn keeps them happier and makes the prisons and jails safer.
“When you deny that connection, you’re putting guards who have to manage that facility in the line of fire. You’re taxing the resources of sheriffs,” Ward said.
Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, a Shreveport Democrat who represents north Louisiana on the commission — which regulates telecommunications companies for the state —  has long criticized rates for phone calls with incarcerated people. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Campbell said he is against the less restrictive rate limits.
“We have the highest rate of incarceration in the country and the poorest people,” Campbell said. “It all circles around one word – greed. If you gave [the telecommunications companies] 6 cents, they’d want 10 and if you gave ‘em 10, they’d want 15 and then 20.”
The Louisiana Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Verite News.
Federal Communications Commission member Anna Gomez, a Biden administration appointee and the only commissioner who voted against the rate cap increases, opened her remarks by calling the move to increase rate limits for prison and jail calls “indefensible.” The other two commissioners, Olivia Trusty and Chairman Brendan Carr, were both appointed by President Donald Trump.
“[Adopting the new rules] implements an egregious transfer of wealth from families in incredibly vulnerable situations to greedy monopoly companies,” Gomez said, noting that people with loved ones behind bars are saddled with the difficult choice of paying the high rates or losing their connections. “Families have no option but to pay the higher rates, regardless of whether they have enough to make rent, buy groceries or pay the electric bill.”
Trusty, who joined the commission this year, noted that telecommunications companies that provide phone service in prisons operate at an advantage because their customers can’t sign up with a competing firm. But she said the high costs of safety and security measures, like recording and monitoring phone calls, unique to providing service to carceral facilities, must also be considered.
Before the vote, Carr noted that changes to rate caps of prison and jail communications have resulted in multiple lawsuits. In November Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and the Louisiana Sheriff’s Association sued the FCC in opposition to the 6 cent rate cap.
Carr laughed at an audible “boo” that came from a member of the audience when he entered the deciding vote to approve the new rate caps.

(Photo courtesy of Great Plains Food Bank)The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Spirit Lake Nation and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa have enacted emergency plans as they prepare for interruptions to federal nutrition and fuel programs come November.
“These are things that were thrown on us knowing damn well that we are going into our winter months,” Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chair Jamie Azure said during a Thursday morning tribal council meeting. “This is a literal life and death situation for a lot of people.”
Tribal governments are tapping into their own resources to help their communities weather the shutdown, which started Oct. 1 after Congress failed to adopt a budget.
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa on Thursday announced it will deploy over $1 million to help fill in some of the service gaps. That includes $500,000 for food vouchers, $500,000 in fuel assistance, $40,000 to a community soup kitchen, $50,000 for a senior meal program, $100,000 for a school backpack nutrition program and $40,000 for meals at Turtle Mountain College, the tribal council said during the meeting.
Native communities scramble to provide food with SNAP, WIC cutoffs looming

“We probably won’t feel a major impact for a few weeks into November, but it was important that we exhausted every avenue before we got to this point,” Azure said.
He said the tribe doesn’t expect the federal government to reimburse it for any of the expenses after it reopens.
Tribal governments are also encouraging members enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to switch to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Distribution Program, which provides food to low-income households living on reservations. Some Native American households living near reservations can also participate in the program.
The Spirit Lake Nation informed its members they had to close their SNAP account by Tuesday in order to be eligible for the Food Distribution Program for November.

Rep. Collette Brown, a Warwick Democrat and Spirit Lake Nation citizen, said Thursday that the tribe is worried about how to get food and supplies in the hands of members without reliable transportation.  
She said the Food Distribution Program offers healthy options and enrollees typically get more food per month compared to SNAP, but that it is less convenient since it requires people to pick up boxes in person at distribution centers.
Brown said the Spirit Lake Nation may establish a food voucher program for its grocery store, though the tribal government hasn’t decided yet.
“They’re still thinking it over, trying to identify where we can get funds,” she said.
Brown said the tribe will do whatever it can to keep its citizens warm and fed during the winter. They have firefighters splitting wood for fuel, and may also bring in hunters to help process game, she said.
In an Oct. 23 statement, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chair Steve Sitting Bear criticized the shutdown and its effect on federal programs as a violation of the federal government’s duty to tribes.
“Congress, your citizens need you to come together,” Sitting Bear said in the statement. “Our tribal nations need you to fulfill your promises and obligations written in treaties and trust agreements. The consequences of your divisive political rhetoric are putting unneeded stress on your countrymen and women.” 
A state of emergency declaration adopted by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe authorized the tribal council to use emergency funds to support social services during the shutdown.
The declaration notes that the tribe has more than 2,300 monthly participants in SNAP, about half of which are children. It has about 200 participants in the Women, Infants and Children Program, and about 900 participants in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program during the winter.
Leaders of Turtle Mountain, Standing Rock and Spirit Lake, along with the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate and Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation adopted a joint resolution on Oct. 23 calling on the state to support the continuation of services like SNAP and the Women, Infants and Children Program during the shutdown.
“I grew up on these programs, and I know firsthand how critical they are for families working hard to make ends meet,” Rep. Lisa Finley-Deville, a Mandaree Democrat and citizen of the MHA Nation, said in a statement announcing the resolution.
The MHA Nation in a Thursday statement to the North Dakota Monitor said it has not declared a state of emergency, but is coordinating with food distribution organizations to address food insecurity during the shutdown.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Thursday announced the state is using $1.5 million in general funds from the Department of Health and Human Services to go toward the Great Plains Food Bank and to sustain the Women, Infants and Children Program through the month of November.
“In my talks with the Governor’s staff this morning, each tribe will receive a truckload of food,” Rep. Jayme Davis, a Rolette Democrat and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa member, said in a Thursday Facebook post. She wrote that Turtle Mountain and Spirit Lake’s deliveries are expected Nov. 5.

(Camera trap photo by Bryan White/USFWS)Craig Sweet, president of Iowa Trappers Association, is set to begin his 53rd season fur trapping this fall, just as soon as he gets the rest of his crops out of the field. 
According to Iowa Department of Natural Resources, furbearer season, which begins Saturday in Iowa, has had an “uptick” in interest due, in part, to workshops led by Iowa Trappers Association. 
Sweet said the more than six-decade-old organization has always held trapper workshops, but has started to hold more beginner-friendly classes in regions across the state.
The result, according to Sweet, has been a diverse crowd -– men, women, “oldsters and youngsters” — interested in learning how to trap. He said most attendees are interested in trapping because they have fur-bearing critters causing problems on their properties. 
“A lot of it is coming from people that are owning property and are wanting to control populations on their property for nest raiders and stuff like that,” Sweet said.

There are 14 furbearer species that Iowans can hunt or trap from Nov. 1 through Feb. 28: raccoon, muskrat, coyote, red fox, gray fox, beaver, mink, opossum, badger, spotted skunk, striped skunk, weasel, river otter and bobcat. Beaver season, according to DNR, extends until April 15. 
Sweet said he traps “everything that’s harvestable” in Iowa. Many of these critters, he said, are also viewed as a nuisance because they can cause damage to crops, gardens or livestock. 
The Iowa Trappers Association also has a series of publicly available videos on YouTube that detail basic trap setups and more advanced sets.
Historically, fur trapping was a profitable industry in Iowa. According to reports from DNR, species like beavers were so desirable at one point that the populations were almost decimated in the state.
 Throughout the decades, various pelts were more desirable than others, depending on fashion trends. Skunk, for example was frequently warn by movie stars in the early 1900s until the 1930s, which led to a spike in skunk fur trade.

In the late decades of the 20th century, anti-fur harvest groups, a drought and weak global fur market led to a “crash” in furbearer harvests in Iowa. 
DNR reported harvest trends have remained low since. While still low, harvest numbers increased to nearly 92,000 in the 2023-2024 season, which was up from around 65,600 the year prior. 
Since 2020, roughly 15,000 Iowans participate in fur harvest season each year. 
Vince Evelsizer, a DNR biologist specializing in furbearers and wetlands, said species populations for the upcoming season are in “good shape.” Evelsizer said most species are trending higher except for gray fox populations.
Muskrat populations have historically been tied to season precipitation amounts, as the slinky rodents live in marshes and wetlands, but DNR’s trends in furbearers report said overall populations have been declining since the late 1980s. 
Evelsizer said water levels in streams, marshes and rivers are better this year than last year, which might mean there are higher muskrat populations. 
“A lot of north Iowa marshes have water in them, which bodes well for species like muskrats, and the weather outlook is favorable heading into the first two weeks of the season,” Evelsizer said in a news release with DNR. “We’re not expecting freeze up for water trappers.” 
Evelsizer said fur prices this year are similar to last year, with a slight uptick in badgers, wild mink and striped skunk pelts.
Sweet said most trappers participate in the sport for fun, or to control animal populations, rather than to make money on the fur. 
“With the current markets, you got to do it because you like it,” Sweet said. “Because in the long run, you’re going to end up losing money.”
Sweet said he tans some of the pelts he harvests to hang on his walls or to give away at Iowa Trappers Association events. 
Furbearer hunting and trapping season begins Saturday, and Evelsizer encouraged prospective trappers to review regulations and to have a “safe trapping season.”

Campbell plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The Trump administration’s emergency order to keep the huge J.H. Campbell coal plant on Lake Michigan operating past its planned retirement date has cost at least $80 million since May, its operator, Consumers Energy, told regulators and investors this week.
The company said in its third-quarter earnings report Thursday that it would pursue the process laid out in the U.S. Department of Energy’s order for collecting those costs: It will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest.
Even though the peak summer electricity demand season has passed, executives at Consumers, Michigan’s largest energy provider, said that they see no sign of let-up in the emergency orders.
“We expect those to continue for the long-term,” said CEO Garrick Rochow in a conference call for investors. “And we’re prepared to continue to operate the plant and comply with those orders.”
He said the costs—$615,385 per day—should be shared beyond the 1.9 million electricity customers of Consumers Energy. The company plans to propose the tab be split among ratepayers (an estimated 42 million to 45 million electricity customers) in the nine states served by the regional electric grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).
“The benefits go to MISO,” Rochow said. “Not just to our customers, they go to MISO.”
Rochow said the Trump administration envisioned this approach. “That order from the Department of Energy has laid out a clear path to cost recovery,” he said. Consumers Energy will have to apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in order to pass the costs to the ratepayers, and states that oppose such a cost allocation could move to intervene in those proceedings.
U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued two consecutive 90-day orders—on May 23 and on Aug. 20—to keep the Campbell plant open under the emergency provisions of the Federal Power Act. In the past, such orders have been used to ensure energy delivery at times of natural disasters. But Wright used the act to execute Trump’s agenda to ramp up energy production, saying Campbell needed to stay open to minimize the risk of power outages and address critical grid security issues in the Midwest.
The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Campbell cost figures, nor did MISO. When he extended the Campbell order in August, Wright said that he was directing MISO “to take every step to minimize cost to the American people.”
“This order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power,” he said in that statement.
But critics say the operation of the 63-year-old plant is generating unnecessary costs as well as pollution. In a September regulatory filing challenging the DOE’s order, a coalition of environmental groups pointed out that even on the day of highest peak demand this summer, MISO had an unused surplus of resources greater than 10 times the power provided by the Campbell plant.
And indeed, according to recent Environmental Protection Agency data, two of the three units at the Campbell plant were not operating at all for about 30 days of the 131 days from the start of the DOE order through Sept. 30. The third unit at the plant only ran for 18 days. Such stoppages could occur for maintenance or simply because the grid operator did not call on the plant to deliver energy to the grid.
“Forcing this unnecessary coal plant to keep operating is bilking consumers for the benefit of the coal industry,” said Michael Lenoff, senior attorney for Earthjustice, which is representing the environmental groups.
Because DOE did not respond to their petition for reconsideration of the Campbell order within 30 days, the environmental groups and the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois have asked the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case. The purpose of the litigation, Lenoff said, is “to stop the administration from harming consumers, trampling markets and unlawfully usurping the authority of states and regulators to make decisions in the public interest.”
Campbell is by far the largest of three fossil fuel electricity plants that are staying open beyond their planned retirements under Trump administration emergency orders. Campbell released 6.6 million metric tons of carbon in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. Talen Energy’s Wagner plant near Baltimore and Constellation Energy’s Eddystone plant just south of Philadelphia, both run on oil and natural gas. Some detail on their costs for keeping open may emerge next week, when Talen and Constellation report their third-quarter earnings.
Consumers Energy, which is continuing to work toward its previously stated goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, had projected that the retirement of the Campbell plant would save its customers $600 million over the next 20 years, or $30 million per year. Instead, running the plant for the past five months has cost close to three times that annual amount.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-1-1024x600.jpg,,,2025-11-01 09:16:48.517280

The field vying for one of the state’s two U.S. Senate seats grew recently with a candidate announcement by Justin McNeal, a Republican from Rapid City. His announcement sets up a potential June 2, 2026, primary race pitting him against incumbent Republican Sen. Mike Rounds.
McNeal said he is a Navy veteran and businessman who most recently founded Dakota BioChar, which aims to convert forest waste into material that can be spread on agricultural fields to improve soil health.

In his announcement, McNeal said the largest threat to the nation is its debt, and he pledged to work against what he described as the “unholy trinity”: special interests lobbying elected officials, who in turn receive campaign contributions from special interests.
“This system will never benefit ‘We the People,’” McNeal said.
At least two other people have announced their intention to seek Rounds’ Senate seat: Julian Beaudion, a businessman, community activist and Democrat from Sioux Falls, and Brian Bengs, a park ranger, Air Force veteran and independent from Hot Springs.
Johnson, Jackley have leads in polls
South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy at the University of South Dakota released poll results this week.
Their poll of registered Republican voters found U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson leading the race for the 2026 Republican nomination for governor. He polled at 28%, followed by Gov. Larry Rhoden at 27%, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden at 15% and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids, at 10%. Twenty-one percent of respondents were undecided.
The only declared Democratic candidate for governor so far is Robert Arnold, a college student. At least two independents have also publicly said they’ll run for governor: Allison Renville, a Lakota activist and member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, and Terry Gleason, a Chamberlain man.
In the race for the Republican nomination to succeed Johnson in the U.S. House, Attorney General Marty Jackley led the News Watch/Chiesman Center poll with 57% support, followed by Madison state Sen. Casey Crabtree at 5% and Piedmont businessman James Bialota at 2%. Thirty-six percent of respondents were undecided.
Announced U.S. House candidates on the Democratic side are former U.S. Department of Agriculture official Nikki Gronli, of Dell Rapids, and Sioux Falls nonprofit executive Billy Mawhiney. Scott Schlagel, a Democrat from Dell Rapids, has filed a statement of candidacy.
Campaign finance update
Rounds’ campaign begins with a big fundraising head start in the U.S. Senate race, according to campaign finance reports that include data through September.
His campaign committee came into the year with a balance of $1.9 million and raised $1.45 million while spending about $506,000, leaving a balance of $2.8 million. Beaudion launched his campaign this spring, bringing in about $146,000 since April and spending roughly $115,000, ending with about $31,000. Bengs, who also began his fundraising in April, raised about $155,000 and spent about $125,000, leaving a balance of about $30,000.

In the U.S. House race, Jackley raised about $526,000 since July and spent about $23,000, leaving him with about $503,000. Crabtree reported raising about $206,000 since July and spending about $25,000, ending with about $181,000.
On the Democratic side of the House race, Gronli reported raising about $23,000 since August and spending about $2,600, leaving her with about $21,000. Mawhiney reported raising about $17,000 since July and spending about $8,600, ending with about $8,500.
Candidates for state-level offices don’t have to report on their finances until January. Federal reports show that in the governor race, Johnson has about $6 million to bring over to his state-level campaign.
More candidate announcements
Attorney general: Jackley’s candidacy for the U.S. House creates an opening that McPherson County State’s Attorney Austin Hoffman hopes to fill; he recently announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination, joining at least one other Republican who announced previously, Lance Russell, the state’s attorney for Fall River and Oglala Lakota counties.

Amid the cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, exacerbated by the ongoing shutdown, advocates called on the state to take action. They said lawmakers should expand Medicaid, protect food assistance programs, create standardized paid parental leave, support midwives and doulas and invest in child care and early childhood education. 
Mississippi is one of the most dangerous places to give birth, especially for Black women, who are four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related deaths, or deaths that occur during pregnancy or up to one year postpartum and are caused in part by the pregnancy. A combination of poverty, chronic diseases, provider shortages and policies that have shut out tens of thousands of Mississippians from health care contribute to bad outcomes for mothers and babies. 
Now, cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs threaten to walk back progress that has been made over the years, speakers said Thursday at the state Capitol. 
In the past three years, the Mississippi Legislature passed laws to give women an additional 12 months of Medicaid coverage postpartum, timely prenatal care as they wait for their Medicaid applications to process and paid parental leave for state employees. 
Democratic lawmakers and advocates in Mississippi had hoped to build on those policies by passing laws to guarantee all workers paid parental leave, and to expand Medicaid to cover those who currently fall in the coverage gap – making too much to qualify for the state’s strict Medicaid income threshold but too little to qualify for subsidies that make Affordable Care Act  marketplace insurance more affordable. 
Now, they worry that even keeping the current policies from shrinking might be an impossible feat. 
“We are facing dramatic cuts to Medicaid through the Big Ugly Bill and Donald Trump and Congressional Republican members’ efforts to gut this lifesaving health care program that covers so many births in your state and across the country,” said U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois, one of the authors of “Momnibus” legislation aimed at addressing the Black maternal health crisis. Underwood attended the Mississippi event by video conference.
“To hear that you all are thinking about growing the workforce, investing in doulas, interested in taking a look at how to support community-based organizations and clinics across the state – these are the kinds of resources that our moms and our families need.”
Partisan disagreements over health care are at the center of the ongoing federal government shutdown. Democrats are fighting to renew Biden-era subsidies that are making health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans. If they are not renewed, premiums on  ACA marketplace insurance plans will more than double next year, KFF estimates. 
And it’s not just about having health insurance, Cassandra Welchlin of the Black Women’s Roundtable argued. Welchlin described a mother she knows who works at a diner making $10 an hour, has no paid leave and relies on others to transport her. She risked her job to attend prenatal visits and returned to work two weeks postpartum. 
“If you aren’t Danielle, you know Danielle,” Welchlin said of the mother. “It’s not just about the health care coverage but a string of policies that we have to co-create together in order to make strong babies and healthy moms.”

The federal budget bill signed into law by President Donald Trump over the summer includes the largest cuts to Medicaid and SNAP in history. The cuts to Medicaid are expected to trigger the downsizing of many rural hospitals – and labor and delivery units are often the first to go when hospital budgets shrink. 

Women in rural areas already have few options for giving birth. Half of Mississippi’s counties are maternity care deserts, and the state Health Department recently declared a public health emergency for the state’s infant mortality rate – the highest in the nation. 
Nobody knows that more than Shenelle Ball-Burks, whose pregnant daughter and unborn grandchild died in 2021 on the side of the road as her husband was driving her 28 minutes from their home to the closest hospital. 
“I come before you from Belzoni in Humphreys County, a place where our hearts are full but our health care is empty, a place where the difference between life and death can be measured not in miles but in minutes,” Ball-Burks said at the hearing. “I didn’t know what to say when I was asked to speak here today because how do you find words when your heart has been shattered? How do you strive after watching your child’s life fade because help was too far away?”
Ball-Burks said she worries for all the moms and babies who will continue to suffer as help becomes farther away through federal and state policy changes. 
“I don’t want another mother to hold her child’s obituary instead of her hand,” Ball-Burks said. “I don’t want another husband to kneel beside a little girl crying for help that never comes. I don’t want another child to walk across a graduation stage in search of a face that isn’t there.”
Research shows that when eligibility for social safety net programs is made stricter, women tend to lose the most. That’s partly because women more often participate in the programs – due to the wage gap and life events such as childbirth – but also because they are more often caregivers to those who use the programs.
“This is not just a statistic, not just someone else’s problem,” said Rep. Timaka James-Jones, a Democrat from Belzoni and the sister-in-law of Ball-Burks. “It’s a sacred responsibility. Because when we save our mothers, we don’t just save one life. We save families. We save our children’s futures. We save the heartbeat of our communities.”

Many of the legislators and health care providers who spoke about their experience living through or witnessing the statistics that put Mississippi at the bottom of nearly every list when it comes to the health of moms and babies. 
“Mississippi remains one of the hardest places in America to be pregnant and give birth, especially if you’re Black,” said Rep. Zakiya Summers, a Democrat from Jackson. “I speak to you not only as a legislator but as a Black mother who has carried life while carrying fear. Our survival should not be revolutionary. It should be standard.”
Women in rural communities don’t just suffer from a dearth of hospitals or obstetricians. They suffer from a dearth of reliable and affordable support in all forms, said Dr. Michelle Owens, maternal fetal medicine specialist in Jackson and the chair of the Mississippi Maternal Mortality Review Committee.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A recent legislative hearing left people involved in the state’s medical marijuana businesses paranoid, and it wasn’t because they had been sampling their own products.
A meeting of the Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee turned into an assault on the program that the state’s voters approved in 2020 and the state implemented in 2022. The roster of speakers was a travel agent’s dream come true with a law enforcement officer from Missouri, an emergency medicine doctor from Colorado, a professor from Oklahoma, an addiction specialist from Colorado and the Sioux Falls school superintendent.
All of them were on hand to warn against the evils of marijuana in general and in particular how those evils can flourish thanks to a medical marijuana program.
Emmett Reistroffer of Genesis Farms Cannabis Company in Sioux Falls said it looked like a concerted effort to restrict or repeal the state’s medical marijuana program. Rep. Josephine Garcia, a Watertown Republican and chairwoman of the committee, didn’t like Reistroffer’s conclusion.
In a South Dakota Searchlight story, Garcia said the meeting’s agenda was set “to follow what was not done when this program was first rolled out. That was my only intention here. If you’re insinuating that me, as the chair, have said something or orchestrated something, I have not done that. It is awareness for the public. This is a public safety issue.”

With Garcia’s Murderers’ Row of anti-marijuana speakers, it sure seems like an orchestrated effort. Or perhaps it’s the first salvo in a battle to overturn the will of the voters.
Those of us who can remember back to the 2020 election recall that the virtues and pitfalls of medical marijuana were pretty well litigated. In the end, voters chose to approve the program with 70% of the vote. Garcia’s excuse that these issues have never before been discussed shows a frightening lack of memory or a penchant for being disingenuous.
Those of us who can remember back as far as 2017 know why Reistroffer and his colleagues in the medical marijuana community are so upset. During the legislative session that year, it only took a few days for lawmakers to dismantle Initiated Measure 22, despite it being approved the previous November by South Dakotans with 52% of the vote.
Sold to voters as an anti-corruption measure, IM 22 was quite likely unconstitutional and its implementation had been halted by a judge. Lawmakers, however, weren’t content to let the case play out in court. Working at an unusually fast pace, it took just over a week for lawmakers to dismantle IM 22, implementing some parts of the measure via legislation while jettisoning others.
Oversight committee testimony sends ‘shock wave’ through SD medical marijuana industry

The ease with which legislative leaders explained away their disregard for the will of the voters has not been lost on the people who organize ballot questions. It was a ballot question that gave South Dakota its medical marijuana program.
In some cases, ballot initiative organizers have turned to state constitutional amendments rather than initiated laws because they know that it will be at least two years before lawmakers can put the issue back on the ballot. In the meantime, the Legislature can’t mess with a constitutional amendment the way they did with IM 22.
Whether Garcia likes it or not, marijuana dispensaries are part of the state’s medical community. It’s hard to imagine surgeons, chiropractors or nurses receiving such shoddy treatment at the hands of a legislative committee.
Anyone with an agenda that includes getting rid of the state’s medical marijuana program may find that there’s not much appetite for such a change. Abolishing the program would mean that all the licensing work done by local governments would be wasted. It would mean the shuttering of small businesses that were created in the wake of the 2020 election. It would mean a lack of relief for the 16,477 people who hold patient cards. It would mean once again overturning the will of the voters.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Voters across Washington will decide nearly 3,000 races in Tuesday’s election.
These include contests for city, county, school, fire district and court of appeals positions, along with one statewide ballot measure. In the state’s biggest city and county, that means deciding on the next Seattle mayor and King County executive.
There are also several competitive legislative elections that could signal how voters feel about decisions to raise taxes and pass contentious social policies this past legislative session. The outcomes in those races could skew, but not upend, the balance of power in Olympia going into 2026. 
To count, ballots must be returned to a drop box or voting center by 8 p.m. Tuesday. 
Voters can also drop their ballots in the mail, but they must be postmarked by Tuesday. 
Election officials had advised those looking to mail in their ballots to do so a week before Election Day, as the U.S. Postal Service may not postmark returned ballots on the day they’re first collected. 
With the election just days away, officials recommend using drop boxes, going to a voting center or visiting a Post Office location to turn in your ballot if you haven’t already.

The secretary of state maintains a map of Washington’s 554 ballot drop boxes. It’s also available in list form.
As of Thursday, about 14% of Washington’s registered voters had returned their ballots. Garfield, Columbia and Jefferson counties were leading the pack in terms of the share of voters who’d cast ballots, while Franklin, Grays Harbor and Clark counties were bringing up the rear.
This year’s turnout is so far lagging 2021, when about 40% of voters returned ballots.
Voters can register or update their information in person at an elections office before 8 p.m. Tuesday. Oct. 27 was the last day for online and mailed registrations. 
To track your ballot, visit voteWA.gov. 
What’s on the ballot?
Only one measure will appear on every ballot of the more than 5 million registered voters in Washington. 
Senate Joint Resolution 8201 is a question of whether to invest tax dollars collected for the state’s new long-term care program, known as WA Cares, in the stock market. This would be similar to how the state handles pension and retirement funds.
Currently, the collections for WA Cares are invested in more vanilla investments, like government bonds and certificates of deposit. 
Advocates of the constitutional amendment argue the stock market would lead to larger returns and keep premiums low. Opponents say it amounts to “gambling in the stock market” with taxpayer dollars.
A similar measure failed in 2020.
A slew of vacated seats in the state Legislature are also up for grabs. The most notable is in the 26th Legislative District, covering parts of Pierce and Kitsap Counties, where Democratic Sen. Deb Krishnadasan is looking to retain the seat against Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier.
This race in a purple district gives Republicans a rare chance to narrow the Democratic majority in the state Senate. 
Conservatives are also hoping for good news out of the 5th Legislative District in east King County. Former lawmaker Chad Magendanz is looking to unseat Democratic Sen. Victoria Hunt, who was appointed after the unexpected death of Sen. Bill Ramos earlier this year. Hunt won the primary comfortably. She was serving in the House before moving to the Senate.
A couple of Democrat-on-Democrat battles could also serve as a barometer of how voters feel about the more progressive turn the Legislature has taken in recent years.
State Rep. Amy Walen hopes to be a more moderate voice among Senate Democrats in her campaign against Sen. Vandana Slatter in the 48th Legislative District, representing parts of Redmond, Bellevue and Kirkland. Slatter led Walen handily in the August primary.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
And in the 33rd Legislative District, Burien Mayor Kevin Schilling is more of a centrist Democrat, while Rep. Edwin Obras this year followed the Democratic party line in voting for tax increases, a cap on residential rent increases and other controversial policies backed by progressives. 
Those four races are the ones to watch, but five other appointed Democratic lawmakers appear on Tuesday’s ballot. 
Democratic Eastside Reps. Janice Zahn and Osman Salahuddin are expected to sail to victory over Republican opponents. And state Sens. Tina Orwall, D-Des Moines, and Emily Alvarado, D-Seattle, as well as Rep. Brianna Thomas, are running opposed.
Snohomish County judges Tam Bui and Karen Moore are also vying for a seat on the state’s Division 1 Court of Appeals.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thurston-county-ballot-processing-1-1024x716.jpg,,,2025-11-01 07:17:06.902174

Oct. 30. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. UM Health-Sparrow and East Lansing Public Schools have opened a youth health clinic, open to all patients ages five to 21, based at East Lansing High School. 
This is the second youth health clinic in the region, following another in Grand Ledge that opened in April 2024. The clinic will have three staff members, according to Patrick Sustrich, a director of operations at UM Health-Sparrow — an advanced practice provider, a medical assistant, and a social worker. 
There is no requirement to be a student at East Lansing Public Schools to visit the clinic — anyone in the region within the age range is welcomed, and the clinic will be open year-round. A side entrance to the building, separate from the entrance to the school, makes that feasible. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“This on-site health center removes many of the barriers that families have faced,” said Dori Leyko, superintendent of East Lansing Public Schools. “No longer will students need to miss a day of school, or parents will need to take significant time off of work just to get a physical or see a clinician for minor illness.”

“With the clinic right here in our school community, care is more accessible, efficient and family friendly,” Leyko continued. “It removes transportation challenges, reduces missed class time and helps ensure students are healthy, ready and able to learn.”
“The biggest impact I think we can have is with mental health,” said Dr. Gregory Holzhei, a family physician at UM Health-Sparrow based in St. John’s. “Many of our students are suffering with mental health issues.”
Sustrich, said that in the first location, two-thirds of all visits to the clinic were related to mental and behavioral health concerns. 
He also mentioned specific programmatic services targeted towards students, including education around safe backpack weights — which he noted should not exceed 10% of a student’s weight. Another specific training, which the Grand Ledge clinic has done to help lower stress levels among new middle school students, teaches how to use combination locks. 
Leyko called the opening of the center the start of a “new chapter of care, connection and opportunity.”
Sustrich also noted that this clinic had room to grow, including adding more staff like a dietician or an exercise physiologist.
“You can see how this could just grow and morph into something much greater,” he said. “We’re still in our infancy and we’re not there yet, but the sky’s the limit.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Cue the crickets. 
That’s the sound you hear from Montana’s congressional delegation — Steve Daines, Tim Sheehy, Ryan Zinke, and Troy Downing — every time Donald Trump opens his mouth and lies about tariffs. You’d think one of them might clear their throat, tug on their cowboy boots, and say, “Excuse me, sir, but that’s not how tariffs work.” 
Instead, we get synchronized silence worthy of a barbershop quartet audition for “Spineless: The Musical.”
Here’s the truth Trump doesn’t want you to know (and apparently our delegation doesn’t have the nerve to explain): Tariffs aren’t paid by foreign countries. They’re taxes — on us. American consumers. Montana families. Small businesses. Farmers. You, me, and the guy trying to buy a new tractor part that now costs more than a used pickup.
Trump’s trade war has been a disaster for Montana agriculture. China stopped buying our soybeans, opting for Brazil’s instead. Prices are up, markets are down, and Montana farmers are left holding the bag — or, more accurately, the unsold bushel. And now Trump wants to fix his mess by importing more beef from Argentina. So, while our ranchers are struggling, he’s literally saying, “Let’s buy from Argentina instead.”
That’s not America First — that’s America Fumbled.
And what do we hear from Sens. Steve “Silent as a Stone” Daines, Tim “Trump’s Echo” Sheehy, and Representatives Ryan “Photo Op” Zinke and Troy “Copy-Paste Talking Points” Downing? Not a whisper. Not a peep. Just the faint hum of ambition and fear — fear of offending the Mar-a-Lago Monarch who pretends tariffs are like magic money falling from the sky.
If these four men were truly honoring their oaths of office, they’d be correcting the record, not cowering behind it. They’d tell their constituents that Trump’s tariffs are one of the largest tax increases on American consumers in history — following, of course, his massive tax cuts for the wealthy. The billionaires got their bonuses. The rest of us got higher prices, a lecture about patriotism, and a larger national deficit.  It’s obscene. 
Thanks, Trump. Your lies have economic consequences. And thanks to Montana’s delegation, they’re having political ones, too — or at least they should.
Montanans value honesty, integrity and straight talk. We can smell nonsense from miles away — usually right around campaign season. But when our so-called representatives choose silence over truth, that’s not loyalty; that’s cowardice in a cowboy hat.
Maybe Daines, Sheehy, Zinke, and Downing think silence is golden. In this case, it’s more like gilded cowardice — a shiny coating over an empty core. Their refusal to speak truth to Trump’s lies isn’t just embarrassing; it’s dangerous. Because every time they nod along, the lie grows stronger, the damage deeper, and the con thicker.
Montana deserves leaders who’ll call a lie a lie, even when it’s politically inconvenient. Leaders who understand that tariffs aren’t patriotic — they’re punishing. And that silence, no matter how polite or strategic, is still complicity.
So, here’s my humble suggestion: Next time Trump starts bragging about his “beautiful tariffs,” maybe our delegation could find the courage to whisper back, “Sir, those are taxes — on us.”
Until then, Montana’s Trump Choir can keep humming their favorite tune: “The Sound of Silence (and Surrender).”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/senaterepublicans-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-01 06:56:31.651930

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Justice Lindsey Miller-Lerman recalled a few pearls of wisdom she leaned on while ascending in her history-making role as the first woman appointed to the Nebraska Supreme Court. 
One guiding principle, passed along by her film editor son Jeremy came in handy while penning, participating or appearing in 5,832 career legal opinions: Don’t bore, don’t confuse.

Miller-Lerman bored few last year with an opinion in which she drew upon Patty and Selma of “The Simpsons” cartoon fame to make a serious point about separation of powers among government branches.
And there was no confusing her messages in dissents on rulings, including one that left the state immune from a lawsuit brought by three siblings for years of physical and sexual abuse while in foster care. 
Now, at age 78 — after serving six years as an inaugural judge on the Nebraska Court of Appeals and 27 years on the Nebraska Supreme Court — Miller-Lerman on Friday hung up her robe. 
The mother and grandmother of two said she approached her work with judicial “restraint,” careful to avoid politics and to not be too “frisky.” She enjoyed staying in touch with pop culture to connect with the masses and, when appropriate, drop a colorful reference into writings and conversations.
She believes she contributed to the “useful” role of a judge and takes pride in furthering the discussion of gender equality.
“When you look at the body of work, forget all the administrative stuff that eats up an enormous amount of time, I think you could say, intellectually, I was disciplined and didn’t have poor humor,” Miller-Lerman said in a sit-down interview with the Nebraska Examiner.

Her retirement follows what colleagues describe as a trailblazing run launched when a young West Coast swimming champion opted for a legal career and rose to partner status at a major Omaha law firm while working part-time raising two children. Then-Gov. Ben Nelson, the last Democrat to lead the state, named her in 1991 to the newly established appeals court, where she was the first woman to serve on a Nebraska court higher than the district court.
In 1998, he appointed her to the state’s highest court.
Nelson lauded the Miller-Lerman appointments as among his best, saying she was not “anxious to make law” but rather “has been steadfast with her resolve to find justice and to apply the law.”
Miller Lerman’s parting words at a courtroom retirement ceremony: “I took an oath, and I think I kept my promise.”
***
While packing up personal items from her chambers, located alongside other Supreme Court justice offices in a private section of the Nebraska Capitol, Miller-Lerman ran across career-spanning mementos.

There was a handwritten letter and drawing from a young visitor recounting her 1998 swearing-in ceremony. Of Miller-Lerman, little Hannah Hysack wrote: “She’s the first girl in Nebraska to be a Supreme Court judge.” Now an adult, Hysack showed up at the retirement open house, too.
The justice also kept a photo of a neighborhood youngster who, on one Halloween, donned a robe and carried a book, gavel and sign: “I’m Lindsey. I make the rules.”
Miller-Lerman said she’s never shied away from discussing gender inequities in the legal field and is pleased to have been in a position to be a role model for budding women attorneys — though she recognizes there’s a long way to go.
She referred to the recent history of the state Supreme Court, noting that of the last eight appointments since hers, one yielded a woman, sitting Justice Stephanie Stacy. 
“You be the judge,” quipped Miller-Lerman.
She pointed to a bathroom available for the Supreme Court in the Capitol that to this day she said has a wall lined with urinals and one stall. “Because justices are boys don’t you know?” she said with a sarcastic smile.

Miller-Lerman, while she requested no remodel, said she made clear from the start that she’d be using the facilities regardless. 
Carol Knoepfler, a professor at Creighton University School of Law, was Miller-Lerman’s former law clerk for eight years and shared anecdotes of how her former boss firmly yet courteously set the record straight on a woman’s place in high places. 
She recalled driving with Miller-Lerman to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for an oral arguments session when a security officer approached their car to say they could not park in the area, as it was reserved for the Nebraska Supreme Court.
Said Knoepfler: “I can still hear the judge reply in a very polite, but very precise manner, ‘How fortunate — because I am on the Nebraska Supreme Court.’”
At the same time during her career, Miller-Lerman said she tried to “eliminate the impediment that gender may have” so that “we move on to substance.”
She cited an interview with Nelson for the first judgeship, when she wore a Navy blue suit with yellow pin stripes and a yellow silk blouse, seeking to strike a balance: “business-like, traditional, but feminine.”
It’s similar to her style today, she said. “I haven’t bought into being like ‘the guys.’ That is my brand, I think.”
Colleagues talked of a competitive spirit, noting that as a teen she represented the U.S. in the 1961 Maccabiah games, winning three medals, two gold and a silver. She beat a teammate for one of the golds, who, according to Swimming World, went on to win a silver medal at the 1964 Olympics in that same event, and later set a world record. 
Miller-Lerman, after graduating from a California high school in 1963, went to Boston area Wellesley College and was on her legal track.
She said she felt fortunate to have role models such as Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was her professor at Columbia Law School and, later, the second woman on the U.S. Supreme Court. Miller-Lerman clerked for Constance Baker Motley, a civil rights legend and the first Black woman to be named a federal judge.

Former U.S. Rep. John J. Cavanaugh, D-Neb., who also spoke at the retirement event, recalled meeting Miller-Lerman in 1980 when he joined Omaha-based Kutak Rock law firm after his time on Capitol Hill. He saw her as a rising star litigator and said it was unheard of at the time for a part-time practicing lawyer raising children to become a partner in a major law firm.
He reflected on current “vigorous efforts to remove diversity, equity and inclusion” and celebrated that his colleague’s influence and opinions “will forever remain a part of Nebraska law and justice.”
“A small Sturgis bike riding Jewish girl from Los Angeles with an Ivy League education and a heart of gold and a head of steel principles … a permanent fixture in our history,” Cavanaugh said of Miller-Lerman.
*** 
Fans described her legal clarity and human charity.  
Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike Heavican, who served 18 years with Miller-Lerman until his retirement last year, noted her role in cases of “first impression,” those that present a novel issue not tackled before by that court.
He said she drafted the opinion that capital punishment judicial panels must be unanimous to impose a death penalty and another that decided same-sex partners had standing to seek custody and visitation of a child they co-parented.

Standing out also are Miller-Lerman’s “laser-focused” questions posed to attorneys during oral arguments, Heavican, an appointee of Republican Gov. Dave Heineman, said at the retirement event. He recalled her remark to those lawyers who tried to dodge: “That is the answer to a different question.”
Cavanaugh lauded Miller-Lerman’s dissenting voice in a series of sovereign immunity cases that he said continue to “haunt our state,” with the latest not allowing children abused while in state custody to seek public compensation or redress. 
He said courts and lawmakers have her written dissents to draw upon in future efforts to change law.
Perhaps her best-known opinion, said Miller-Lerman, is the 2007 State v. Winslow ruling, which allowed DNA testing for two of the “Beatrice Six” convicted in 1989 of a 1985 murder. The results showed neither had committed the crime. All six eventually were exonerated. 
They spent a combined 75 years in prison and won a $28 million wrongful conviction judgement.
A response she hadn’t expected, she said, came after referencing Patty and Selma of  The Simpsons in a concurrence when state officials tried to circumvent a state law that restored voting rights to felons who had completed their criminal sentences. The twin sisters of Marge Simpson she mentioned are cynical career employees at the Springfield DMV. 











Patty and Selma at the Department of Motor Vehicles may not be constitutional scholars, but they know they are expected to follow the law.


– Nebraska Supreme Court Justice Lindsey Miller-Lerman



Miller-Lerman opined: “Patty and Selma at the Department of Motor Vehicles may not be constitutional scholars, but they know they are expected to follow the law.”
She went on, “Do we want to live in a world where every state employee who has a hunch a statute is flawed gets to ignore it?”
The Simpsons bit was picked up by national publications and podcasts, but truth be told, Miller-Lerman expected a different part of the opinion to gain more traction. It read: “If the statutes were declared unconstitutional as urged by some members of the court, the elected officials would choose their voters instead of the other way around.”
“Who knew?” she asked.
*** 
Nebraska voters have retained Miller-Lerman in four judicial elections, and she was up for retention next year. But she was ready for less “court noise” and demand from the job she said she took very seriously.
Having survived breast cancer in her 30s, she said, she has sought to “maximize my contributions.”

“I feel I’ve made a contribution,” Miller-Lerman said. “I’m not sure more years is necessarily going to enhance that.”
Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke, appointed by Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, described her as a one-of-a-kind who enriched the Court. “Her legacy lives on, in all of our opinions.”
Upon her exit, Miller-Lerman said she had confidence that Nebraska’s Supreme Court won’t take the “easy wrong” and instead will “show the strength to demonstrate impartiality and justice.”
“In this time of instability, much depends on the strength and the authority of the courts,” said Miller-Lerman.
She plans to remain in Omaha, where her then-husband’s job first took the young family in 1975. Retirement allows more time with her grown children, Jeremy and Hannah, who live in other states. Still active and a gym-goer, Miller-Lerman is considering another level of service, including availability as a retired judge. 
“I’ll be useful,” she said.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer-Focht/Tennessee Lookout) There is a dangerous willingness among too many political, civil, and community leaders — and, anecdotally, far too many everyday citizens — to sacrifice civil and human rights on the altar of authoritarianism. It’s as if the mere mention of “crime” is enough to justify rolling back the very constitutional protections that are supposed to keep us safe.
This is exactly what has happened with the rollout of the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force initiative. From the beginning, its justification has leaned more on anecdotes than on actual data, relying on propaganda released by law enforcement agencies designed to reassert law-and-order politics every time a semblance of progressive criminal justice reform begins to take root. And disturbingly, it’s working.
The receipts are already here
We don’t have to speculate about what over-policing looks like in Memphis. We have the receipts. The 2024 United States Department of Justice pattern and practice investigation of the Memphis Police Department laid it out in black and white: MPD has engaged in unconstitutional policing tactics, including racial profiling and broken-windows policing, that disproportionately target Black communities. The DOJ made clear that these practices not only violate civil rights but also fail to reduce violent crime in any meaningful or sustained way.
In short, the report confirmed what many Memphians — especially Black Memphians — have long experienced: a system more invested in control than in safety. And now, instead of breaking with that harmful legacy, the Memphis Safe Task Force has doubled down on it by expanding the very practices the DOJ condemned.
Policing the public, not protecting it
This “task force” strategy has dramatically increased encounters between everyday citizens and law enforcement, primarily through racialized traffic stops. Citations are up. Arrests are up. But the violent crime numbers have not fallen at a rate commensurate with the manpower and resources the task force has touted. Available data shows that on one day alone, 51 individuals were arrested—and 37 of them were not charged with violent offenses, including seven for the civil offense of “unlawful presence.” These figures reveal a clearly misaligned strategy: diverting massive law-enforcement resources toward traffic stops and civil detentions while pursuing the claim of reducing violent crime.
Traffic citations outnumber federal task force’s arrests in Memphis; sparse data leaves impact murky

Even worse, transparency remains elusive. Many local outlets report that full arrest data is not publicly available. Meanwhile, multiple law enforcement agencies are routinely swarming the same traffic stops, improvising on the spot about which agency will take credit depending on what they “might” find. That’s not coordination. That’s chaos — and it borders on systemic Fourth Amendment violations through unreasonable searches and seizures.
A constitutional crisis, not a crime strategy
Let’s be honest: this isn’t just about crime. It’s about appeasing a convicted felon in the White House who has made a habit of bending, breaking and badgering the law to satisfy his own power-hungry, fascist impulses. What we’re witnessing is a local extension of a national project that normalizes state overreach and weaponizes fear.
Leaders like Memphis Mayor Paul Young have chosen compliance over courage, openly confirming that MPD is now working directly with ICE. This partnership has terrorized immigrant communities and further eroded public trust. It is not public safety. It is state-sanctioned overreach that tramples both the First Amendment’s protections for assembly and dissent and the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
Since this collaboration began, reports of federal enforcement activity have surged from a handful a day to hundreds each week, and nearly one in five arrests are now immigration-related, often involving nothing more than “unlawful presence.” This is not a targeted violent-crime strategy. It is the widening of a dragnet that places already marginalized communities in greater danger.
The cost of capitulation
When political leaders applaud superficial arrest numbers without interrogating what those numbers represent, they are applauding violations of civil and human rights. They are endorsing a two-tiered system where constitutional protections seem to apply fully only to white Americans. This is punitive populism in action: the exploitation of fear and punishment as a political performance, not a public safety strategy. This is not hypothetical; this is happening now.
As Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee recently stated, “we’ll figure things out along the way.” But “figuring things out” on the backs of Black and brown people is not governance. It’s experimentation with human lives. It’s dangerous. It’s unconstitutional. And it’s morally indefensible.
What real safety requires
Real safety is not built on surveillance, over-policing, or authoritarian force. It’s built on trust, transparency, and community investment. It’s built when the rights enshrined in the First and Fourth Amendments are protected instead of treated as collateral damage in a political spectacle of copaganda.
We should not, and cannot, accept an initiative that trades away constitutional rights for the illusion of security. If we care about safety, we must care just as fiercely about justice. Because the moment we normalize authoritarianism in the name of “safety,” none of us are safe at all.

The institution is unwilling to assert itself as an equal branch of government. (4X6, iStock/Getty Images Plus)Many Americans will be voting on Election Day — or have already cast votes — in races for statewide office, local positions and on ballot initiatives with major implications for democracy.
Congress is not on the ballot this November, but it will be in the 2026 midterms. A year from now, Americans in every state and district will get to vote for whom they want representing their interests in Washington.
But right now, Congress isn’t giving the American people much to go on.
As the shutdown of the federal government passes the one-month mark, the U.S. House of Representatives has been in recess for over 40 days. That’s the longest it’s ever stayed out of town outside of its typical summer recesses or the weeks leading up to their own elections.
Notably, the shutdown does not mean that Congress can’t meet. In fact, it must meet to end the shutdown legislatively. The Senate, for example, has taken votes recently on judicial nominations, a major defense authorization bill and a resolution on tariff policy.
Senators have also continued to hold bipartisan behind-the-scenes negotiations to end the shutdown impasse.
But with dwindling SNAP benefits, skyrocketing health care premiums and other major shutdown impacts beginning to set in, the House has all but abdicated its position as “The People’s Chamber.”
 
Long ‘path to irrelevance’
In addition to not meeting for any votes, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has refused to swear in Democratic U.S. Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Despite Johnson’s assurances, the shutdown does not prevent the House from meeting in a brief session to swear in Grijalva as a member for Arizona’s 7th District, which has been without representation since March.
Along with Casey Burgat and SoRelle Wyckoff Gaynor, I am co-author of a textbook, “Congress Explained: Representation and Lawmaking in the First Branch.” In that book, it was important to us to highlight Congress’ clear role as the preeminent lawmaking body in the federal government.
But throughout the shutdown battle, Congress — particularly the House of Representatives — has been unwilling to assert itself as an equal branch of government. Beyond policymaking, Congress has been content to hand over many of its core constitutional powers to the executive branch. As a Congress expert who loves the institution and profoundly respects its constitutionally mandated role, I have found this renunciation of responsibility difficult to watch.
And yet, Congress’ path to irrelevance as a body of government did not begin during the shutdown, or even in January 2025.
It is the result of decades of erosion that created a political culture in which Congress, the first branch of government listed in the Constitution, is relegated to second-class status.
 
The Constitution puts Congress first
The 18th-century framers of the Constitution viewed Congress as the foundation of republican governance, deliberately placing it first in Article 1 to underscore its primacy. Congress was assigned the pivotal tasks of lawmaking and budgeting because controlling government finances was seen as essential to limiting executive power and preventing abuses that the framers associated with monarchy.
Alternatively, a weak legislature and an imperial executive were precisely what many of the founders feared. With legislative authority in the hands of Congress, power would at least be decentralized among a wide variety of elected leaders from different parts of the country, each of whom would jealously guard their own local interests.
But Trump’s first 100 days turned the founders’ original vision on its head, leaving the “first branch” to play second fiddle.
Like most recent presidents, Trump came in with his party in control of the presidency, the House and the Senate. Yet despite the lawmaking power that this governing trifecta can bring, the Republican majorities in Congress have mostly been irrelevant to Trump’s agenda.
Instead, Congress has relied on Trump and the executive branch to make changes to federal policy and in many cases to reshape the federal government completely.
Trump has signed more than 210 executive orders, a pace faster than any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Republican Congress has shown little interest in pushing back on any of them. Trump has also aggressively reorganized, defunded or simply deleted entire agencies, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
These actions have been carried out even though Congress has a clear constitutional authority over the executive branch’s budget. And during the shutdown, Congress has shown little to no interest in reasserting its “power of the purse,” content instead to let the president decide which individuals and agencies receive funding, regardless of what Congress has prescribed.
 
Many causes, no easy solutions
There’s no one culprit but instead a collection of factors that have provided the ineffectual Congress of today.
One overriding factor is a process that has unfolded over the past 50 or more years called political nationalization. American politics have become increasingly centered on national issues, parties and figures rather than more local concerns or individuals.
This shift has elevated the importance of the president as the symbolic and practical leader of a national party agenda. Simultaneously, it weakens the role of individual members of Congress, who are now more likely to toe the party line than represent local interests.
As a result, voters focus more on presidential elections and less on congressional ones, granting the president greater influence and diminishing Congress’ independent authority.
The more Congress polarizes among its members on a party-line basis, the less the public is likely to trust the legitimacy of its opposition to a president. Instead, congressional pushback − sometimes as extreme as impeachment − can thus be written off not as principled or substantive but as partisan or politically motivated to a greater extent than ever before.
Congress has also been complicit in giving away its own power. Especially when dealing with a polarized Congress, presidents increasingly steer the ship in budget negotiations, which can lead to more local priorities — the ones Congress is supposed to represent — being ignored.
But rather than Congress staking out positions for itself, as it often did through the turn of the 21st century, political science research has shown that presidential positions on domestic policy increasingly dictate — and polarize — Congress’ own positions on policy that hasn’t traditionally been divisive, such as funding support for NASA. Congress’ positions on procedural issues, such as raising the debt ceiling or eliminating the filibuster, also increasingly depend not on bedrock principles but on who occupies the White House.
In the realm of foreign policy, Congress has all but abandoned its constitutional power to declare war, settling instead for “authorizations” of military force that the president wants to assert. These give the commander in chief wide latitude over war powers, and both Democratic and Republican presidents have been happy to retain that power. They have used these congressional approvals to engage in extended conflicts such as the Gulf War in the early 1990s and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan a decade later.
 
What’s lost with a weak Congress
Americans lose a lot when Congress hands over such drastic power to the executive branch.
When individual members of Congress from across the country take a back seat, their districts’ distinctly local problems are less likely to be addressed with the power and resources that Congress can bring to an issue. Important local perspectives on national issues fail to be represented in Congress.
Even members of the same political party represent districts with vastly different economies, demographics and geography. Members are supposed to keep this in mind when legislating on these issues, but presidential control over the process makes that difficult or even impossible.
Maybe more importantly, a weak Congress paired with what historian Arthur Schlesinger called the “Imperial Presidency” is a recipe for an unaccountable president, running wild without the constitutionally provided oversight and checks on power that the founders provided to the people through their representation by the first branch of government.

Brown/Maryland Matters)As Marylanders start to navigate the open enrollment period for health insurance, state officials are pointing out that higher costs aren’t the only changes that could trip people up.
“We encourage everybody to come back in and look at their plan, make sure the plan makes sense for your needs, for your family’s need,” Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, said in a webinar Friday on the changes on open enrollment this year.
The Marketplace Integrity Rule out of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the federal budget reconciliation bill, often referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” is bringing massive changes to health care.
But Eberle said that the expected expiration of popular federal tax credits for health care plans at the end of the year creates the “triple whammy” of factors that will jack up costs for some 300,000 Marylanders, which could lead to tough choices for some, including going without insurance.
While those federal policies bring in changes for the 2026 insurance year, not all will take effect right away. Here’s a run-down of what Marylanders can expect this open enrollment period, which runs from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, and in the future.
Costs going up
Maryland Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said that raised premiums will “continue to be a problem if Congress does not take decisive action to extend tax credits.”
The enhanced federal tax credit was created in 2021 to help more people afford health insurance during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, including Maryland’s congressional delegation have refused to vote a stopgap spending bill until Republicans agree to address the tax credits.
Health advocates, state officials brace for ‘sticker shock’ if ACA tax credits expire

“I’m a former head of the Medicare program,” Seshamani said. “I’m a physician. I’m also a mom. I’m a daughter — I know affordable and accessible health care is critical for us to protect.”
“We are in some very uncertain times,” said. “There’s a lot of headwinds to navigate, particularly with changes at the federal level, and we all see and appreciate the distress that this can cause for people in the health care system.”
Health care advocates say the credits brought more people into the insurance pool and helped keep premiums down.
For this year’s rate increase, insurance carriers asked for an average increase of 17.1%, accounting for the anticipated loss in enrollment if the tax credits expire. The Maryland Insurance Agency ultimately approved a 13.4% average rate increase, which applies to everyone on the health benefit exchange.
Some of the lower-income marketplace purchasers may be spared from the greatest premium hike this year. The General Assembly approved funding this past session that would partially replace the soon-to-expire federal tax credits for the upcoming year.
For the 2026 enrollment year, those state subsidies will be able to replace the extended tax credit for those under 200% of the federal poverty level. For those between 201% and up to 400%, the state subsidy will replace 50% of the value of the tax credits.
But the state’s fraught fiscal outlook means those state subsidies could be temporary, state officials say. Meanwhile, plenty of enrollees will see costs skyrocket.
“It’s a little bit better than losing that tax credit completely,” Eberle said. “For those who are over 400% of the federal poverty level, we are not able to do anything, so that will be a significant impact.”
DACA barred from marketplace
Some Marylanders will have a harder time accessing health care because of their immigration status.
The Marketplace Integrity Rule revoked a Biden-era decision that classified immigrants covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, as “lawfully present” individuals. Being lawfully present allowed DACA recipients, sometimes referred to as “dreamers,” access to the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange to shop for plans.
The last open enrollment period was the first time DACA recipients could use Maryland’s insurance marketplace. Without the classification, DACA recipients are again barred from the health insurance marketplace. That change took affect in August, affecting about 300 DACA recipients.
DACA recipients get access to state health care marketplace for the first time

Eberle also said that around 18,000 lawfully present immigrants with incomes lower than 100% of the federal poverty level will no longer be able to use tax credits that kept their health care costs down. They can still use the exchange to shop plans, but it will be more expensive.
She said that options are limited for DACA recipients and people who are not in the country legally because of the federal changes. She notes that the 2025 plans that people currently hold are still valid, and urges those who may lose coverage next year to take care of health needs now.
“We’re trying to encourage everyone to use their coverage,” she said. “If you need medical care now, go get it. Utilize your health benefits this year, and don’t put off things that you might have been putting off for next year.
What’s sticking around?
While much of the conversation around open enrollment involves increasing prices, Eberle noted that the state’s subsidy targeted for young adults is still in play, meaning that people aged 18-37 may still qualify for financial help that brings their monthly premiums down, which creates a healthier insurance pool.
In addition, some federal changes won’t take effect this year, meaning that Marylanders and state officials have some time to prepare for new hurdles in access to health care.
For example, Marylanders who don’t commit to a health care plan by the end of this year will still have a few weeks in January to determine what insurance best works for them.
That’s because this is the last year of an extended open enrollment window before federal policy shortens it.
Starting in the 2026 open enrollment year, people will have from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31 to commit to a new plan.
“That’s a big change,” Eberle said in an interview. “That’s not insurmountable. It’s just another barrier to coverage.”
Eberle says that with end-of-year travels and the holidays, many people struggle to deal with also shopping for insurance plans, so the extended enrollment window helps Marylanders enroll when things are a little more calm.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fortunately, Marylanders still have that extra time this year. Those who want coverage starting on Jan. 1 will need to commit to a plan by Dec. 31. Those who need a few extra days have until Jan 15, and their plans would begin Feb. 1.
She also said that another change coming down the line is the end of auto enrollment in coverage. Right now, if someone has a plan from the ACA marketplace and does not do anything with it, they are auto-renewed in the same plan if available.
In 2028, a new federal policy means that people will have to manually indicate that they want to continue coverage each year.
Eberle said that without auto enrollment, “if people are not aware of that and they let their coverage lapse, then they may not be eligible until the next year to get health coverage.”
While Maryland still has auto enrollment for the next two years, Eberle still urges everyone to take a look at their coverage and see if their plans are still the best for their household, especially considering a hike in premium costs.
“We’re in the open enrollment period and that’s what’s at the forefront right now,” Eberle said “We are encouraging everyone to come back and look at their plan selection.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2024_dec13_openenrollment-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-01 04:16:32.118217

(Photo via State Archives of Florida)The white political elite in America – politicians, judges, lawyers, policymakers, businesses and corporations – has never as a whole acted in good faith towards its Black citizens. These “leaders” routinely moved electoral goalposts, added impediments to gum up the voting process, made promises they never intended to keep, lied, grudgingly made concessions and over time, always clawed them back.
Meanwhile, on the ground during the last century, mobs of white vigilantes used a campaign of terror, intimidating Black potential voters, beating, brutalizing and lynching African Americans, and burning down Black businesses and whole communities.  
Americans love to push out their chests and gloat about the freedoms citizens enjoy, but a dirty little secret is that being “American” has never referred to ALL Americans.
Throughout much of history, African Americans and their native brothers and sisters were forced to stand outside the proverbial shop window looking in, barred from entering by menacing gatekeepers and often forcibly removed, beaten, and killed if they tried to get inside.
The ability to vote is the sacred touchstone of American democracy but to this point, it is merely aspirational, frail, ethereal, because those opposed to electoral freedom have never quite figured out how to contend with America’s Original Sin.
For centuries, those in power found, and continue to manufacture, techniques to wage a relentless, multi-pronged war against a people.
The latest antagonists, in a long list of adversaries, are Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature and the MAGA-Republican-led US Supreme Court.
The future of the Voting Rights Act
Earlier in October, justices listened to arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, a significant redistricting case that could determine the very future of the Voting Rights Act.
Voting Rights Act supporters rally outside Supreme Court as justices hear Louisiana case

If the high court overturns Section 2 – a provision that bans racial discrimination in voting — GOP-controlled legislatures would rush to redraw at least 19 more voting districts for the House of Representatives in favor of Republicans in the 2026 midterms, according to a recent report by the voting rights advocacy groups Black Voters Matter Fund and Fair Fight Action. 
The result, a National Public Radio story notes, could have “a cascading effect on congressional maps in mostly Southern states where Republicans either control both legislative chambers and the governor’s office or have a veto-proof majority in the legislature — and where voting is racially polarized, with Black voters tending to vote Democratic and white voters tending to vote Republican.”
New maps would deny racial minority voters a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidate, with Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas possibly ending up with fewer Democratic representatives in Congress. 
Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee could lose all of theirs, the report finds. And as much as 30% of the Congressional Black Caucus and 11% of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus could also be lost.
It is not out of the realm of possibility that Republicans would cement one-party control of the House for at least a generation, according to Cliff Albright, co-founder and executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund.

“Part of the point that we’re trying to make with this report is that what happens in the South doesn’t just stay in the South,” Albright adds. “This racial gerrymandering has the ability to not just disempower, disenfranchise Black voters and to eliminate Black elected officials and Latino elected officials. What happens in these states impacts the entire country.” 
In Florida DeSantis and his MAGA Republican accomplices have eagerly embraced President Donald Trump’s commands for Republican state leaders to hold special sessions to redraw electoral districts in favor of the GOP.
DeSantis has argued in favor of manipulating electoral mechanisms to ensure that Florida is one of those states.
“I think the state is malapportioned,” he said at a press conference in Bradenton. “So I do think it would be appropriate to do a redistricting in the mid-decade. So we’re working through what that would look like, but I can tell you just look at how the population has shifted in different parts of the state over a four-to-five-year period. It’s been really significant.”

Using population data from the US Census, legislators or independent commissions draw district lines once a decade to account for population changes. But Trump has upended the practice in an effort to pad the slim GOP majority in the House of Representatives.
The governor is proud of his actions in 2022 when he vetoed an original congressional redistricting map passed by the Legislature, labeling it a “disaster.” DeSantis then championed a proposal the Legislature agreed to pass that erased Black representation in Northern Florida and helped to flip Congress. 
While a variety of voting rights groups sued to strike down that map, the Florida Supreme Court ruledthat it was constitutional. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz said that legislators had a “superior” obligation to follow federal equal protection law, and not the Fair Districts Amendment passed by Florida voters in 2010. 
That amendment had a clause modeled after the Voting Rights Act now being scrutinized by the U.S. Supreme Court that said legislators could not diminish the ability of minorities to elect a representative of their choice. The Florida Supreme Court decision gives legislators in the future a way to sidestep that clause.
The Fair District Amendment also bans congressional districts from being “drawn with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or an incumbent.”
But will DeSantis and the Legislature be able to use court rulings related to race to draw districts that accomplish the goal of flipping Democratic seats while at the same time eliminating minority representation in Congress? Time will tell.
Florida Supreme Court upholds congressional district maps

The League of Women Voters of Florida detailed the deliberate and expansive efforts by DeSantis and his cronies to use legislation, policies, programs and subterfuge to steadily reduce the electoral playing field for African Americans.  
“In recent years, the state of Florida has implemented an alarming series of policies that undermine voter participation, creating conditions ripe for mass voter intimidation, LWV officials said in the report. “State officials, led by Governor Ron DeSantis, have weaponized law enforcement to target voters across the state, from the arrest of formerly incarcerated individuals who believed they were eligible to vote to the harassment of citizens who signed petitions for a reproductive right ballot initiative.”
The report described these instances of systematic voter intimidation as a “a dangerous and deliberate attempt to disenfranchise certain communities – led explicitly by state institutions. They undermine both the rule of law and democratic norms. These actions create a chilling effect on political participation, discouraging people within the targeted communities from engaging in civic life. Fear and confusion around voter eligibility causes many to remain de facto disenfranchised even when they are legally eligible to vote.”
For years before the 2024 presidential election, DeSantis and legislative Republicans kept busy carrying out their part of their national party’s agenda to incapacitate parts of the state’s electoral apparatus to dissuade Black and brown voters, young people, seniors, and other Democratic constituencies from voting.
This meant passing a slew of laws that make it considerably harder to vote than was true four years earlier, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Florida is now one of four states that have “used single bills to enact an array of restrictions, imposing limits across the entire voting process,” the center has reported.
The Sunshine State is among 11 Republican-dominated legislatures that have impinged on ways the electorate can register to vote, while also restricting voter registration drives. 
According to the Brennan Center report, DeSantis has given “partisan actors unprecedented authority over elections”; he has also created “election police” to investigate and prosecute supposed fraud and intimidate eligible voters.
We are living in a time when those responsible for upholding the law are doing everything but. DeSantis, Trump, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the Supreme Court and phalanx of MAGA Republicans are making their moves with significant, concerted pushback from Democrats.
There is little expectation that the forces of regression, bigotry and retreat – who have plotted and schemed on ways to eviscerate not just the Voting Rights Act, but also to ensure that Black and brown voting power is permanently hobbled, disabled, demolished, will be slowed down.
And with this, we can expect these rogues to steal not just the 2026 midterm elections but the 2028 presidential elections as well.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)When natural disasters strike in the Lower 48, people affected are compensated for income lost from wage-earning jobs that have been interrupted, as well as lost assets with assigned financial value.
For residents of the Yukon-Kuskokwim region who were displaced by Typhoon Halong, such losses are not so easily quantified.
In the region’s affected villages, which are among the most rural communities in North America, most residents are Yup’ik and adherence to Indigenous traditions is strong. Those traditions are tied to the harvesting of wild foods and materials for personal and family needs. And much of the labor performed to carry out those harvests falls outside of the usual American cash economy.
Losses inflicted by the disaster in Kipnuk, Kwigillingok and other storm-damaged villages include the stockpiles of wild fish, game meat, berries and greens that have been built over months of unpaid work.
While there is not a dollar number for the food that was lost, its value is high, said Kelsey Ciugun Wallace, president of the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.
“Our foods are just so important to who we are as Native people,” said Wallace, who is Yup’ik and from Bethel, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta’s hub community. Traditional foods provide not just nutrition, but also emotional and spiritual support and “connect us to the land and water,” she said.
In response to the loss of subsistence food and access to food-gathering sites, the Alaska Native Heritage Center and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium are funneling traditional foods to displaced families.
They are coordinating a program that is taking in donations from around the state. Through it, frozen foods, like sockeye salmon from the Copper River Basin, muktuk from the North Slope and berries from Southcentral Alaska’s mountain slopes, have been collected in a huge freezer trailer parked at the heritage center,
The volunteer response has been overwhelming, and it extends beyond donations to cooking, preparing and serving, Wallace said.
“All the aunties in Anchorage are wanting to cook,” she said.
For ANTHC, the emergency food collection and distribution adds to a year-round traditional foods program, said Shea Seigert, the consortium’s senior manager of external affairs.
Seigert said he does not know how long the emergency program will run. “As long as there’s a need, we will continue to fill it,” he said.
Some of the donated food is being used by the nonprofit World Central Kitchen, which has been providing hot meals to evacuees and emergency workers at the William A. Egan Civic & Convention Center in downtown Anchorage and the Alaska Airlines Center on the University of Alaska Anchorage campus. Both sites have been operating as assistance hubs for the evacuees in the Anchorage area, and the two sites were also used as temporary shelters, though by this week, most of the clients were set to be transitioned to longer-lasting and more private living quarters, according to state officials.
Government agencies providing economic assistance are also attempting to accommodate the cultural needs of the people displaced by the typhoon.
One is the U.S. Small Business Administration, which typically provides low-interest loans to help victims of declared natural disasters recover from economic losses.
Kelly Loeffler, the SBA’s administrator, said the agency recognizes that damages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region are different from disaster damages in the Lower 48.
Loeffler, at a Wednesday news conference held in Anchorage with Gov. Mike Dunleavy, said the SBA has “modified some of the rules in order to speed relief to those survivors.”
Loans will be available to replace lost or damaged subsistence-related items, Loeffler said at the news conference, which was held outside the Alaska Airlines Center. That includes things like all-terrain vehicles, hunting knives and boats.
“We’re going to continue to respond to unique needs of the terrain, people and this culture and make sure that the funding meets the moment,” she said.
However, damages to subsistence camps are not eligible for such aid, according to an SBA statement issued on Monday.
The quandary of how to compensate for subsistence losses also affected the response to a similar disaster three years ago.  When remnants of Typhoon Merbok struck the same region and wreaked havoc farther north into the Bering Strait region, rural and mostly Indigenous Alaskans had to work through aid systems to get compensation for lost subsistence gear and equipment.
Federal agencies attempted to tailor aid programs to the needs of rural Alaska residents, and some of the relief effort focused on rebuilding and repairing traditional fishing and hunting camps. Additionally, the U.S. Geological Survey stepped up its mapping of the region and its identification of coastal hazards in Merbok’s wake.
But there were bumps, such as improper language translations provided by a contractor the Federal Emergency Management Agency hired.
The urgency for tailoring disaster response to the particular needs of Western Alaska is expected to continue into the future. Scientists project that climate change, by warming the ocean, thawing permafrost and thus causing the land to sink, raising sea levels and diminishing sea ice will trigger yet more regional disasters like Halong and Merbok.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC08537-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 22:56:41.418629

Dr. Jay Butler, who is a nationally recognized expert in infectious diseases, will start his UAA position on Dec. 28, the university announced on Friday.
Butler has experience in state, federal and tribal governments. Most recently, he was deputy director for infectious diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. He held that position for six years. He left there in July, at a time when the CDC was being targeted for mass firings and cutbacks.

	Before then, he served as Alaska’s chief medical officer, chief of the Alaska Division of Health’s epidemiology section and director of the CDC’s Arctic Investigations Program. He also worked as senior director of community health services for the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, among other positions. And he served for 16 years as an affiliate professor at UAA’s WWAMI School of Medical Education, part of an educational partnership between Alaska, Washington, Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. The program enables students in those states to get medical degrees, giving them options for studying at six different universities.
In a statement, UAA Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Denise Runge said Butler’s deep experience will be an asset to the College of Health.
“Dr. Butler joins UAA at an exciting time for our university,” Runge said in the statement. “His leadership and commitment to Alaska will be instrumental in strengthening UAA’s position as the state’s designated health university. We are thrilled to welcome him into a role supported by a strong team of faculty, staff and leaders within the College of Health.”
Butler’s work includes several years of research into influenza and other infectious diseases and their impact on Alaska Native people.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Seafood tissue samples taken from the Tangipahoa River last month contained harmful levels of arsenic in five of the 13 samples tested, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality reported.
It’s the latest update from state officials on the river’s health after the Aug. 22 fire and explosion at the Smitty’s Supply Inc. petroleum products facility in Roseland. The industrial disaster coated nearby homes and businesses with oily soot, while huge tanks filled with automotive oils and fluids spilled into the river and adjacent ponds. Cleanup efforts have collected 11 million gallons of liquid waste, according to state estimates. 
The state made its seafood test findings public late Friday in a news release, explaining Wildlife and Fisheries officials collected samples from fish, shrimp and crabs from the river as well as similar catch from Bayou Lacombe 40 miles away for comparison. 
The samples were taken Sept. 16-23 and submitted to the Louisiana Department of Health for testing. 
“With the exception of arsenic, no contaminants detected in seafood samples from the Tangipahoa River were present at levels expected to pose harm to public health,” the LDEQ statement said.
The agency explained further its analysis did not differentiate between organic and inorganic arsenic, the former being far less toxic. A 2016 study from the National Institutes of Health found human exposure to organic arsenic is most common through eating seafood though it is generally nontoxic.
Inorganic arsenic, when the heavy metal element combines with carbon or other materials, has been linked to different types of cancer and nerve damage. Exposure to this form is most common from drinking water contaminated with industrial products, according to the American Cancer Association. Fertilizers are also a recognized source of inorganic arsenic. 
State officials also pointed out there is already a state health advisory against eating fish from the Tangipahoa River for mercury levels that dates back to 2003. It covers black drum, bowfin, crappie, flathead catfish, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, red ear sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth buffalo and spotted bass.      
Earlier Friday, the Department of Environmental Quality and parish officials reopened a small lower stretch of Tangipahoa River to maritime traffic, though upper portions remain closed as cleanup crews continue to deploy spill containment booms.

Montana’s state Senate President, Matt Regier, has requested the first bill draft of the 2027 Legislature to rein in what he described as “political agendas” at teacher educational conferences. 
The move follows backlash from conservative Republicans after recordings from several sessions of the Montana Federation of Public Employees educator conference were released on social media about culture-war topics, including book bans, gender ideology, and censorship in art. 
The educator conference had more than 300 sessions educators could attend during two days in October and provided required professional development units for educators. 
Shortly after the conference and announcement from Regier, MFPE said it was proud of the presentations on topics in math, science, language, art and more. It said nearly 1,000 educators from public and private schools attended.
With the backing of State Superintendent Susie Hedalen, Regier requested the bill draft title “Revise education laws related to teacher training and education and meetings of teacher organizations,” which he said will be similar to a bill brought this session that failed on a final vote in the Senate during the 2025 session. 
“Coming into this session, we knew this was an issue with PIR (pupil-instruction-related) days. There had been reporting on it from the conference last year,” Regier, the Kalispell Republican, said. “We need to make sure that tax dollars aren’t going towards political agendas in our schools.”
The controversy over the educators conference arose earlier this month after an individual went “undercover” at the conference and recorded educators at several of the sessions, releasing snippets of conversation online and tagging elected officials. 
Amanda Curtis, president of MFPE, told the Daily Montanan that the recordings and subsequent backlash from Regier and Hedalen was disinformation and lacked context. 
“I think I just have to say they are outright lying about what happens at this conference, and I don’t really understand what good it’s serving Montana students,” Curtis said. “There’s a lot of heartburn and disappointment in the Senate president and superintendent grandstanding on the first bill title being a teacher attack bill when they really could be focusing on helping … recruit and retain Montana teachers.”

 Pupil-instruction-related days

Montana’s administrative rules require schools to close for two days every October for professional development pupil-instruction related (PIR) days, where teachers can attend annual meetings of various state associations. 
Teachers are paid for the two days when students are not in class if they attend an approved professional development meeting and earn professional development units, or PDUs, which are required to keep their license. 
The third week of October has been designated as a time for teachers to do their professional development for decades. 
The state’s largest union, MFPE, has put on its teacher education conference for more than 30 years, Curtis said, in cooperation with the Office of Public Instruction. But the educator’s conference is not the only conference that takes place during that week — other professional organizations hold their own conferences at the same time. 
The Montana State Literacy Association Conference, the Association for Career and Technical Education Conference, the Montana Conference of Education Leadership, the Montana Music Educators Association Conference all schedule their programs for the October PIR days. 
The MHSA All-State music festival, for band, choir, and orchestra students, also takes place during the two days off; as does the all-state youth hunt. 
In a joint press release, Hedalen and Regier said their legislation would “end the practice of Montana teachers receiving educational credit for their participation in conferences promoting extreme leftist ideology and classroom indoctrination.”
“Montana has been closing schools and paying teachers for two days every year to attend this conference in order to develop professionally and better serve their students. But instead of learning how to instruct students on core skills and prepare them for life, these conferences have been indoctrinating teachers with leftist political extremism,” Regier said in the release.
Curtis said that broad legislation that could remove PIR days from state law would have wide-reaching implications for educators and students, and said that MFPE was proud to stand behind the extensive curriculum offered at their seminar. 
“There’s a lot of righteous indignation from members who are teachers who have been attending this conference for all or part of the 30 years,” Curtis said. “There’s a new fervor to join MFPE, I think from folks who have maybe not been as excited about union membership and can clearly see through the crazy culture war attacks.”
 Undercover recordings 

The MFPE conference, held in Missoula, included more than 320 different sessions for educators to attend, mostly one- or two-hours modules capped at 20 to 30 educators. 
The sessions covered the full spectrum of opportunities for educators, including topics like “Dyslexia the Superpower;” “Bring the stock market to life in your classroom;” “Advancing proficiency in STEM: practical strategies with AI and socratic dialogue;” “Fostering curiosity in your classroom with live butterflies;” “Rockets in the science classroom, Grades 6 7 8 9;” and a panel on school funding sponsored by the Legislature’s Interim School Funding Committee. OPI also had exhibition booths and their own presentations.
But Hedalen and Regier’s legislation focused on four seminars “promoting radical gender ideology, DEI, nude child photography, and sexually explicit books.”
Finley Warden, who isn’t a teacher but on social media says he goes “undercover to expose the far left,” recorded parts of four seminars and released short pieces of audio. Warden is a young, Missoula-based conservative activist who has testified before the Legislature 
According to an MFPE spokesperson, Warden registered for the conference as himself. In various sessions he presented himself as an art education student and a math teacher, and was introduced as himself by Curtis in one session.
Curtis said the recordings lacked any context, couldn’t be verified, and might be illegal under Montana law, which requires all-party consent before making audio recordings in private spaces. She said the union is consulting with attorneys and would take steps to protect the personal and professional safety of anyone recorded without their consent. 
One seminar was “DEI &A in the 2025 Art Room,” which included a discussion about censorship of art, specifically the 2024 removal of photographer Sally Mann’s exhibition from a gallery in Texas by police. Mann, once named the country’s best photographer, has sparked controversy going back to the 1990s, over a series of her work depicting her young children, sometimes in the nude. The National Coalition Against Censorship in a statement about the controversy said the photos contain “neither sexual context nor sexual content.”
The recording of the teachers’ discussion includes references to how the Nazi regime censored abstract art, and how to have discussions with students over whether censorship in art is acceptable. 
Other seminars that drew ire included one, capped at 25 educators, that was a training on advocacy and law for librarians. The course description stated it would show ways librarians can “uphold the laws protecting libraries in the face of information and material challenges and the challenge to our profession as a whole.”
A portion of that seminar, released in a recording, centered around a librarian telling a “victory story” about a graphic novel that had been removed from a school library, and the librarian’s role in getting it put back on the shelf after numerous students had requested it. 
Regier and Hedalen described the situation as a story about “bringing a sexually explicit book back to her library to provide to middle school students.” 
The book in question, a graphic novel in the Heartstopper series, focuses on a fictional gay high school couple, and has been the focus of several book bans in other states. 
The press release from the state describes the book as including “multiple passages of explicit softcore pornography.” The nonprofit Common Sense Media, which allows parents to rate media content, lists it as appropriate for ages 14 and up, and says it includes passages of high school students in a sex education class, and “implied sexual activity.”
A third seminar that was recorded included a member of the National Education Association sharing that there are educational modules that educators can access online to learn about LGBTQ+ issues, including gender identity and gender expression. 
None of the MFPE sessions are mandatory for educators. 
Curtis told the Daily Montanan that lacking context and the extent of discussions which took place in each seminar, the recordings and their characterization amounted to “lying and misinformation” about the conference.
Regier told the Daily Montanan in a phone call Friday that he was “not demonizing the education system,” but wanted to make sure there were safeguards in place to protect Montana students. 
“If the unions are going to keep going with sexualized content for kids or DEI or any of this other stuff that’s being reported, at a minimum I want to stop taxpayer dollars from going towards these,” Regier said. “If we’ve got 300 great courses here, and one that will sexualize your kids, or if there’s one teacher that has one left-liberal agenda – and they’re there for that and not to teach the kids math — that’s a problem.”
He said the goal of his bill is to put the decision about teacher educational opportunities in the hands of school districts, which can decide whether to keep the October days and what conference teachers should go to, and keep the “bad apples from pushing their agenda.”
He added that the bill will be modeled on House Bill 557, legislation with similar content brought by Rep. Jodee Etchart, R-Billings. The bill passed the House but died in a final vote in the Senate, after two Republican senators changed their votes. 
Regier called out the two senators, who were members of the Nine Republicans who opposed Regier’s leadership during the session and worked with Democrats in the chamber to push through major pieces of legislation, including Medicaid expansion and the state budget. 
“I hope this bill highlights the frustrations of myself and the other legislators who knew about this last session,” Regier said. “The public should know that if they’re voting for parental rights and local control, we want to assure voters there are a lot of good Republicans who have insight who are pushing back.”

 OPI takes a stance 

Following the release of the audio from the teacher’s conference, Hedalen sent a letter to school districts, saying there had been “potential violations of state and federal law in public schools related to DEI and gender identity instruction.” 
The letter reminded educators “to remain in full compliance with the law and to uphold the responsibilities entrusted to us by Montana families,” and pointed to legislation from the 2025 session including House Bill 471, which requires parents opt-in to human sexuality and identity instruction. 
In the press release, Hedalen said she is “currently investigating MFPE and other professional development providers,” to make sure they are following state and federal laws. The release also said that MFPE had not publicly published its conference agenda and list of sessions.
But Curtis said that OPI had been invited to participate “in every step of the planning process” of the conference, as they are every year. 
“Our office took their unanswered emails and lack of attendance in any planning meeting to mean they had no concerns with the conference,” Curtis said. “The list of courses has been available for review since May of 2025. OPI could have just walked over one block to our office, picked up a phone, or sent an email asking us to send a list of courses before they were ever approved.”
In an email, the spokesperson from OPI said that while many sessions at the conference “could have been beneficial to educators, there were also many that were problematic; introducing instruction that would be in violation of state or federal law or the educator code of ethics.”
Asked about specific seminars, OPI commented on the librarian discussing bringing the graphic novel back to the library but said there has been no legal investigation into whether any rules or district or state policies had been violated.  
“The discussion about returning a sexually explicit book to school libraries is ultimately a decision that should rest with parents. They are best positioned to determine whether material of that nature is appropriate for their 12- or 13-year-old children to read,” OPI said. 
Hedalen said through an OPI spokesperson that they had no prior knowledge that anyone was going to make recordings of the MFPE conference and that no one “recommended, suggested, or promoted such actions.”
The spokesperson for OPI clarified that the office does not want to stop PIR days or limit professional development opportunities for educators. 
“Our goal is to end the outdated practice of requiring schools to close for a specific conference and instead empower local districts and teachers to decide how and when to use those days for professional growth,” the spokesperson said in an email. “There are many excellent professional development opportunities available beyond the MFPE conference, including the OPI Summer Institute, the Teacher Learning Hub, and locally-driven PD.”
On Thursday morning, Hedalen had a meeting with Curtis that Hedalen described as “cordial,” but did not offer details. Curtis said it was a “productive meeting” in a press release, and emphasized the organization has a “shared commitment to continue working with her to provide irreplaceable professional development for educators.”
In addition to the requested legislation lawmakers will consider in 2027, the Office of Public Instruction is working on their own changes to professional development for educators. 
“We are currently undertaking a major overhaul of all PDU providers, including removing those that have failed to comply with the MCA or have not provided the necessary information that is required by ARM,” an OPI spokesperson said. “This new system will allow us to offer high-quality professional development courses for our teachers, ensuring they receive the training they need to best support student learning.”

The Boise-based group Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho, which was created this year, announced Oct. 29 it is beginning to collect signatures attempting to qualify the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act to go before voters in the 2026 general election. 
The group filed an initiative petition with the state Aug. 29 and received ballot titles from the Idaho Attorney General’s Office on Oct. 20. 
Under Idaho state law, cannabis means marijuana, and the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. 
The Idaho Medical Cannabis Act seeks to:

Allow qualifying patients with chronic pain or debilitating conditions like cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Crohn’s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder or Alzheimer’s to access regulated cannabis for treatment. In order to access medical cannabis, Idahoans would need to apply for a medical cannabis card by presenting medical records showing a diagnosis of a substantial health condition from a medical professional authorized to make such a diagnosis.  
Establish a regulated licensing system for Idaho-based producers and dispensaries.
Prohibit the public use of medical cannabis, prohibit the sharing of medical cannabis with others and prohibit impaired driving while under the influence of medical cannabis.
Reclassify cannabis from a Schedule 1 drug to Schedule 2 drug in state law in order to allow for research of medical cannabis.  

“This is about giving families and individuals options when nothing else has worked,” said Amanda Watson, communications lead for the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho. “This initiative was created with Idaho values in mind. It would require strong oversight, measures to prevent recreational use and most importantly, it would provide relief for thousands of Idahoans suffering from serious medical conditions. It’s a compassionate, conservative approach to health care.”
The short ballot title for the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act reads: “Measure decriminalizing the use, possession, production, cultivation, transportation, distribution and sale of marijuana by medical cannabis cardholders and production licensees.”
 Idaho Legislature strongly opposes marijuana

The new medical cannabis initiative sets up the potential to have two, dueling cannabis questions on Idaho voters’ ballots in November 2026. 
The Idaho Legislature, which staunchly opposes marijuana, has already placed a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution called House Joint Resolution 4 on the November 2026 ballot in Idaho. If approved by voters, HJR 4 would make it so that only the Idaho Legislature – not Idaho voters – has the power to legalize marijuana or other narcotics. HJR 4 applies to the growing, possession, use, selling, delivering, dispensing, prescribing, manufacturing or transporting of marijuana or other narcotics.  
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs $300 mandatory minimum fine for marijuana possession into law

“Too many legislatures across this nation have sat back and just waited as initiative after initiative would come after them, until they finally overwhelm it and overwhelm the legislature,” state Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, said in March. “We are acting because that’s our responsibility.”
Days before adopting the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution, the Idaho Legislature also passed another law creating a new mandatory minimum fine of $300 for anyone convicted of simple possession of marijuana. 
 What is a ballot initiative and how does it work in Idaho?

In Idaho, a ballot initiative is a form of direct democracy where the voters of Idaho – not the Idaho Legislature – decide whether to pass a new law. 
To qualify the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act for the November 2026 election, supporters need to gather and verify signatures from at least 70,000 registered Idaho voters, with at least 6% of the registered voters in at least 18 of Idaho’s 35 legislative districts.  
Supporters have until April 30 to collect the required signatures and submit them for verification, Watson said. 
If the ballot initiative qualifies for the November 2026 election, it would require a simple majority of voters to approve it. 
All of Idaho’s neighboring states, other than Wyoming, either offer medical cannabis like Utah or recreational marijuana, like Washington, Oregon, Montana and Nevada. 
Since 2012, different groups in Idaho have tried and failed every two years to qualify a medical marijuana ballot initiative to go on the ballot, state records show. 
The Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho is a new, different group that launched this year. In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun, Watson said the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho will use paid signature-gatherers to collect the necessary signatures by the April 30 deadline. Signature gatherers will be paid up to $5 per valid signature, and organizers are focusing on recruiting signature gatherers at this time. Information about applying to be a signature-gatherer is available on the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho’s website 
 What is the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho?

Public records show that experienced, high-profile legal and communications professionals in Boise have been steering the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act to this point.
Watson, president and founder of Boise-based Atlas Strategic Communications, is serving as the communications lead for the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho.
Jeremy Chou, a partner with the Boise law firm/public affairs firm Givens Pursley, represents the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho and submitted official paperwork for the Idaho Medical Cannabis Act to the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office.
Records available through the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office indicate the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho is a Boise-based limited liability company that was created Aug. 1. 
Givens Pursley Corporate Services, which has the same mailing address and a nearly identical name to Chou’s law firm, Givens Pursley LLP, is listed as the registered agent for the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho.
In addition to the limited liability company, a political action committee, or PAC, has also been recently established in Idaho. 
Campaign finance records available through the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office indicate that the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho PAC was created Oct. 23. Those records list Rob Cronin as the treasurer and chairperson of the Natural Medicine Alliance of Idaho PAC, while the mailing address provided is the same address as Watson’s firm, Atlas Strategic Communications. 
The PAC, which is only a few days old, has not reported raising or spending any money as of this article’s publication deadline.

The leak is coming from a well located about 3 miles southeast of Golden Meadow, on the eastern end of Bayou Lafourche. The well is owned by Castex Energy, a Houston company, according to state Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Golden Meadow.
U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Jaiden Hartley said his agency was notified of the incident around 7 a.m. Friday. Coast Guard crews responded to an area just east of Tidewater Dock and found a blown methane well head, he said.
Natural gas condensate was released, and a light sheening was observed on the bayou’s surface, Hartley said. 
It’s unclear when the leak began and how much gas has been released. Technicians were still on scene as of about 5:30 p.m. still working to plug the well head, while cleanup crews were deploying absorbent boom in the area, Hartley said.
Lafourche Parish Fire District 3 Chief Devin Dedon said his department has been on standby in case more personnel are needed to assist. 
“Right now, it seems like Coast Guard has it well under control,” Dedon said. “They got a cleanup crew on scene and will notify us if we’re needed.”",,,,2025-10-31 19:02:19.901360

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Not far from the security line at the Salt Lake City International Airport, a woman struggled, screaming for help as two plain-clothed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers dragged her out. 
A video posted on social media shows one of the agents showing a badge to a Salt Lake City Police officer who observed the scene without interfering at about 4 p.m. on Wednesday. Not many details of the arrest were clear in the following hours, until Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall released a statement Thursday condemning it. 
“I am left wondering and aching from the fear and pain these types of operations keep striking in my heart and the hearts of so many of us,” Mendenhall said.

After watching footage from witnesses, the Salt Lake City Police officer’s body camera and airport surveillance — in which the woman is seen trying to break away from the officers, yelling “I have my papers” — Mendenhall said she had been made aware of the case, involving “multiple plain-clothed ICE agents.”
ICE initially denied being involved in the arrest on Thursday morning, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. But, after the Salt Lake City Police and the airport confirmed the arresting officers were from ICE, the agency released another statement acknowledging their involvement.
Officials with ICE confirmed the woman is a 39 year-old immigrant without permanent legal status in the country from El Salvador who had entered the U.S. in 2007 and had received a removal order in absentia in February 2020.
In a statement, ICE confirmed that the arrest was a targeted enforcement operation and that the woman will be held in their custody pending her removal to El Salvador.
“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is executing its mission of identifying and removing criminal aliens and others who have violated our nation’s immigration laws,” the agency wrote. “All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality.”
A Utah court records search Friday showed only a winter parking infraction in 2022 under the woman’s name.
Mendenhall lamented the incident, saying that so much about ICE operations like the arrest in Salt Lake City remain unknown.



Let us know what you think...


 


“In this case, for example, why were the agents in plain clothes without visible identification? Why did they choose the lobby of the airport—the gateway to our state—where some 28,000 people enter every day?,” Mendenhall said. “What I do know is that nothing about this incident, like so many ICE operations, makes me feel safer as an American.”
The city reached out to federal agencies searching for answers, “in the interest of promoting transparency, accountability and the well-being of all who live in and visit our city,” the Salt Lake City Council said in a statement.
“Incidents like this create fear and uncertainty in our community. The operation was not coordinated with or directed by Salt Lake City Police,” council members said.
City clarifications
While Mendenhall said there are details the city still doesn’t know about the detainment, she said some factors needed to be clarified.
Despite being inside the airport, the pre-security area where the arrest took place is considered a public space. 
Also, the Salt Lake City Police officer who observed the arrest was responding to the commotion in the terminal and visually confirmed the agents’ federal identification, Mendenhall said. 
Local law enforcement is prohibited from interfering with federal immigration enforcement.
In other daily operations from the city police, immigration status doesn’t influence how officers handle the situation, the mayor said, “nor do officers screen for immigration status when placing a person under arrest.”

Shapiro declares disaster emergency over SNAP benefits suspension,Peter Hall,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/food-insecurity/gov-shapiro-declares-disaster-emergency-over-snap-benefits-suspension/,The state will make $5 million available for food banks to weather expected spike in people seeking assistance,"Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding speaks at a news conference Friday at the Philabundance food bank warehouse in south Philadelphia, where Gov. Josh Shapiro announced $5 million in emergency funding to aid food charities as federal SNAP recipients miss their November assistance payments. (Photo by Commonwealth Media Services)As two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to release food assistance money, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Friday the state will make $5 million available to a network of food banks across the commonwealth.
Shapiro also signed a disaster declaration to ensure the state money is available immediately, as 2 million Pennsylvanians who rely on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) miss their November allocations. They would normally be paid Saturday.
“They made this determination even though they are sitting on billions of dollars of congressionally appropriated contingency funds,” Shapiro said in a news conference at the Philabundance food bank warehouse in south Philadelphia.
SNAP provides $366 million a month in food assistance, which benefits about one out of every eight Pennsylvanians – or about 15% of the state’s population.
Lori Jones-Brown, CEO of Philabundance, which is the largest non-profit food bank in the greater Philadelphia area, said food pantries across the region are already using reserves to meet increased demand. 
“Just today, one of my colleagues told me that a mother came to our warehouse North Philly with four kids in our car asking for help,” Jones-Brown said. “Pantries are seeing scared faces and longer lines, and this is happening at a time when we were already seeing record numbers.”

The $5 million in state funding will flow through Feeding Pennsylvania, a statewide association of the commonwealth’s nine food banks that serve more than 1.5 million people annually across all 67 counties.
Additionally, Shapiro said he has launched a private-sector fundraising effort to aid food banks through the SNAP Emergency Relief Fund that has already collected more than $1 million from Pennsylvania business leaders.
Shapiro noted the commonwealth  is part of the coalition of 24 Democratic states that sued the Trump administration this week, seeking a court order directing the U.S. Department of Agriculture to continue food assistance for 42 million people nationwide.
While the ruling is an important win, Shapiro said, the commonwealth still faces a potential crisis in feeding its most vulnerable people. It will take up to 10 days for the administration to get the money into SNAP recipients accounts, he said, and that’s if President Donald Trump obeys the dual court orders.

“Given this administration and its propensity to ignore the rule of law, I don’t trust that they’re going to follow this judge’s ruling,” Shapiro said.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration also canceled $13 million in USDA funding over three years to purchase locally grown food for food banks in the commonwealth. The state is also suing to enforce its contract with the USDA.
“Not only is President Trump harming people who are hungry, he is harming Pennsylvania farmers, and that’s on top of what he’s already done to them with his ill advised tariffs,” Shapiro said. “I think right now, we should be doing everything we can to feed Pennsylvanians and not making excuses as to why it can’t happen.”
State House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) said Shapiro’s actions show leadership and a responsible solution to the crisis, which she attributed to Republicans in Congress.
“While this solution is temporary, we can do more to ensure fewer Pennsylvanians rely on programs like SNAP, by increasing the minimum wage and investing in our schools and job training programs to give every person a path to success,” McClinton said in a statement Friday.
Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny) and Health and Human Services Committee Chairperson Art Haywood (D-Montgomery) said in a statement the loss of SNAP payments will place an extraordinary strain on food charities.
“My colleagues and I have been receiving a deluge of calls from concerned constituents, fearful that they will not be able to stock their pantries and refrigerators because of the heartless decision of the president and his enablers in the federal government,” Costa said.

SNAP, historically known as food stamps, allows low income families and individuals to purchase food from neighborhood markets. For many, SNAP benefits have been sufficient to put food on the table, said Julie Bancroft, CEO of Feeding Pennsylvania. That organization will distribute the $5 million in emergency state funding to its network of food banks around the state.
“Where will they turn? They’ll turn to food banks and pantries, many for the first time, because their SNAP benefits have been just enough to make ends meet,” Bancroft said, noting the sudden increase in people seeking food assistance is exacerbated by the federal government shutdown during which most federal workers are not being paid.
“Our network is using cash reserves to keep shelves stocked, but these resources are limited and will run out, making emergency funding critical. The funding announced today will help ease the pressure in a time of crisis,” Bancroft said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/28564_gov_SNAP_DZ_009-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 19:02:19.901360

Dianne Primavera, left, and Budget Director Mark Ferrandino, right, at the Governor's Residence in Denver on Friday. (Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Friday presented his initial budget plans for the next fiscal year, including recommendations to curb growth in state Medicaid spending.
The budget proposal includes about $18.6 billion in general fund spending, up 2.3% from the current fiscal year, which began in July. The Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee is in charge of crafting the budget and lawmakers are in charge of passing it, but the governor’s office gives hefty input through this proposal and an updated one in January.
The proposal calls for a 13% general fund reserve, down from the typical 15% reserve in recent years.
“This budget is a reflection of our priorities and supports our students by fully funding our schools, improving public safety, and addressing the strained fiscal environment we’re in due to H.R. 1 and President (Donald) Trump’s reckless tariffs,” Polis said in a statement.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
H.R. 1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is the federal tax and spending measure Trump signed in July.
Medicaid growth has vastly outpaced how much the state government is allowed to spend under the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, a state constitutional amendment that pegs spending increases to population growth and inflation. The ballooning program was one reason lawmakers needed to trim $1.2 billion from the budget this year, and it is contributing to the expected $850 million gap next year.
Medicaid is a health insurance program operated jointly by federal and state governments that provides coverage to low-income families and individuals. Almost one-fifth of Coloradans receive Medicaid benefits.
Polis proposes an increase in Medicaid spending by about $300 million, versus the projected growth of about $630 million. He called that a “down payment” to get program spending closer to the TABOR cap rate — spending has increased about 8.8% per year over the last decade, according to his office, about double the TABOR cap growth. If that trend continues, Medicaid spending could eat up most of the state’s general fund spending ability.
“There’s two levers on Medicaid,” Polis said during the presentation at the Governor’s Residence in Denver. “One is how many people you cover and two is what you cover. There have been a number of benefits that have been added in recent years and some of those aren’t sustainable over time.”
He highlighted dental benefits. They were once capped at $1,500 per year, but then that cap was lifted. Polis wants to reinstate a cap at $3,000 annually.
He also wants legislation next year to set a year-over-year growth rate in Medicaid general fund spending. His office is working with a third party to compare Colorado’s Medicaid program with national benchmarks to give some idea of how to curb growth. A public report on those findings should be available late this year or early January.
Administrative cost cuts
The budget proposal also includes suggestions for changes in departmental administration costs, ranging from a 34% reduction in the governor’s office to an 8% increase in the Department of Public Safety. The Department of Early Childhood would see an 11% decrease, the Department of Local Affairs would have a 26% decrease and the Department of Higher Education would have a 16% decrease in operating costs. Overall, those cuts would save about $25 million.
“It doesn’t mean anyone is laid off,” he said. “It means openings wouldn’t be filled.”
Polis is once again calling for the privatization of Pinnacol Assurance, the the insurer of “last resort” for workers’ compensation, in order to cover the continuation of the senior homestead exemption and state building maintenance. His proposal predicts a $400 million profit from such a sale.
On education, Polis wants to limit in-state tuition increases to 2.6%. He also wants to raise per-pupil funding in K-12 to $413 and partially start to implement a new school finance formula intended to send money to districts based on individual student needs, instead of the five-year average number of students.

(Getty Images)Most individual health insurance plans sold in Missouri will increase in price next year even as customers prepare to dig deeper into their own funds to replace costs previously covered by federal tax credits.
The state Department of Commerce and Insurance on Friday released the approved rates for individual plans, most of which are sold on the health insurance marketplace. One carrier, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City, is lowering premiums an average of 4.1% for its plans available in 30 western Missouri counties. Some plans offered by the company will see an increase of as much as 9%.
Premiums will increase for the other eight carriers offering plans in all or part of the state. Ambetter Health plans, available off the marketplace in 109 counties, will increase an average of 1.9%, while Cox Health Plans, available in five southwest Missouri counties, will go up an average of 30.4%.
The costs for some Missourians will increase 70% or more if Congress does not extend tax credits enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because congressional Democrats refuse to vote to fund the government until Republicans add an extension of the credits to the spending bill. Republicans argue the government should be reopened before negotiations over subsidies resume.
Premiums will increase for the other eight carriers offering plans in all or part of the state. Ambetter Health plans, available off the marketplace in 109 counties, will increase an average of 1.9%, while Cox Health Plans, available in five southwest Missouri counties, will go up an average of 30.4%.
There are at least two companies offering health plans in every county, with a handful in the St. Louis area seeing seven vying for their business. 
“First and foremost, Missourians need to know our state continues to have a competitive market, which means they will continue to have meaningful choices when it comes to their health coverage,” Angela Nelson, department director, said in a news release. 
In addition to reporting the average change, the department also provided the largest change in cost for any single plan offered by the nine carriers. Those increases ranged from 6.4% for an Ambetter Health plan, to 110% for a Medica plan offered in 54 counties. 
Open enrollment for the individual health plans begins Saturday. Consumers who purchase coverage by Dec. 15 will have it start Jan. 1. Plans may be purchased until Jan. 15, but coverage will not begin until Feb. 1, the release stated.
Missourians will start considering their choices without knowing whether enhanced subsidies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency will be extended.
The original Affordable Care Act subsidies that took effect in 2014 tied the actual cost to consumers to a percentage of their income for people earning less than four times the federal poverty level. Consumers with poverty level income — $15,650 for 2025 for individuals, $32,150 for a family of four — paid 2.1% of their income as premiums, sliding up to 10% for households with income between three and four times the poverty level.
The enhanced tax credits put a cap on out-of-pocket premium costs for all consumers, with the highest earners paying 8.5% of their income and those with incomes below 150% of poverty level paying no premiums for their insurance.
“There is still a tremendous amount of uncertainty about whether Congress will extend the premium tax subsidies into 2026, and we are keeping a close eye on any developments at the federal level,” Nelson said.
Only two of the eight companies offering individual plans in Missouri through the federal marketplace will have plans available in every county or almost every county in the state. United Healthcare plans are available in every county and Ambetter from Home State Health plans can be purchased in every county except Clark, Lewis, Marion, St. Francois, Schuyler and Scotland.
The average monthly premium is about $755 for both the United Healthcare and Ambetter offerings, an increase of about 15% and 25%, respectively. 
An individual with an income of $62,600 a year or more would have to pay the full premium if the enhanced credits are not extended. That means paying $9,060 over a year for the average Ambetter or United Healthcare plan instead of $5,321, an increase of 70%.

 Cost increase impacts

A panel of community members and experts hosted by the Community Health Commission of Missouri in St. Louis on Thursday underlined potential impacts of the expiring subsidies.
Sheldon Weisgrau, vice president for health and policy advocacy at the Missouri Foundation for Health, said higher premiums could lead younger, healthier people to forgo insurance, driving up prices for those who continue to purchase plans.
“When folks can’t afford to buy insurance, it doesn’t mean they won’t get sick,” Weisgrau said. When they do enter the health system, providers pick up the cost, “and again, that eventually gets passed on to everybody else.” 
As Missourians confront higher insurance premiums, 650,000 low-income residents of the state could also be forced to cope with a loss of federal food benefits, with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, set to run out of funding on Nov. 1. Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use contingency funds to pay at least partial benefits, but SNAP recipients could still face delays.
Panelists on Thursday said instability across federal safety net programs means communities will have to fill in the gaps through mutual aid.
“I think the neighborhood, the village, needs to be recreated,” said Shanelle Woods, one of the community members.
“There’s someone probably on your block that has extra,” Woods said. “Maybe Miss Jones has a pot of soup and she’s willing to share with your children. But, you have to build a relationship with your neighbor first.”
Panelists said policy conversations don’t address the difficulty of accessing safety net programs even when they are not being cut or suspended.
Shellie Robinson, who went on medical leave after being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, said she struggled so long to prove she was eligible to receive disability benefits that she eventually had to go back to work.
Her doctors vouched for her, but, Robinson said, “it still wasn’t enough.”
“Who has the time to wait online or wait on a call for nearly three hours to talk to someone, to get it?” Robinson asked.
Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said that despite a “myth” that people who buy marketplace insurance plans are “undeserving, or they’re lazy,” many working people don’t have access to affordable insurance. Older adults who don’t qualify for Medicare – for instance, due to a chronic condition – may also need marketplace plans.
“There are flaws in our insurance markets that put people in this situation,” McBride said. “That’s the truth of the matter, and you don’t hear that from Washington. It’s a blame game.”

Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency Friday and directed $5 million from the state’s budget reserve trust fund to food banks that are part of the Feeding Kentucky network.
This came on the same day a federal judge ruled that  the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to halt funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the government shutdown is illegal. The Massachusetts judge gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond. SNAP benefits are set to run out Saturday. 
Kentucky to hold a state food drive as threat to food assistance looms, governor says

Beshear’s order is “to ensure Kentuckians have access to food over the next few days,” his office said. About 563,080 people in Kentucky rely on SNAP to afford groceries.
Beshear’s executive order instructs the Kentucky Division of Emergency Management to work with the Office of the State Budget Director to “identify, allocate, and transfer funds as necessary from available sources to support the food banks during the lapse of SNAP funding,” beginning with the $5 million. The Cabinet for Health and Family Services will then provide the identified funds to Feeding Kentucky.
The budget reserve trust fund, also known as the “rainy day” fund, contains $3.7 billion. SNAP benefits in Kentucky total about $110 million a month.
Feeding Kentucky has seven food banks around the commonwealth. They will use the funds to buy and distribute extra food during the state of emergency, according to the executive order. 
The Lantern has asked Feeding Kentucky for comment. 
A federal judge in Rhode Island also ordered the Trump administration to fund SNAP. But even with the court orders, there could be delays in benefits. The USDA has not said how it will respond to the judges’ orders.

(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, recalled a Native mother in her 30s who started having memory loss and other dementia-like symptoms.
The woman had suffered multiple blows to her head and falls at the hands of her husband over the years. He had wanted to disable her, to make it more difficult for her to keep her children if she tried to leave him, Echo-Hawk said.
Many Native women have traumatic brain injury symptoms as a direct result of abuse, Echo-Hawk said. Tribal health advocates and groups serving survivors have long been aware of the problem, she said, but there has been little national research documenting the extent of it.
“It’s a very difficult thing to see,” said Echo-Hawk, of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma. “This is a pressing concern.”
The Urban Indian Health Institute, an Indigenous health research group, this month launched a first-of-its-kind national survey of American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian women to determine the prevalence of brain injuries in Native survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence. The goal is to illuminate the extent of the problem, guide clinicians, raise public awareness and direct resources.
A 2015 study in Arizona found a higher incidence of traumatic brain injuries in Native women in that state, but the new survey is the first national, Indigenous-led study of its kind, according to the institute.
It comes as domestic violence groups across the nation are struggling with federal funding delays caused by the government shutdown. As the impasse continues, the Trump administration has furloughed grant workers at the Office on Violence Against Women, which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice.

Traumatic brain injuries can cause memory loss, confusion and long-term behavioral changes and raise the risk of dementia. Some abusers intentionally inflict traumatic brain injuries on their victims because it doesn’t leave visible bruises, according to the Brain Injury Association of America.
The link between domestic violence and traumatic brain injuries has been well-documented in women generally, and the effects of such injuries have been studied in former football players and veterans. But research on Native communities is lacking. Even when Native victims show up in ERs, their cases often go underreported.
In a previous survey of survivors, some Native women reported broken teeth, evidence of blows to the head, Echo-Hawk said. But pushing and strangulation also can cause traumatic brain injuries.
Lackluster investigations may perpetuate high Native infant mortality rate

Violence is a public health crisis among American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian women, who are overrepresented in intimate partner violence statistics. Fifty-five percent report experiencing intimate partner violence, and a disproportionate number of Native women and girls are murdered or go missing.
In a 2020 survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 44% of American Indian and Alaska Native women reported being raped in their lifetime.
“People are losing their children because of memory loss and dementia,” Echo-Hawk said. “When people are experiencing intimate partner violence, they end up in ERs. Their children suffer. The whole community suffers as a direct result. And the same with the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.”
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

Doctors other hospital staff should receive more training on brain injuries and should know which communities are most likely to experience violence, said Nikki Cristobal, policy and research specialist for Pouhana ʻO Nā Wāhine, a nonprofit domestic violence resource center for Native Hawaiians.
Cristobal said one survivor told her clinicians hadn’t performed a brain scan or traumatic brain injury assessment on her, despite her ongoing psychological and cognitive symptoms. “It never occurred to anybody,” she said.
“We have to talk more about it,” said Cristobal, who worked with Echo-Hawk on developing the survey and is the principal investigator for the Missing and Murdered Native Hawaiian Women, Girls and Mahu state task force.
Native communities, including Native Hawaiians, have endured long-term, intergenerational traumas during colonization and forced assimilation that can’t be ignored when targeting the disproportionate rates of violence, Cristobal said.
“It’s the undercurrent,” Cristobal said. “It’s the precursor.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-31 22:17:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,"JXN Water to move forward with rate increase, report says",Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/31/jxn-water-to-move-forward-with-rate-increase-report-says/,The water rate increase Ted Henifin requested  this spring for Jackson customers may go forward..,"JXN Water, the third-party manager of Jackson’s water and wastewater systems, said in a quarterly report filed Friday that it will move forward with a rate increase on water bills it first requested this spring. The increase will go into effect by Dec. 15, the report said. 
The rate increase, on average, would raise Jacksonians’ monthly bills — which also include costs for sewer and sanitation — by 12%, the utility said. 
Ted Henifin, who heads the utility, has reiterated JXN Water is rapidly losing money because of inadequate revenue. In September, the utility said it was “currently insolvent.” 
Henifin could not be reached Friday to confirm the utility’s plans to raise rates. JXN Water communications officer Aisha Carson said the report does not serve as an official notice of a rate increase. The quarterly update said JXN Water will issue an official notice to customers by Nov. 15.
Both Jackson’s mayor and city council have spoken out against the proposal, arguing it’s unfair to ask more from those who are contributing while about 30% of customers aren’t paying their bills. The city council voted in April against the increase, and Mayor John Horhn reaffirmed his position last week during a meeting with state lawmakers.
But under a federal court’s stipulated order that outlines the scope of Henifin’s powers and responsibilities, the court allows the utility to proceed with a rate increase without the city’s approval and as long as more than a year has passed since the last rate hike. JXN Water first increased rates in February 2024.
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate, who appointed Henifin to his role in 2022, said during hearings this summer the utility should explore all other avenues for funding, including collections from apartment complexes with large debts, before raising rates. Over the last year, JXN Water has pressured apartment complexes to pay their debts leading to shutoffs and ongoing lawsuits. It’s been months, though, since Wingate has last discussed the proposal, and it’s unclear if he plans to address the matter anytime soon.
Henifin’s frustration with the judge’s stance came out during a July hearing where the utility manager threatened to quit, although he walked back the statement soon after. 
In response to Wingate and city officials, Henifin maintained that even if all customers paid their bill at the current rates, JXN Water would still lose money. The utility estimated in September that it was losing $3 million a month.
The quarterly update also addressed $54 million the utility asked Congress to reallocate for operating funds. The money was originally part of $450 million in federal funding set aside for larger projects. 
While the money was held up as part of the ongoing federal government shutdown, JXN Water said it expected Congress to pass the funding bill “in the coming days,” and that the Environmental Protection Agency would issue the money to the utility in a new grant. But, the report added, the utility wouldn’t be able to access the $54 million until early 2026.

Ron DeSantis to step in to provide food aid being lost due to the government shutdown, hailed a pair of  federal court rulings late Friday that may allow the aid to flow again. 
But, they also warned it wasn’t enough to ensure food security for the nearly 3 million state residents who rely on the program.
A federal judge in Boston ruled Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to pause a food assistance program for nearly 42 million people was illegal — but gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her finding before she decides on a motion to force the benefits be paid despite the ongoing government shutdown.
At nearly the same time Friday, a Rhode Island federal judge in a similar case brought by cities and nonprofit groups ordered the United States Department of Agriculture to continue payments and granted a request for a temporary restraining order.
Speaking on a Zoom conference call organized by the group Sabotaging Our Safety, state Sen. Shevrin Jones, D-Miami Gardens, said he was grateful for the judicial intervention but he cautioned that it was “only a temporary fix.”

 “We’re talking about a fund that could run dry in what, less than a month? Then that’s not stability, that’s survival,” he said. 
The USDA last week posted a notice saying SNAP benefits would expire Nov. 1 and put the blame on Democrats for not agreeing to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded. 
Democrats are against passing a funding plan that doesn’t extend the enhanced premium tax credits that lower the costs of so-called Obamacare plans purchased through the federal health exchange (healthcare.gov).
The partisan impasse has resulted in a month-long government shutdown.
“The best way for SNAP to continue is for the shutdown to end. If not for Congressional Democrats blocking government funding, November SNAP benefits would be paid on-time,” the USDA notice, first reported by Axios, notes.
SNAP has about $6 billion in contingency funds; $9 billion is needed to cover the costs of the program through November. But the federal memo says that SNAP contingency funds cannot be used to float the program during the shutdown.
The federal judges authoring Friday’s court orders disagreed with the USDA’s argument that contingency funds couldn’t be used.
SNAP provides nutritional support for low-income seniors, people with disabilities living on fixed incomes, and other individuals and families with low incomes. Florida has the fourth largest SNAP enrollment nationwide with 2.94 million relying on the assistance for their food security, behind California, Texas, and New York.

Nationwide, 41.7 million people rely on SNAP benefits, August 2025 data show.
“I know they want this plane to come in for a landing, but let’s be clear,” Jones continued. “Right now, the White House, the House, the Senate and the courts are run by the Republican Party. They have the power – right now – to ensure that millions of Floridians – not only don’t go hungry, but they do not lose their health care. And the fact right now that Democrats are holding the line right now, for the fact to ensure that we don’t have a nation of sick people, I will continue to push the line that the federal government should do what’s right and feed the American people and stop bargaining with people’s lives.”
“Cruelty is the point”
State Rep. Angie Nixon, D-Jacksonville,  joined Jones on the Zoom call and said she was “happy and grateful” with the court rulings.  But she worries that the administration will appeal the rulings.
“Because at this point, cruelty is the point, right?” she said.

Florida legislative Democrats sent DeSantis a letter earlier this week calling on him to declare a state of emergency over the impending loss of SNAP benefits and dip into the state’s “rainy day” fund to help cover the costs of the program. They also asked DeSantis to direct the Department of Children and Families to work to distribute food to local food banks and their partners.
Legislative Democrats urge DeSantis to declare emergency, fill food pantries

DeSantis dismissed that request a day later.
“Did those Democrats write a letter to Chuck Schumer asking him to stop filibustering the spending?” DeSantis responded at a Tampa press conference on Wednesday. “Come on.”
Meanwhile, Florida’s congressional Democrats also hailed the Friday rulings
U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Democrat from Miami Gardens, called the ruling “good news and shows Republicans chose to illegally stop SNAP benefits this November.”
“The USDA must follow the court order and keep families fed. Now, Congress needs to come back to work, end the shutdown and save healthcare,” Wilson continued. 
U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, an Orlando Democrat, posted in part “Mr. President, the cruelty stops here. Food for our people should never be a political bargaining chip,” in responding to the ruling. 

Trump chose not to use emergency funds to feed over 40 million Americans. A federal judge just ruled that it’s against the law.

Oct. 31, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAround 50 individuals gathered in Portage, Mich. Friday afternoon, donning costumes and bearing treats, protest signs and handouts in opposition to the Palisades nuclear plant restart. 
Organized by a pair of anti-nuclear organizations, the “Zombies Against Palisades” protest aimed to call attention to several concerns as energy systems supplier Holtec International works to resurrect a previously defunct nuclear plant in Covert Township.
However the protest, located outside of Rep. Bill Huizenga’s (R-Holland Township) Portage office, also drew plenty of protestors in opposition to Republican policies and President Donald Trump’s administration. 
Speaking with the Michigan Advance at the first of two planned demonstrations, Kevin Kamps a radioactive waste watchdog for the anti-nuclear energy advocacy group Beyond Nuclear noted that the site was chosen both due to Huizenga’s support for reviving the plant and its location within the 50-mile emergency planning zone established to keep people and animals from eating contaminated food in the event of an emergency at Palisades.
While there are multiple paths to a potential meltdown at the plant, Kamps pointed to the plant’s steam generator tubes as one area of concern.

“They neglected to do safety maintenance for two years 2022 to 2024 making an already bad problem tremendously worse,” Kamps said, warning that if one tube blows, it will lead to a radiation release, while damage to enough of the tubes would result in a nuclear meltdown. 
An October 2024 report from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found that 701 tubes in one steam generator and 248 in another were candidates for plugging or repairs, noting that the amount of tubes with stress corrosion cracking far exceeded previous estimates.
Nick Culp, Holtec’s senior manager of government affairs and communications, told the Advance that repairs on the steam generator tubes were successfully completed this summer. 
“Both the sleeving on the Steam Generator primary side system and cleaning on the secondary side will help ensure the system’s continued safe and reliable operation,” Culp said in an email. 
While Culp said the plant is undergoing “rigorous inspections, testing, maintenance, repairs, and upgrades” in preparation for its return to operation, Beyond Nuclear and other anti-nuclear groups have challenged the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s decision to approve the steam generator repair plan. 
Michael Keegan, the chair of Don’t Waste Michigan, which was formed in opposition to a nuclear waste disposal within the state, noted Palisades had also recently exceeded its allotted limit for releasing hydrazine into Lake Michigan. Hydrazine is a highly toxic chemical and expected carcinogen, which Palisades uses in its steam generators.

In a notice to the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, Palisades noted that the release occurred during a scheduled cleaning of the steam generators. It also listed several changes in its cleaning process to prevent future releases.
Josef Greenberg, a public information officer for EGLE, said the Department has reviewed the incident report filed by the facility and will be requesting additional information related to the incident and report. If there is a need for any additional corrective actions, EGLE will make that determination after reviewing all data and responses submitted by the facility. 
Although Culp said the release brought no risk to the health and safety of Palisades’ employees, the community or the environment, Kamps retained concerns about the plant’s impact on the community’s health. 
“Lake Michigan is drinking water for shoreline communities. Yes, [radiation and toxic chemicals] may dilute as it expands out into the lake, but the South Haven drinking water intake is four miles away,” Kamps said, citing high rates of thyroid cancer amongst residents living in nearby communities.
Nancy Falk, a Kalamazoo resident and former Western Michigan University professor was among the costumed protestors speaking out against the Trump Administration. 
When asked what concerns were at the top of her mind, Falk said “For heaven’s sakes, everything.”
“Look, I’m 87 years old. I’m on Medicaid. I’m on Medicare,” Falk said. “I have a daughter, recently divorced, who is going to have to get new health insurance. So that’s a concern. I have another daughter whose job is disintegrating, who has a disabled husband and two daughters in college and one to go, so there are many, many very immediate concerns besides the long range one.”
A former comparative religions scholar, Falk also had concerns about the president’s approach to foreign policy. 
“Trump seems very good at turning on the United States friends while cuddling up to the United States long-term, if not enemies, maybe rivals,” Falk said. 
When comparing Trump to other presidencies she had lived through, Falk said “Trump is the pits.” 
“I thought Nixon was bad. Trump is much worse. Nixon, at least, I think, knew when his time was up,” Falk said.

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Stadard)The first item on every Washington voter’s ballot is a proposal to add a few lines to the state constitution that would change how billions of taxpayer dollars are managed.
Senate Joint Resolution 8201 seeks to let the state make stock market investments with payroll taxes collected for its long-term care program, known as WA Cares. Any earnings would have to be used solely for the program’s beneficiaries.
If approved Tuesday, the Washington State Investment Board would be legally able to handle the program’s assets in a similar manner as it does pension and retirement funds. 
This will allow for the tax dollars to be invested in a “safe and risk averse way” while producing greater returns for the program, said Heather Weiner of the Approve 8201 campaign in a recent debate at the University of Washington.
She said that since 1992, annual returns for Washington’s pension funds have averaged 8.9%, which is several percentage points higher than investments in government bonds. In the long run that would translate to a lot more dollars for the program.
“This doesn’t mean day trading, taking big risks on a stock market,” she said. “This means smart long-term [investing] so that in 50 years when people in this audience today will need long term care, that fund will be there for you.”
State Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Tukwila, opposes the measure.
“Our fiduciary responsibility is to the people,” he told the debate audience. “No one is going to know when the economy or stock market crashes. So, this vote is about whether we keep prudent fiscal management policies of our tax dollars and retain those constitutional protections.”
The Legislature voted earlier this year to put the constitutional amendment on the ballot. It passed by margins of 86-9 in the House and 42-7 in the Senate and will become law if more than 50% of voters approve it on Tuesday.
WA Cares, created by a 2019 law, is funded with a 0.58% tax on the paychecks of most workers in Washington. Beginning in July 2026, those who qualify can begin accessing the benefit, a lifetime amount of $36,500 — a sum that is set to rise in future years to account for inflation. A pilot program will start in January in a handful of counties.
Collections of the payroll tax began in mid-2023 and more than $2.5 billion was banked in the Long Term Services and Supports Trust Account as of summer.
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies. That means state and local governments are limited to fixed-income securities like government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit that are less risky but typically deliver lower rates of return. The WA Cares account is now subject to this limitation.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
If the constitutional amendment is approved, the long-term service account would be added to the list of funds exempt from that prohibition alongside the state’s pension and retirement funds. The state investment board could then decide if it wants to invest in private equity funds and buy stock of private companies, or not.
In 2020, voters defeated a similar measure. It passed in only three Washington counties — King, Jefferson and Whatcom.
Weiner said this year’s proposal, unlike the one in 2020, mandates money made from investments must go into the WA Cares Fund. The intent is to prevent lawmakers from tapping those dollars for other budget needs.
Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson and Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, back the ballot measure. So too do the Washington State Nurses Association, Washington State Council of Fire Fighters, AARP, and Washington Health Care Association.
Service Employees International Union 775 is underwriting the campaign. The union, which represents 55,000 long-term care workers in Washington, Montana and Alaska, had reported raising and spending $2.5 million as of Friday. That is five times more than it spent in a losing effort in 2020.
Hasegawa said there is no funded opposition campaign, just like the last ballot fight. He and three Republican state lawmakers penned the voters’ pamphlet statement opposing the measure.

Late Friday afternoon, Republican N.C. House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) announced the formation of a bipartisan “House Select Committee to Investigate Alleged Misconduct and Other Matters Included in Charges Against Representative Cecil Brockman.”
A little over an hour later, House Democratic leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) announced that Brockman had resigned. Reives lauded the move, which will help shore up Democratic defenses against a veto override in that chamber.
“The allegations against him are serious and made it impossible for him to adequately represent his constituents,” Reives said in a news release.
It’s now up to the Guilford Co. Democratic Party to name a successor to the seat.
Hall said Friday that Brockman’s decision to resign “is the right thing to do for his constituents and for the North Carolina House of Representatives.”
“His departure spares the House from a difficult expulsion process and brings closure to this troubling chapter,” Hall posted on X.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Brockman_featured.jpg,,,2025-10-31 18:03:25.902347

The executive order allows Wyoming’s governor to send emergency funds to charitable organizations, churches. 
The post Gordon declares public welfare emergency in light of SNAP lapse, OK’s $10 million in aid appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon declared a public welfare emergency Friday ahead of SNAP benefits lapsing Saturday amid the federal government shutdown. 
“When people can’t eat, and we’ve got dozens of people being turned away at food banks, and trying to find ways to feed themselves, I would qualify that as an emergency,” Gordon said during a press conference. 
Over 26,000 residents rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy groceries. But while the federal government is closed, the program will go unfunded, leaving thousands of Wyomingites, mostly children, at risk. 
The executive order issued Friday enables the governor’s office to send discretionary emergency funds to charitable organizations and churches to provide food via food banks and pantries. 
State law grants the governor the authority to spend up to $10 million from the legislative stabilization reserve account, also known as the rainy day fund, in the event of a public welfare emergency. 
SNAP benefits are distributed by the Wyoming Department of Family Services on a monthly basis to a reloadable EBT card, which functions like a debit card, for buying eligible food items. 
The state, however, is unable to move emergency funds to those cards “because we do not have a direct agreement with our provider who does the EBT transfers,” DFS Director Korin Schmidt told reporters. 
“So in the absence of that, we had to come up with a different methodology, which is to distribute the food or distribute dollars to food pantries, food banks so that they can purchase and provide food directly to our neighbors,” she said. 
As outlined in the executive order, DFS will provide grant agreements to those organizations “receiving funds and direct that they use reasonable efforts to purchase nutritional, healthy food with the distributed funds.” 
Gordon said officials anticipate spending about $1.4 million a week. 
“And may I add, this is not intended to supplant the excellent work that’s already being done by volunteers, churches and others all around the state,” Gordon said. “This is an adjunct to it, and we are trying to work as closely as we can to make sure that the needs are met.”
Meanwhile, Gordon signed an additional executive order Friday aligned with President Donald Trump’s “Make America Healthy Again” executive order, which directs DFS to begin the process of submitting a waiver request to further restrict what can be purchased with SNAP dollars. It targets foods such as candy and soda.
Earlier this month, the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee voted to adopt similar legislation. That measure must still pass the full Legislature, which convenes in February.

Tony Evers | Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin ExaminerGov. Tony Evers signed a bill Friday that will limit cell phones in schools, making Wisconsin the 36th state in the nation to do so, and a bill that will make it easier for candidates for office to remove themselves from ballots. 
A Wisconsin Policy Forum report from May found that most school districts already restrict student cellphone usage to common areas, though policies vary widely across the state.  
Under the new law, 2025 Wisconsin Act 42, school districts will have until July 2026 to implement a policy that bans cellphones during instructional times. The policy will need to include exceptions for emergencies, for educational purposes and cases involving student health care, individualized education plans (IEPs) or 504 plans (learning environment accommodations).
Evers said in a statement that the decision about whether to sign the bill weighed heavily on him, especially given his belief that “decisions like this should be made at the local level by local school districts”. However, he said he is “deeply concerned” about how cell phone and social media use are affecting students, including their mental health, school outcomes and social skills. 
“Our kids are struggling today, perhaps now more than ever. It’s really tough to be a kid these days, and we know that cellphones can be a major distraction from learning, a source of bullying, and a barrier to our kids’ important work of just being a kid,” Evers said in a statement. “While I wish the Legislature would have taken a different approach with this legislation, I will never stop fighting for Wisconsin’s kids and working to do what’s best for them, which is why I am signing this bill into law today.”
Evers also pointed to widespread support for cellphone ban policies in his statement. 
Pew Research recently found that 74% of U.S. adults support banning middle and high school students from using cellphones during class — an increase from 68% last fall. A Marquette Law School poll found that 89% of voters support banning cellphones during class periods. 
Evers also takes action on 19 other bills
Evers also signed Assembly Bill 35, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 43, to make it easier for candidates to withdraw themselves from a ballot. 
Under the law, candidates for office in Wisconsin will be able to withdraw their candidacy in a general or primary election and not be included on the ballot if they file a sworn statement. 
The change to Wisconsin law was proposed after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was not allowed to remove himself from the presidential ballot in 2024 after he dropped out and endorsed President Donald Trump. State law then said that candidates could only have their names removed if they were dead. 
The new law will allow candidates to remove themselves, but they’ll be responsible for paying the Wisconsin Elections Commission a $1,000 fee. Non-statewide candidates will need to pay $250. 
Under the law, a person could face a Class G felony with a maximum penalty of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years if they intentionally filed a false statement withdrawing a person’s candidacy. 
Evers also signed Senate Bill 309, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 41, which clarifies statute to say that 911 call centers and dispatchers who transfer a caller to the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline are generally immune from civil liability for any outcomes resulting from the transfer. 
“Our 911 dispatchers play a vital role in the safety and security of our state, but they often don’t have the time or resources available to provide the response necessary for somebody experiencing a mental health crisis,” Evers said. “By offering much-needed protection to 911 dispatchers who transfer calls to the 988 Lifeline, this bill allows for a better and safer crisis response by ensuring crisis calls go to the service providers who are trained to provide appropriate care and resources to those who need it most.”
The law specifies that the immunity doesn’t apply if an injury is the result of an act or omission that constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct by the dispatcher. 
Another bill signed by Evers, now 2025 Wisconsin Act 46, seeks to address the reckless driving issue in Wisconsin by allowing local governments to implement ordinances that will allow officers to immediately impound a vehicle used to drive recklessly and retain the vehicle until all outstanding fees, fines and forfeitures are paid.
Evers said in a statement that the law will “hold bad actors accountable” and help keep roads and communities safe.
“Whether it’s distracted driving, speeding, or erratic and aggressive behaviors, reckless driving puts our kids, families, and communities in harm’s way,” Evers said. “Tackling reckless driving has been a bipartisan goal in recent years, and I’m glad to see this trend has continued this session.” 
Evers also vetoed several bills. 

AB 5, which would have required school districts respond to material inspections requests within 14 days
AB 39, which would have required state employees to work in person for 80% of their week, 
A handful of bills — AB 162, AB 168 and AB 169 — that would have made changes to unemployment and workforce development programs. 
SB 25, which would have prohibited a court from allowing a complaint to be filed in a John Doe proceeding against a police officer who is involved in a shooting if the district attorney determines there is no basis to prosecute the officer. 
SB 184, which would have barred local governments from implementing restrictions on a cars and vehicles based on its energy source

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma officials said late Friday that a vote will be held Monday to give $1 million per week to Oklahoma’s food banks during the federal government shutdown, a fraction of what is needed.
Two federal judges ordered Friday that the Trump administration must continue providing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, also known as food stamps. The benefits are set to be cut off nationwide Saturday because of the federal government shutdown, affecting over 680,000 Oklahomans. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said in a joint statement that the funding will be provided from the state emergency fund, which is currently at $7.8 million, for up to seven weeks and will prioritize support for the most vulnerable SNAP recipients. The plan is contingent on a lack of federal funding for SNAP during the shutdown, according to a news release. 
It was not immediately clear Friday how this plan would be affected by the orders from federal judges or how the funding would be divided between Oklahoma’s food banks. 
The vote will be held 5 p.m. Monday at a Contingency Review Board meeting. Stitt, Hilbert and Paxton are the only voting members on the board. 
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because Congress has failed to find a bipartisan path forward on a stopgap spending bill by the start of the federal fiscal year. A Republican proposal seeks to temporarily keep the government open through Nov. 21. Democrats back a separate plan to permanently restore health subsidies for those who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
“This targeted emergency support, alongside the tireless work of our local food banks, will provide weekly food provisions to elderly, disabled, and child SNAP recipients across our 77 counties during periods in which SNAP federal funding is unavailable,” Stitt, Hilbert and Paxton said in the joint statement. “We encourage every business and nonprofit in the state to join us and be a neighbor to those in need during this time of uncertainty.
They asked Oklahoma’s businesses and nonprofits to contribute to food banks either financially or through lending their workforce. 
House and Senate Democrats and members of the legislative Black caucus on Friday morning called for a special session to use Oklahoma’s savings to fund SNAP during the shutdown. Oklahoma’s “rainy day fund” currently sits at more than $1.3 billion, but its uses are limited by state law. 
Stacy Dykstra, CEO of the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma, which serves 53 counties in central and western Oklahoma, said it will cost the group $5.5 million per month to double its efforts. It will also cost the Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma, which serves the rest of the state, the same amount to double their efforts. 
She said on Wednesday that food banks only provide one meal for every nine that SNAP provides. 
SNAP costs over $100 million per month in Oklahoma, according to a lawmaker. 
“Funding from the State of Oklahoma is extremely helpful as the Regional Food Bank for Oklahoma works to be as deliberate as possible to find every food resource we can and distribute it to our network in an intentional manner,” Dykstra said in a statement. “This amount represents only a fraction of what will be required; however, it will provide critical support allowing us to begin getting meals to the most vulnerable Oklahomans.” 
Jeff Marlow, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Eastern Oklahoma, said in a statement that while the funding will help reach some Oklahomans affected by the freeze in SNAP funding, a long-term solution will require immediate federal action to restore full support for the food assistance program.

As gridlock in Congress continues over the end of expanded health insurance subsidies, thousands of Vermonters will begin to confront an impossible choice about what to do in 2026: pay more or go without health insurance.

When the window to buy 2026 plans on Vermont Health Connect opens on Saturday, nearly 30,000 Vermonters will face what for many is an impossible choice: pay double or triple what they have been paying for their health insurance or go without.
Meanwhile, the federal government remains shuttered and Congress is gridlocked over extending the current subsidies that have made this insurance more accessible.
For Allison Mindel and her family, there is no real choice.

Since February, her 17-year-old son, Lei DeGroot, has been in intensive treatment at University of Vermont Medical Center for acute myeloid leukemia.
AML is a brutal cancer. It requires rounds of intense chemotherapy. It starts in the bone marrow and moves to the blood, which gives the cancerous cells a highway to spread throughout the body. 
Over the past seven months, Lei has spent a total of 174 days in the hospital. Mindel and her husband Matthew DeGroot split up the weeks, dividing time between their home in Worcester and UVM Medical Center’s inpatient rooms. In total, Lei has gone through five rounds of treatment,  cycling through one week of the system-blasting therapy, followed by three to four weeks of recovery, his immune system made raw and vulnerable to infection.
Two weeks ago, Lei was officially declared cancer-free. Last week, his central line for treatment was removed. The next day, he was able to go back to school in person.
On Friday, Mindel, her husband, and two of their children joined Sen. Peter Welch, Vermont hospital leaders and other families hit by the high cost of care in a press conference to advocate for the extension of the federal subsidies.
Mindel estimates that her son’s care cost between $1.5 million and $2 million. With the insurance her family of five has bought from Vermont Health Connect, she estimates they will end up paying $19,192 for the year: the $1,066 monthly premium for their top-tier MVP Gold plan, plus the $6,400 maximum deductible.
“When you’re [in the hospital] you see all the other people with all the other stories, and you realize, we are so grateful that we didn’t have to worry about our insurance coverage, and that it covered things.” Mindel told VTDigger. “There were so many other kinds of nightmare scenarios to worry about.”
Now, she is confronting a new nightmare as she weighs the costs of next year’s insurance. This coming year, without the enhanced subsidies for marketplace health insurance, the premium for the same MVP Gold plan will cost $3,386.47 a month — an annual total over $40,600.

Mindell runs her own consulting business, and her husband had worked for a small lobbying firm that didn’t provide its employees with insurance before he was laid off in July. He’s seeking a new job, but they are not optimistic he will find one that offers insurance for a full family anytime soon.
They can’t imagine going without health insurance. Her son will continue to need monthly blood tests and followup appointments, bone marrow biopsies, and expensive prescription drugs to manage and monitor his health.
“The care and the expenses don’t end,” Mindel said. 
Expanding affordability
The tax credits that made Mindel’s insurance — and the care it paid for it—affordable have only been available for a few years. They are on track to sunset soon, on Dec. 31, 2025. 
The 2010 Affordable Care Act, or ACA, laid the regulatory foundation for Vermont Health Connect, as well as the special marketplaces created by other states and the federal government for people to buy commercial insurance. The law also put in place a system of tax credits that have subsidized purchasing insurance plans for households making between 138% and 400% of the federal poverty level. (Anyone below that income level is eligible for Vermont’s Medicaid insurance program). 
In 2021, the American Rescue Plan expanded those tax credits, making ACA marketplace insurance plans newly affordable for millions of Americans, including thousands of Vermonters.
These “enhanced tax credits” became available to households earning more than 400% of the federal poverty line. The law capped the cost of premiums purchased by individuals and families on the marketplaces at 8.5% of a household’s income. Subsidies were also increased for many individuals already receiving credits, making health insurance premiums very low cost, or effectively free, for those households at the lowest income levels. 
In 2015, soon after Vermont Health Connect opened, 22,500 people on the marketplace received tax credits, according to an analysis by the Montpelier-based research group Public Assets Institute. Today, with the enhanced credits, that number is closer to 27,000. The amount each recipient receives in credits has jumped significantly in that decade as well: in 2015 a Vermonter’s average credit was $3,300. Today, that’s $11,400 in support, the Public Assets Institute found.
Without these expanded subsidies in the future, households will experience steeper costs in two different ways. Households making more than 400% of the federal poverty line will lose the subsidies entirely, and those under that income threshold, who will still receive subsidies, will see the amount of assistance shrink. 
Nationally, subsidized enrollees on the marketplace are seeing an average increase in their monthly premiums of about 114%, estimates the health news outlet KFF. 
In Vermont, the increase is even more stark. Because Vermont has some of the highest insurance premiums in the country, the state stands out as one of the states in the country poised to lose some of the most federal assistance — nearly $65 million, a 2024 report to the legislature found. Premiums for some families could increase nearly 300%. 
Vermont’s Health Care Advocate Mike Fisher outlined some examples of just what this means for families in the state during a mid-October legislative committee meeting. 
He said a family of three, for instance, earning $86,000 a year — 323% above the federal poverty level, would have paid $121 with the enhanced tax credits in 2025 for a standard Gold Plan through MVP and $330 for one from Blue Cross Blue Shield VT. This coming year, those same plans will cost $291 or $856, respectively.
Or, consider Cameron Chapman, a freelance writer and editor in Hardwick. 
In 2025, Chapman paid a little less than $500 a month for a Gold Plan through MVP, she told VTDigger. Next year, without the subsidies, the cost will increase to $1,135 a month for the same plan — more than she pays each month for housing.
Chapman is not planning on purchasing insurance at all next year and instead intends to put money aside each month and “keep (her) fingers crossed,” she said.  
At 41, she knows it’s a gamble, but one, for now, she is going to take. She plans to stop smoking this winter, eat more vegetables and get more exercise in an effort to keep her own healthcare costs down.
Her most expensive health care year, she says, was in 2022, when she was in and out of doctors’ offices trying to get a diagnosis for an ongoing issue. After 28 visits and nearly nine months of diagnostics, she estimates her care would have cost between $18,000 and $20,000 if she needed to pay out of pocket. That’s the same amount, she calculates, as what she would need to pay in 2026, counting $13,620 a year just in monthly insurance premiums, plus the plans’ $5,000 deductible. 
“I think for me, the biggest piece is not paying out money that I’m never going to see,” Chapman said. “I might as well take the money that I’ve been paying, put it into savings every month.”

‘A death spiral’
Insurers and policymakers expect that thousands of Vermonts will follow Chapman in her choice to forgo health insurance altogether. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has estimated that 3,017 members will drop their marketplace plans, while MVP (which operates in Vermont and New York state) estimates it will lose 22,052 members with the end of the enhanced tax credits.
That kind of shift not only hurts the individuals who go without insurance, but it impacts everyone else in the insurance pool, Fisher, the state consumer advocate, explained to VTDigger. The people who remain insured are generally those who cannot do without insurance and are less willing to take the gamble— individuals like Alison Mindel and her family.
“Health insurance is about spreading risk; it’s about all of us [being] in the same boat and only by all of us being in the same boat, that those of us who have real health care needs have a fighting chance of paying for it,” Fisher said. 
When fewer healthy people buy health insurance, insurers have to raise premiums to cover the costs of those remaining in the insurance pool. That’s because healthy people, generally, require less care and pay more money to the insurer than the insurer pays out for their health care. When insurers raise prices, more healthy people drop out. Policymakers literally call this a “death spiral.”
So, in addition to the loss of the expanded subsidies, people who buy their insurance on the marketplace are facing higher premiums that aim to accommodate this downward trend in enrollment. Nationwide, KFF, the health news outlet, calculates that —tax credits aside — the true cost of premiums across the country is increasing 26% in 2026.
In Vermont, for individuals and families, Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT plans will increase by 9.6%, while MVP’s will go up only 1.3%. Both increases are far less than what both insurers had initially requested from the state’s health care regulator. The difference in that increase is part of why MVP plans cost so much less than those from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, which has struggled with solvency, on Vermont Health Connect.
When people lose or forgo insurance, hospitals suffer too, Owen Foster, the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, told lawmakers at the mid-October meeting. People will still face healthcare emergencies regardless of whether or not they have insurance. When they do, they show up in a hospital’s emergency room. When hospitals provide care to these patients, most cannot afford the entirety of an out-of-pocket bill. So, when patients they treat don’t have insurance, hospitals are more likely to not receive payment at all. 
For Vermont’s already precarious hospitals, the loss of that revenue could be catastrophic. UVM Health, though a network of some of the state’s healthiest hospitals when it comes to revenue and cash reserves, could stand to lose up to $80 million in revenue with the end of these subsidies, estimated interim CEO Steve Leffler during Friday’s press conference with Sen. Welch.
“It’s a difficult cycle that we’re really hoping to avoid,” said Addie Strumolo, the deputy commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, which oversees Vermont Health Connect. “But, that is a real concern when you have affordability challenges, like the ones we’re anticipating for open enrollment, or other obstacles to being able to remain in coverage.”

Enrolling in a precarious marketplace
Strumolo’s team is trying to help people navigate this steep change in affordability ahead of, and during, the open enrollment period on Vermont’s marketplace.
Open enrollment runs, as it does every year, from Nov. 1 through Jan 15. But to secure coverage that begins on Jan. 1, 2026, individuals need to buy their plans by Dec. 15. 
Congress may approve a measure before the end of the year to extend the enhanced tax credits for 2026 health insurance plans. Strumolo said her department is ready to act quickly to get those credits to people who have already signed up for plans.
The federal government may also enact those measures later in 2026. If that happens, the state has the power to authorize a special enrollment period, she said. 
For now, the department has a plan comparison tool up and running. The interactive webpage allows people to see what the costs of various plans will be in 2026, incorporating whatever subsidies they may still be eligible to receive. 
“We think it’s really important for people to have coverage,” she said, even if that coverage is at a lower coverage tier “and so I think just knowing that there are options (is important).”
Fisher similarly encourages people to explore their options and shop around for one that fits their budgets. “It’s good for Vermont and good for Vermonters to have coverage, and I am afraid that many Vermonters are in plans they can’t afford,” he said. 
“I worry that many Vermonters will be forced into an economic choice or financing choice when we really want them to be making a healthcare access choice,” he said.
Alison Mindel is going into 2026 making a healthcare choice for her family, and hoping the financial details work out somehow. Knowing that the ongoing care for her son is going to continue to be costly, she and her husband intend to keep buying the Gold MVP plan, just without the enhanced premium tax credits. It will cost more than their mortgage.
“I don’t know how we’re going to manage paying for this going forward,” she said. “But, at the same time, I didn’t know how we were going to get through the past year either.”

A Rhode Island federal judge ruled Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) must use available contingency funds to cover food stamp funding while the lingering government shutdown leaves the program unsubsidized.
The federal government needs to submit a report by noon on Monday to the court, and explain how it will at least partially fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), colloquially known as food stamps, for the month of November. The agency must tap into $6 billion worth of contingency funding. 
“There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument, that irreparable harm will begin to occur, if it hasn’t already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,” Chief Judge John J. McConnell, Jr. said during a Friday hearing held over Zoom and livestreamed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.   
USDA also needs to explain if it will additionally cover the benefits by using Section 32 funding — an appropriated but flexible USDA fund created in 1935 that has been used to keep another food security program — the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) — afloat during the shutdown. The fund had over $23 billion in it as of Oct. 8, according to court documents.  
“It’s clear that when compared to the millions of people that will go without funds for food, versus the agency’s desire not to use contingency funds in case there’s a hurricane need — the balances of those equities clearly goes on the side of ensuring that people are fed,” McConnell said. 
A need for haste prompted the virtual hearing Friday for the case, which was filed in the court by a 20-plaintiff coalition led by the Rhode Island State Council of Churches. 
“Its unusual in a [temporary restraining order] that we do hearings publicly,” McConnell said, but added that the expected shutoff of food stamps on Saturday gave a valid reason for broadcasting a hearing that would normally happen behind closed doors.    
The named plaintiffs include the cities of Providence, Central Falls, Central Falls, Pawtucket, plus national groups and cities such as Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; Durham, North Carolina; New Haven, Connecticut; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The East Bay Community Action Program, United Way Of Rhode Island, and Amos House, are also plaintiffs. The legal team for the plaintiffs included attorneys from DeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry & Revens in Providence and Democracy Forward, a national group.

This just in from Boston
McConnell’s ruling came almost simultaneously with a similar outcome in a case in Massachusetts’ federal court. Near the end of the approximately hourlong virtual hearing, McConnell interrupted his own comments to remark that Judge Indira Talwani had just ruled on a case brought earlier this week by a coalition of states’ attorneys general, which also sought to reinstate SNAP funding, which is set to expire Saturday, Nov. 1, as it has not been allocated any emergency funding during the shutdown.  
Trump administration blocked from cutting off SNAP benefits as two judges issue orders

“I’m sure you’re all anxious to read Judge Talwani’s opinion,” McConnell said before he granted his own temporary restraining order on the government agency’s actions.
Like McConnell, Talwani ruled that the agency must submit by Monday whether it “will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.” If so, the USDA also needs to submit a timeline for its plan, and whether the SNAP money will come from contingency funds or other sources.  
McConnell said he was already familiar with the Massachusetts case assigned to Talwani. So, at the beginning of the hearing, he first gave the floor to Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General Tyler Becker, who represented the feds. A representative for the USDA attended part of the hearing but did not speak during her time on camera.
Becker argued for the nonexistence of SNAP without funding. That which is unfunded cannot exist, Becker proposed, because SNAP’s funding is what constitutes the program — therefore, a nonexistent program cannot receive contingency funding. 
“The government may not provide those benefits because there is not a funding allocation, an appropriation for those benefits, as a result of the current shutdown in the government,” Becker said. “It would be an extreme remedy at this point to force SNAP, the government, to rely on a contingency fund.”
“Those are to maintain program operations when there is a program,” Becker said. “There is no program.”
The argument did not persuade McConnell, who pointed out that a government shutdown does not automatically make a program defunct. This narrative has played out before during previous shutdowns, the judge recounted, and to different results.   
“SNAP benefits have never, until now, been terminated,” McConnell said. “The United States has, in fact, admitted that the contingency funds are appropriately used during a shutdown, and that occurred in 2019.”
Like the vast majority of cases involving President Donald Trump’s funding mandates, there was much talk of the “arbitrary and capricious” from both parties — the legal labels frequently invoked in anti-Trump litigation to indicate the administration’s non-specfiic or wide-ranging rationale for its funding directives. The plaintiffs’ legal team further argued that the federal government, in rejecting the use of contingency funding to keep SNAP afloat, ignored the very purpose for which those contingency funds had been created. 
Michael Torcello, a senior staff attorney with Democracy Forward, said the statute which authorizes SNAP includes “mandatory language that Congress uses when it intends to create a duty.”
“Congress foresaw that there might be an emergency, and it designated specific funds to be used in that situation,” Torcello said. “So I think that completely undermines the government’s position that there’s no funds at all that we could use. I think Congress very, very clearly and very directly contemplated that when there is a contingency or an emergency, ‘Here’s $6 billion that is to be used for this vital program.’” 
USDA’s decision not to use the contingency money, Becker argued, was within the range of discretion allowed the agency, especially since the current lack of funding is not an emergency proper.
“This shutdown is not an emergency,” Becker said. “This crisis, to the extent it is a crisis or an emergency at all, has been created by Congress.”
“It is something that could be, by Congress reopening the government tomorrow, could be resolved,” Becker added. “There is no mandate that the SNAP program actually be funded on Nov.1. …The government cannot just add funding when no program exists.”
Torcello offered a retort later in the hearing: “Counsel’s contention that the shutdown is not an emergency, although I think counsel also said that this is a crisis. So their position is a bit inconsistent on this.”
But Becker urged the court to leave the matter to Congress, as only an appropriation can restart SNAP issuance. Forcing USDA to issue November benefits with contingency or Section 32 money would misallocate carryover balances and “actually cause immense harm to the SNAP system itself.” The use of Section 32 money could also affect WIC’s shutdown funding. 
“I don’t think we’re even transferring into WIC for next month at this point, because there’s just a lot of considerations that go into this,” Becker said.

Focus on food driving cities’ resources
The plaintiffs’ legal team, meanwhile, was concerned about the harm that would come from the cessation of SNAP benefits. Approximately a quarter of the population of Central Falls receives SNAP benefits, said Democracy Forward Senior Counsel Jyoti Jasrasaria. She mentioned a food drive being held Saturday to help mitigate the shutdown’s effect on food stamps.  
“Doing that is requiring [the city] to divert resources and staff directly from the police department, the Department of Public Works and the office of constituent services, and it will continue to do things like that,” Jasrasaria said.  
Another portion of the plaintiffs’ argument involved USDA’s move to end existing work-requirement waivers for able-bodied adults without dependents. Congress’ overhaul of SNAP eligibility in July still did not OK retroactive cancellation, the attorneys argued, but that’s what an Oct. 3 memo by USDA tried to do.  
The Justice Department countered that no irreparable harm would come from the new waiver rules, because no recipients would see a change in benefits until March 1, 2026.
“The failure to honor existing waivers is contrary to law,” McConnell ruled from the bench. His ruling orders USDA to keep those waivers in place through their stated end dates while the case proceeds.
Attorney Kevin Love Hubbard appeared on behalf of DeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry & Revens — a stark change from July, when Hubbard still worked in  the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Division and defended the feds in court. Whether benefits expire in March or not does not make the time in-between any less important, Hubbard argued, as the time spent finding a job to satisfy the lack of a waiver cannot be returned. 
“Even if people are able to find jobs by March,” Hubbard said. “It eliminates their ability to use that time later on.”
“Time is our enemy here on so many levels,” McConnell said at one point.
Earlier in the hearing, he gave a “shoutout” to the courthouse staff who had stayed on with him to work on the case, which was filed less than a day before the hearing began.  
“I have two very, very tired law clerks, so I just want to publicly thank them,” McConnell said.

The group considered several kinds of mergers that would reduce costs across the state, including for school districts that provide families choice when there are public schools in neighboring districts.

Protect Vermont’s school choice system. That was the loud and clear message to the Vermont school redistricting task force during its Oct. 22 public forum at Rutland High School.
But some task force members see putting guardrails around school choice as one way to reduce costs for public education across the state.
At the same forum in Rutland, task force members also heard from Barstow school district board chair Debbie Singiser, who testified about the impact of school choice on her community. State taxpayers were “increasingly funding education for students with limited or only temporary ties to our community,” she told them.

Indeed, in the past five years, half of the 122 students who received public funding to attend private schools through Barstow Unified Union School District did not graduate from Barstow Memorial School’s 8th grade. And nearly half of the students using the tuition system from Barstow’s district in the past five years attended Killington Mountain School, a ski academy.
The data, compiled by task force members, supports Singiser’s comments at the public forum suggesting families are “moving into our school district to take advantage of that school choice and the tuition for high school.” That raises costs of taxpayers statewide, task force members argued.
“None of this is technically illegal. I mean, it’s just, is this what we want for our public school system?” Singiser said in an interview earlier this year. “We’re talking about how public education is getting expensive, and our property taxpayers are struggling, and when I look at that happening, I feel like we should fix that problem.”
During the task force’s Tuesday meeting, David Wolk, Gov. Phil Scott’s appointee to the task force, said it “shocked” him when he saw the data around tuition out of Barstow. He called it a problem that the Legislature “has got to change.”
“There has to be guardrails. There has to be some way to change this,” Wolk said. “It’s not right.”
As the state’s school redistricting task force continues its work to craft new school district maps, members are taking a microscope to the intricacies of the state’s 119 school districts and 52 supervisory union or supervisory districts, and highlighting some of the inefficiencies in school districts like Barstow.
The 11 members of the body have spent three months analyzing the state’s complex public education system, with one month left to go. The group is tasked with developing no more than three maps of new school boundaries for the Vermont Legislature to consider for the upcoming legislative session, which starts in early January.
So far, the task force has three map proposals in development. One creates 13 school districts to emphasize broader access to existing career and technical education opportunities. Another focuses on creating regional comprehensive high schools for underserved (and over-served) regions.
The third seeks to organize merged districts around regional BOCES, or a Board of Cooperative Educational Services, a type of educational governance entity used widely in New York and other states to help school districts collaborate on services such as special education and transportation.
That map, drafted by task force members Jennifer Botzojorns and Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, takes the first stab at highlighting in detail where the state could target mergers and why.
Among other suggestions for mergers is Barstow, which Botzojorns and Holcombe said could be absorbed by the Rutland City School District as a way to control costs.
But time is limited. The task force has only two meetings left before it is required to finalize a report with three maps. Rep. Edye Graning, the co-chair of the task force, on Tuesday called it a “herculean” task for the body.

“I just keep coming back to the time crunch. We don’t have enough time,” Graning said. “We just don’t have the time to do the work … with the quality and level of detail that we would all love to be able to do it in. It makes me sad, because this is a big deal.”
‘Half baked’
At the task force’s meeting on Tuesday, Botzojorn and Holcombe discussed three examples of areas where enrollment and resources were either declining or not being used efficiently, and where the state could look to merge districts.
These different cases were meant to show the kind of detailed analysis needed to determine where specifically to draw district lines in a way that both reduces the cost to taxpayers and increases access to opportunities for students, they said. 
Those merged districts would then be overlayed with cooperative education service areas to allow collaboration on shared expenses like travel and special education.
Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, listens to a presentation during a meeting of the school district redistricting task force in Winooski on Tuesday, Oct. 28. Chief Operation Officer Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
One example is typified by the state’s capital region, which “has a unique opportunity to coordinate” high schools in Barre, Montpelier and Twinfield, Botzojorn said.
This kind of area has “stranded costs,” where student enrollment was dropping faster than the disparate school districts’ ability to decrease costs. Costs at these school districts remained the same despite enrollment declines, putting financial stress on the overall system.
Merging districts could also improve access and save costs in districts like the Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union. There, public school funds are being used to pay tuition for private schools in choice systems, siphoning tax dollars spent by the state away from the public school, Holcombe and Botzojorn argued. 
In that supervisory union, the Winhall School District, a non-operating district, could be merged into the neighboring Taconic and Green School District to bolster overall enrollment and per-pupil-spending.
And in their third example, Holcombe and Botzojorn discussed areas with “sparsity loss,” where schools have become so small they may be considering closure. The proposal pointed to towns like Danville, Windham, West River, Twin Valley, Readsboro, Stamford and Halifax as examples. Merging in these districts would strengthen the isolated public schools, so they don’t close and potentially create regions with public school deserts.
Task force members on Tuesday also looked again at a map first proposed by Wolk and Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caldeonia, earlier this month. That map would create 13 school districts that closely mirror the state’s 15 career and technical education regions, each identified by the technical education center that anchors it.
The proposal aims to expand career and technical education opportunities to students and honor “school choice where it presently exists,” Wolk said.
A revised version tweaked some of the boundaries in existing districts, but little else was changed from the map’s first iteration. District sizes remained lopsided. One district covering Chittenden County and a part of Grand Isle County would have nearly 22,000 students, while the smallest, the River Bend Area District, would have just over 2,000 students.
Another proposal, developed by Holcombe and Jay Badams, would center a new map around comprehensive regional high schools.
By identifying and targeting construction aid at regional high schools, the state could incentivize neighboring districts to collaborate on the design and development of new regional high schools and potentially access state construction aid. Shared governance would then ensure communities retain a voice in how schools meet the needs of students, Badams said.
“If we were to designate the areas that we identify as likely sites for comprehensive public high schools, we could give (school districts) their own designation and give them priority in school construction funding and other things,” Badams said.
Badams, like the other presenters, called his proposal “half baked.” The exact number and location of the regional high schools has not yet been finalized. But he noted on Tuesday that the three map proposals shared so far all have elements that could be worked into each other. 
“I think if we could weave them together a little better, we might be on to something that can be actionable,” he said
All three proposals, however, have yet to address how new districts would be governed. Specifically, which district governance model would be used, supervisory districts or supervisory unions.
Both models provide back office functions such as accounting and payroll and may oversee the provision of special education services and curriculum coordination. But the two systems differ in their structure. Supervisory unions are made up of school districts that each have their own board of directors, while supervisory districts have only one governing board.
Badams called governance the task force’s stumbling block. “We have three maps on the table right now that don’t really get to the whole idea of governance in a way that was contemplated” by the legislature, he said.
“We’re tinkering,” he said. “We’re trying to make an omelette without breaking a single egg.”
The task force will continue to flesh out its proposals for their Nov. 10 meeting. Members are expected to vote on which maps to recommend to the legislature at its final meeting next month.
“None of us wants to upset anyone,” Graning said, “and at the same time, that’s what we’ve been asked to do, is to make recommendations.”

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A Pulaski County judge ordered House District 70’s special election moved to March 3, 2026, rejecting arguments from the state that Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has complete discretion over special election dates.
On Oct. 10, Sanders called a special election for June 9, 2026, to replace former Republican Rep. Carlton Wing, who resigned on Sept. 30 to become the new executive director and CEO of Arkansas PBS.

HD70 RULING-103125 
In a lawsuit filed Oct. 21, the Democratic Party of Arkansas and four District 70 voters said Sanders violated the state’s special election laws when she scheduled the special general election for that date. They called it “taxation without representation” as it would prevent the district from having House representation during the Legislature’s 2026 fiscal session, set to start in April.
The petitioners asked for the special election to be moved to March 3, which Sanders had set as the special primary, via a writ of mandamus. A writ of mandamus is a court order compelling a government official to perform a duty they are already legally required to do.
Under Arkansas law, the governor is required to schedule a special election date to fill a vacancy within 150 days unless she found it was “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so. Further, if the election couldn’t be held within 150 days, it had to be held on the earliest practicable date after that statutory deadline.
A June 9 election would be 252 days after Wing’s Sept. 30 resignation — or 152 days after the 150-day mark. The average number of days a special election has been held after the 150-day mark since 2011 is about 25 days, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
In Friday’s 18-page ruling granting the writ, Circuit Judge Shawn Johnson was not swayed by arguments from Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office that the governor has “complete discretion on how and when to set a special election — whether it is before or after the expiration of 150 days following a legislative vacancy.”
Johnson said that, while the governor was granted discretion to determine whether holding a special election within 150 days of a vacancy was “impracticable or unduly burdensome,” the exception required her to then schedule it on the “earliest practicable” date — not the “most practicable.”
And while “someone has to decide what date after the 150-day vacancy period is ‘as soon as practicable’ thereafter,” Johnson wrote, that person was not Sanders.
“If that were true, then it would render the statutory scheme meaningless. In other words, if the Governor has complete discretion over when to hold a special election — whether before or after the 150-day mark — then there would be no reason to have a 150-day limitation at all,” Johnson wrote.
Arkansas judge says ruling to come this week on second special election lawsuit

If the governor sets the date after the 150-day mark, the law takes away any discretion Sanders would otherwise have, Johnson wrote. After that point the special election date should depend on the ability of the locality to “well and capably accomplish the election.”
Johnson was also “not convinced” by Griffin’s office that state laws regarding absentee voting made the March 3 date proposed by the petitioners impracticable. He pointed to testimony from Pulaski County Circuit Clerk Terri Hollingsworth and other Pulaski County election officials, who stated they had successfully conducted a special election for House District 34 on nearly identical dates as those proposed by the petitioners.
“I am disappointed in the ruling and will expeditiously appeal the decision,” Griffin said in a text message via his spokesperson.

Johnson’s ruling is the second judicial decision to push back on Sanders’ recent special election proclamations. Another Pulaski County judge ruled against Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester earlier this month after a voter in Senate District 26 filed a lawsuit over an identical special election schedule, alleging that it violated state law and deprived the district’s voters of representation during the 2026 fiscal session.
However, that ruling did not go as far as Johnson’s did, only ordering Sanders to change the special election dates so it would occur prior to the April fiscal session.
‘Far-reaching ramifications’: Judge says special election dates violate constitutional rights

When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Sanders gave the same statement as was given after the SD26 ruling.
“Governor Sanders is confident that on appeal, the law clearly giving the Governor the authority to set special elections will be upheld and ultimately save taxpayer dollars and ensure the election is free, fair, and secure,” spokesperson Sam Dubke wrote in a text message.
DPA Chair Marcus Jones called the ruling a victory for HD70’s 30,000 residents.
“The time has come for Governor Sanders to move up the Special Election dates and give the hardworking taxpayers of North Little Rock and Sherwood the representation they deserve,” Jones wrote in an emailed statement provided to the Advocate. “The Democratic Party of Arkansas stands with Arkansans from across the political spectrum to oppose taxation without representation. Mark our words: We won’t stop fighting for every Arkansan to have a say in our state budget.”
Griffin’s office is appealing the SD26 ruling to the Arkansas Supreme Court as well, as is the plaintiff, who is asking the court to rule the 150-day exception unconstitutional, among other things.

Mike Braun threw his support behind Fort Wayne City Clerk Lana Keesling to chair the state GOP. (Photo courtesy Indiana Republican Party)Allen County Democrats want the Indiana Republican Party’s leader to resign from her publicly funded day job, arguing that holding both roles at once presents “conflicts of interest.”
Fort Wayne City Clerk Lana Keesling criticized the Allen County Democratic Party’s motivations in an open letter that revealed she plans to leave her city position soon — but not yet.
She ascended to the state GOP’s top job in February, becoming the party’s fourth chair in two years.
Indiana governor summons lawmakers for redistricting session amid national GOP pressure

County Democratic Party Chair Chad Wierzbinski said that, at that point, it was expected that Keesling “would follow the precedent established by previous Indiana Republican Party chairs who also served as elected officials, by resigning her elected position and releasing taxpayers from the burden of subsidizing a high-level political official.”
Kessling pushed back.
“The Allen County Democrats are simply trying to divert attention from their party’s abysmal track record in our city, state and nation,” she wrote in a missive addressed to Fort Wayne residents, which she shared with the Capital Chronicle.
Fort Wayne is the seat of Allen County.
County Dems point to redistricting and roles’ demands
Wierzbinski cited an impending special legislative session — called primarily for Indiana lawmakers to redraw the state’s two blue congressional districts red — as the impetus for a Friday news conference.
“I felt it was important to call this press conference today to shed light on how … Keesling is playing a role in disenfranchising voters,” Wierzbinski said, according to a news release.
The criticism went beyond Keesling’s support for early redistricting.
He commended her for visiting all 92 counties in less than a year as party chair, but said it’s “not a task befitting of a local city clerk.”
“The citizens of Fort Wayne deserve a full-time city clerk whose attention is singularly focused on the city, not someone spending her time at political events across the state while maintaining taxpayer-funded employment,” Wierzbinski said.
State GOP leader says commitment to city ‘has not wavered’
Keesling’s letter indicated she’s been planning for her departure since the month she was named GOP chair.
“I will continue serving my community, finishing projects in the office, and moving the office forward,” the note concluded. “Since February we have been working on a transition plan, and I look forward to sharing that plan soon.
Keesling began, however, by calling it an “honor and a privilege” to have worked as clerk for about a decade.
In 2015, she became the first Republican city clerk of Fort Wayne since 1971. She also previously served as vice chair of the Allen County Republican Party and treasurer of the 3rd District Republican Congressional Committee.

“During my time in office, my staff and I have transformed the City Clerk’s Office to become more efficient, effective and transparent along with being an office our community can be proud of,” the letter continued.
She highlighted the modernization of downtown Fort Wayne’s parking system — parking meters that accept credit cards, mobile app payment options and more accessible parking for the disabled — as “one of the accomplishments I am most proud of.” Those changes were made without the use of taxpayer dollars, according to the letter.
Keesling — who has served on a variety of boards for transportation, civil rights and disabled advocacy groups — said she was “humbled by the opportunity to serve Hoosiers in a different capacity” when Gov. Mike Braun asked her to lead the Indiana GOP.
“My commitment to the residents of Fort Wayne has not wavered,” she wrote. “My office and I continue to provide the highest level of service to our community each and every day, and I could not be prouder of the dedication and accomplishments of my team over the past 10 years.”

,California,2025-10-31 20:52:00+00:00,CalMatters,Head Start programs begin closing in California due to shutdown,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/10/california-head-start/,"As funding deadlines approach, one Head Start program has closed and three others are about to. More closures are expected in the coming weeks.","In summary
As funding deadlines approach, one Head Start program has closed and three others are about to. More closures are expected in the coming weeks. 


One California Head Start program has closed and three others face imminent closure due to the federal government shutdown, affecting about 1,000 very-low-income children and 270 teachers. 
The closures would leave families scrambling for child care and teachers without income. The longer the shutdown drags on, the more programs are at risk of shuttering. 
“Losing a Head Start program has detrimental effects not just on children and families, but also has immense ripple effects on the community,” said Melanee Cottrill, executive director of Head Start California. “Head Start is far more than a safe place for children to learn and grow — it’s a community hub … The negative effect on regional employment and the local economy would be felt many times over.” 
A Head Start program in Santa Cruz County has already closed, upending child care arrangements for hundreds of families.
Encompass Community Services, a Santa Cruz nonprofit, was forced to close all 11 of its Head Start centers on Thursday because no one at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was available to process the group’s Nov. 1 grant renewal or send money.
“Head Start is part of the fabric of this community,” said Elaine Johnson, chair of the Encompass board. “This is about babies, children, and families not having access to basic needs.”
The centers, mostly clustered in the farmlands around Watsonville, serve some of the lowest-income families in the region. About 300 children are enrolled in its program.
3,000 children at risk 
Three more Head Start programs in California — in Los Angeles, the Central Valley and the far northern part of the state — also have Nov. 1 grant deadlines and face imminent closure. Another four programs with Dec. 1 deadlines would be the next to shutter if the government shutdown continues. 
In all, more than 3,000 children and hundreds of teachers at those eight centers would be affected within the next month if Congress fails to adopt a budget.
Nationwide, about 134 programs serving 65,000 children face closure this week due to the shutdown — with Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Missouri having the highest numbers of children affected, according to the National Head Start Association. Even if Congress agrees to fund the federal government this week, re-opening would not happen immediately: It could take up to six weeks for the money to reach individual Head Start centers.
Popular and effective
Founded in the mid-1960s, Head Start is a free child care program providing meals and a play-based academic curriculum for children from birth through age 5. Families can get prenatal visits, referrals for medical and dental care, housing and job assistance and other services. 
To qualify, families must earn below the federal poverty level — $26,650 a year for a family of three. In California, that bar is very difficult to meet due to the higher minimum wage. Last year, the state’s Head Start centers enrolled about 83,000 children at 1,835 centers.
Head Start, created to give low-income families a boost, has largely been successful: Alumni have higher graduation rates, higher college-going rates and are less likely to live in poverty as adults, one study found.
It’s also very popular. When President Donald Trump threatened to cut the entire program this past spring, Head Start supporters flooded Congress with urgent pleas to save it from the budget axe. They succeeded, although other government cuts have left a deep impact on the organization and its families.
Potential cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Medicaid would have an immediate impact on Head Start families, while other recent cuts have already hampered Head Start’s day-to-day operations, Cottrill said.
The U.S. Health and Human Services Department, which oversees Head Start., closed half of its regional offices in April, leading to long delays in processing paperwork. For Head Start centers, that’s meant months-long holdups for routine purchases such as dishwashers, Cottrill said, along with delays related to minor program changes.
Back-up plans
In Santa Cruz, Encompass was able to partner with the Pajaro Valley Unified School District in Watsonville to temporarily provide child care to most of the families enrolled in Head Start, starting next week. But the past few months of budget uncertainty have been nerve-wracking, Kim Morrisson, interim executive director, said.
The organization has been in talks with a slew of state and local agencies to come up with back-up plans for funding the $9-million-a-year program..
“We’re trying to roll with the punches and just focus on serving our families,” Morrison said. “Head Start is a big, national program. We just can’t imagine a world where it doesn’t exist.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/120924_RalphHawleyHeadStart_FM_CM_22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)North Carolinians who plan to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace are set to see significant cost hikes as the open enrollment period begins Nov. 1.
That increase could soon be twofold. Providers are raising premiums by an average of 28.6% in North Carolina, and the tax credits that significantly lower costs for many enrollees are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress decides to extend them.
Almost 1 million North Carolinians are enrolled in the ACA, which provides federally-approved private health care plans to those without employer-sponsored insurance.
Around one-third (34%) of uninsured North Carolinians are eligible for Medicaid or public coverage, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data. And more than a quarter (28%) are eligible for tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year.
Individual rates in North Carolina will increase between 16.88% and 36.4% in 2026, Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey said in a statement Wednesday. Small group rates will increase between 12.66% and 17.5%.



Those hikes exceed national trends: the average proposed premium increase is 20%, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. That’s the highest rate change requested by providers since 2018, fueled by higher costs of labor, drugs and the uncertain future of tax credits.
“Increased costs in health care as well as the expiration of federal subsidies result in premiums going up for many on the individual market,” Causey said. “It’s more important than ever to begin researching your health insurance options early.”
A spokesperson for the NC Department of Insurance did not respond to inquiries about whether the department was seeing an increase in calls or concerns about rates ahead of open enrollment.
How politics have put ACA tax credits in peril
Providers have raised 2026 rates in part because of the looming expiration of enhanced premium tax credits. Those tax credits,established in 2021, were later extended through the end of this year. They have led to a massive expansion of the ACA marketplace, and drive down costs for many enrollees.
Earlier this year, Congressional Republicans voted to allow the tax credits to sunset on schedule, d saying they’re too costly to extend.
Congressional Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers, are using the budget continuation bill as leverage to convince Republican lawmakers to change their minds. In the Senate, Democrats are using parliamentary rules to block the passage of the spending bill unless it contains a provision to extend the ACA credits again.
So far, Republicans have refused to negotiate that issue. That’s what caused the current federal government shutdown standoff that has now dragged on for a month.
The standoff has fueled political battles around the country, including in North Carolina.
In a news conference Thursday, state Sen. Gale Adcock (D-Wake) said the majority party was “shutting down the government instead of fixing the health care crisis they created.”
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has called the tax credits “subsidizing bad policy.” He said GOP lawmakers “believe in the private sector and the free market and individual providers.”

Executives at the network said the change will make way for more news coverage throughout the day. 
The last broadcast of “Mississippi Edition” was Friday morning, according to a statement on MPB’s website. Starting Monday, MPB radio will air news segments at the beginning of every hour from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays.
Anna Neel, MPB’s chief operating officer, said the new approach will allow for more coverage of news as it develops.
“We’re hoping the new format gives reporters more flexibility to tell quality stories throughout the day,” Neel told Mississippi Today. “They’re not going to be as rushed to try to put together a 30-minute package.”
In July, the Republican-controlled Congress approved President Donald Trump’s request to cancel $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the nonprofit organization that helped fund the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. The corporation shut down when the federal budget year began Oct. 1. 
Mississippi Public Broadcasting is one of over 1,500 locally-owned radio and television stations that lost money. Neel estimated that MPB lost about 15% of its funding with the federal cuts. She said state funding and donors pay for MPB’s locally produced content, including state news coverage.
MPB continues to air emergency weather alerts along with local programming and will change its mix of PBS and NPR programming sometime next year, Neel said Friday.  She said MPB plans to add more local programming in the future.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/01164000/Mississippi-Public-Broadcasting-3.jpg,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Political analyst Amy Walter views the campaign by President Donald Trump to gerrymander congressional districts as a gamble unlikely to blunt historical precedent and prevent a Democratic takeover of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm election.
“I like to say in midterm elections there are three options if you’re the party in the White House. It’s going to be bad. It’s going to be really bad. Or, it’s going to be catastrophically bad. There is nothing else that is likely,” she told a crowd Thursday at Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas.
Walter, publisher of Cook Political Report and a guest on PBS NewsHour, NBC’s Meet the Press, CNN’s Inside Politics and the Fox News Channel, said Trump would be a substantial motivator in terms of Democratic turnout in the midterm scheduled for one year from now. It’s unclear whether Trump could likewise inspire dramatic turnout among GOP voters in November 2026, she said.
“Midterm elections are a referendum on the party in power,” Walter said. “The challenge for a president is to turn out his winning presidential coalition.”
Walter said at this moment it might be possible for Republicans to expand by a half dozen or so the number of seats in the U.S. House through redistricting. Those gains are unlikely to compensate for anticipated losses by other GOP House candidates, she said, but politics of the midterm could be unpredictable.
Walter was interviewed at Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas by Jerry Seib, a journalist with The Wall Street Journal for almost 45 years. He said the unprecedented redistricting battle illustrated what Trump’s advisers expected in the upcoming election cycle.
“That tells you that the White House, Trump-world, is worried,” Seib said.
Walter said a Democratic Party majority in the House or Senate would use committees to challenge Trump’s use of executive power or investigate the president’s actions.
“The president also knows quite well the last time Democrats were in charge while he was there, they impeached him twice,” Walter said.
Trump’s plan for mid-decade redistricting has created political turmoil in Kansas, where Republican leaders of the Legislature want a special session to realign the state’s four congressional districts. The goal would be to pull the re-election rug out from under Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, who serves the Kansas City area.
 
‘Battle for control’
In the U.S. House, Republicans hold the smallest majority since 1931. If Democrats flipped three seats in the midterm, Republicans would lose control of the chamber.
The 53-47 U.S. Senate could change hands if Democrats secured four additional seats, but Walter said that Republican majority appeared to be solid because opportunities for Democrats were limited in 2026. If Democrats failed to grab the Maine Senate seat held by Republican Susan Collins, in a state won by Democrat Kamala Harris, there could be no path for Democrats, she said.
“The battle for control of Congress is something that is very consequential, especially if your party currently has all three branches and it’s a lot easier to get a whole lot done when you don’t have to negotiate with your opposition,” Walter said.
The historical record revealed in 18 of 20 midterms since World War II the party of the sitting president lost an average of 27 seats in the U.S. House during midterm elections.
The two exceptions came after the 2001 terrorist attack under President George W. Bush and amid President Bill Clinton’s impeachment controversy in 1998.
In those rare midterm elections, Bush and Clinton had robust approval ratings of at least 60%. Recent polling indicated 43% of Americans approved of Trump’s performance in the second term. That’s the statistical territory Trump occupied in the 2018 midterm when Republicans lost 40 seats in the U.S. House.
 
Feckless Democrats
Walter said the biggest wild card in 2026 was the gerrymandering of U.S. House districts to benefit either Republican or Democratic candidates. Texas and California would cancel each other out, so it could come down to the Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri and North Carolina.
Walter said another complicating factor in sorting out the next midterm was the Democratic Party lacked fervor of a decade ago.
The position of Democrats in the federal government shutdown was driven by criticism from Democrats who questioned what lawmakers were doing to push back against Trump, she said.
“That is driven in large part by pressure from rank-and-file Democrats who say, ‘What are our leaders doing? They’re feckless. Why don’t they fight back more against Donald Trump?’ There is this worry among Democrats that their weak party brand big and this intraparty friction may have an impact on turnout,” she said.
Another factor could be timing of a U.S. Supreme Court decision on whether the Voting Rights Act required districts with a majority of minority residents. The outcome could come too late in 2026 for states to adjust boundaries before candidate filing deadlines, she said.
 
Trump in 2028?
Walter said Congress wasn’t going back to a past era that included a spirit of bipartisanship.
“It’s pretty clear that more and more we do have two Americas,” she said. “The job of the parties now seems to be more of, ‘How can I make sure my America turns out to vote and crushes their America.'”
To put it another way, she said: “The idea of the two sides figuring out, ‘Alright, well, this is a priority and let’s work on a bipartisan bill to address it. It seems pretty far-fetched.”
In response to an audience question, Seib and Walter said they doubted Trump would have the audacity to seek a third term as president during 2028 in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
“I think this is a tease right now. I think that even for Trump it would be a bridge too far,” Seib said. “Why? If you think you’re having a wonderful second term and you’re going to go on Mount Rushmore, why would you want to tarnish your legacy by starting a fight with the Supreme Court you’re probably going to lose.”
Walter: “I absolutely agree with you.” She theorized there was no longer a Republican Party in the United States, because it should be regarded as a Trump Party. “Whether it is the name Donald Trump on the ballot in 2028, or someone else, they will come from Donald Trump and he will endorse that candidate and they will be the nominee.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Federal judges in two separate cases, including the multistate lawsuit that Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined on Tuesday, have rejected legal arguments made by the Trump administration against releasing emergency funding for November food assistance.
In Massachusetts District Court on Friday, Judge Indira Talwani said Clark and colleagues from 24 states and the District of Columbia were “likely to succeed” in their claims against the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Though Talwani stopped short of issuing the temporary restraining order sought by states against the USDA, in an order on Friday she found the USDA’s argument that existing contingency funding is not legally available for its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program “erroneous.”
“While this case isn’t over, today is a good day in our fight,” Clark said in a statement on Friday following Talwani’s order.
Talwani gave federal officials until Monday to “advise the court whether they will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.”

In a separate decision in Rhode Island District Court, Judge John McConnell ordered the Trump administration to use its contingency funding to continue distributing food benefits. McConnell ruled in favor of a group of city officials and community organizations, who sought a temporary restraining order against the USDA’s actions along the same lines as Clark’s lawsuit.
“Two federal courts today told the Trump Administration what they are doing with SNAP benefits is wrong,” Clark said in her statement. “I couldn’t agree more and we will keep fighting.”
These decisions occur as Vermont takes steps to provide state-funded stopgap measures while federal funding remains in question for food assistance. 
On Wednesday, the state’s Emergency Board approved a $6.5 million plan that funds 3SquaresVT — Vermont’s version of SNAP — for the first half of November. The board will reconvene on or before Nov. 13 to weigh further steps.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, in coordination with the Tangipahoa Parish government, reopened the southernmost portion of the river Friday. The span ranges from the unincorporated community of Lees Landing down to the river’s mouth in Lake Pontchartrain, according to an LDEQ news release. A far larger section of the river, stretching north from Lees Landing to Louisiana Highway 10 in Arcola, remains closed until further notice.

Officials closed the Tangipahoa River following the Aug. 22 chemical fire at the Smitty’s Supply Inc. facility in Roseland. It took firefighters two weeks to fully extinguish the blaze. The disaster  contaminated nearby properties, land and waterways with millions of gallons of oil and other hazardous chemical products. To date, cleanup crews have recovered more than 11 million gallons of liquid waste, according to state estimates. 
Cleanup operations continue in other parts of the river north of Lees Landing, and oil absorbent boom will remain in place at select locations, the LDEQ statement said.

(Patrick Lohmann/SourceNM)Leaders of New Mexico’s largest food banks said they’re seeing sharp increases in demand for food donations in distribution lines amid the looming disappearance of federal food assistance funding beginning Saturday.
Approximately 250 people lined up Friday morning at the weekly Roadrunner Food Bank distribution in Albuquerque ,about 100 more than usual, organizers told Source New Mexico. 
And earlier this week in Santa Fe, The Food Depot ran out of food after serving 135 people at a distribution that typically serves less than 100, Executive Director Jill Dixon told Source in a text message.
Organizers said the uptick in demand reflects the widespread uncertainty about what the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will look like beginning Nov. 1. 
Trump administration blocked from cutting off SNAP benefits as two judges issue orders

Two federal judges issued orders Friday that block the Trump administration from cutting off SNAP benefits. In one case, the judge gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her findings. 
On Wednesday Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced $30 million in emergency funding to cover SNAP recipients through approximately the first 10 days of the month.
Over the weekend, the state’s roughly 460,000 SNAP recipients will receive a payment equaling 30% of their typical monthly food assistance benefit, Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo told Source New Mexico on Friday in a phone interview. The money will arrive to all SNAP recipients, including those who typically receive their benefits later in the month.
Recipients can expect text messages soon with more details, as well as phone numbers to call in case issues arise, she said. 
“At this point we are not anticipating any delays,” she said. “We’re telling New Mexicans that if they don’t have their benefits by Monday, they should give us a call.”
As they stood toward the front of a growing food line around 9 a.m. Friday morning in Albuquerque, Keith Pounds struck up a conversation with Jeana Morgan and her son Jimmy about how they’re going to feed their families in November. They could be overheard planning how to make do with one-third of what they typically rely on in November amid rising grocery prices.

“Something’s better than nothing,” Jimmy Morgan said. “Yeah, it’s something,” his mother said.
But Pounds, who is disabled, said he is supporting his three brothers, who’ve been unable to get food assistance. He worried aloud about how they’ll all eat in November. 
“I try and catch every food bank I can, even with my feet and my legs the way they are,” he said. “Life is hard, dude. You can’t afford to eat.” 
Armijo also told Source on Friday following the federal rulings the state will still proceed with  payments because she anticipates at least a few days before the money arrives here, even if Trump accedes to the judicial orders.
“That could really eat into next week,” she said. “And so in order to make sure that New Mexicans have food on the table over the weekend, we’re going to issue those benefits.”
Even with those benefits, Joseph Greenwood, a programs manager at Roadrunner Food Bank, told Source that the food bank expects continued high demand through November. He looked over the growing food line Friday and said it reminded him of lines during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

He anticipated the food bank would give out an entire truckload of food by noon. 
He said the state’s $30 million stop-gap, along with an $8 million investment for statewide food banks the Legislature approved during a special session at the beginning of the month, provide a “shot in the arm” to help feed New Mexicans, but it’s doesn’t come close to satisfying statewide hunger needs.
But Edmundo Maestas, who grew up in the International District, was relieved to learn Friday morning from a reporter that the state would give him about $35 for food over the weekend. Even though it’s one-third of what he normally gets, he thought he wasn’t getting anything through Thanksgiving.

Phaneuf and Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/31/trump-ordered-to-pay-snap-benefits-ct-officials-still-want-to-help/,The rulings didn’t stop CT state legislators’ demands to reserve hundreds of millions to shore up SNAP and other human service programs.,"Two federal judges ruled separately on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.
The judges, in federal courts in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program fully or partially in November. The U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to stop SNAP benefits entirely for 42 million Americans — including 360,000 Connecticut residents — starting Saturday.
Those rulings, though, didn’t stop Connecticut state legislators’ demands to reserve hundreds of millions in state funds to shore up SNAP and other human service programs harmed by stalled federal aid.
Gov. Ned Lamont and state legislative leaders indicated Friday they would continue negotiating a plan to use Connecticut resources to ensure all vulnerable residents are protected.
In U.S. District Court in Boston, Judge Indira Talwani ruled in a written opinion that the USDA must pay for SNAP, calling the suspension “unlawful.” She ordered the Trump administration to advise the court by Monday as to whether it would use the contingency funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the program using both contingency funds and additional available funds.
The SNAP program entered October with about $6 billion in contingency funds, though that reserve likely now stands between $5 billion and $6 billion, with some used to cover SNAP administrative costs in October. A partial federal government shutdown starting Oct. 1 has blocked any new funds into the program.
But Talwani noted federal agriculture officials could supplement those dollars with customs receipts on all imports, which might allow for full benefits to be paid in November.
Meanwhile, in U.S. District Court in Providence, Judge John J. McConnell ruled from the bench in a case filed by cities and nonprofits that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds, and he also asked for an update on progress by Monday.
Still, it wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy food could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.
And the rulings are likely to face appeals.
Connecticut officials applauded the rulings Friday but acknowledged the SNAP crisis is far from over.
“Donald Trump now has a stark legal and moral choice before him — he can keep fighting this losing battle, he can insist on starving American families for political leverage, or he can release the funds now,” said Attorney General William Tong.
Connecticut, 24 other states and the District of Columbia filed the lawsuit heard in federal court in Boston, arguing the White House has a legal and a moral obligation to spend contingency funds at least.
“While this ruling may offer last-minute relief for the many who rely on SNAP, I urge the federal government to honor it now and for [Agriculture] Secretary [Brooke] Rollins to use not only the department’s contingency fund but also her transfer authority to increase benefits,” Lamont wrote in a statement shortly after the rulings, adding that state social services officials would issue November benefits as soon as the USDA authorizes payments.
“In Connecticut, we take care of our own and will continue to stand by our residents until this federal shutdown is resolved,” the governor said.
But state legislative leaders from both parties have chastised the Democratic governor this week, saying he did too little to prepare for a benefits stoppage that had become evident weeks ago.
Lamont dedicated $3 million for an emergency grant to support food pantries while governors in several other states dedicated tens of millions of dollars in provide state-backed food benefits to replace the vanishing federal aid to needy households.
State House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said they both remain committed to designating a huge state reserve, likely involving hundreds of millions of dollars.
This could be used to replace stalled federal SNAP benefits if federal court appeals lead to more delays, or if federal contingency funds eventually are exhausted. With the General Assembly expected to go into special session on Nov. 12-13, legislative leaders say they want to ensure enough state reserves as designated to protect programs, if necessary, until the regular 2026 legislative session opens on Feb. 4.
“This is about more than just SNAP,” Candelora said. “I think that we need to act as if this government shutdown is going to continue.”
And even after the shutdown is over and federal agency operations return to normal, Ritter said, many state legislators also want to review human service programs that face ongoing reductions in federal funding in 2027 and 2028 due to cutbacks ordered by Congress in July.
“The shutdown has only made it more important to do this [reserve] fund,” Ritter added. “It’s not just SNAP that’s at risk.”
Some state legislators already have said they want to bolster Connecticut’s winter heating assistance grants, which traditionally have been paid using only federal aid, with some state funding.
Lamont, a fiscal moderate, has traditionally objected to using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government, a stance that sometimes leaves him at odds with his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority.
State Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden, who is challenging Lamont for the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial nomination, said Friday the fiscally moderate governor would find himself at odds with nearly the entire General Assembly unless he agrees to dedicate more state dollars to help feed hungry families and keep homes heated this winter. Simply giving $3 million to food pantries, Elliott said, won’t cut it.
“It would astonish me, given the amount of suffering that we’re hearing from our constituents across the board, that we wouldn’t have super-majorities in both chambers” ready to spend state funds on nutrition and home heating assistance, Elliott said.
The Hamden lawmaker said the legislature should even consider a state tax rebate if that is the only way to get extra resources in November to poor families that cannot afford groceries.
The average Connecticut household on SNAP receives about $324 per month, or about $81 per week.

During a special meeting Friday the DMACC board of directors appointed Liang Chee Wee as the college’s interim president, with his term set to run from Jan. 1 through June 30, 2026. The vote was nearly unanimous, with board member Angela Jackson abstaining because she said she didn’t have time to review Wee’s resume.
Some members of the board met with Wee earlier this week, board president Kevin Halterman said during the meeting, and they were impressed with his willingness to get involved in DMACC life and keep the institution moving forward during his tenure.
“I am very positive about his appointment as our interim,” board member Trish Roberts said.

When DMACC first launched a national search for President Rob Denson’s successor after his retirement at the end of 2025, the plan was to select a new president who would take over at the start of the year. However, after two of three finalists for the presidency dropped out, the board decided to extend the search into next year and hire an interim president in the meantime.

Wee has led multiple Iowa community colleges in the past, according to a news release announcing his appointment, including more than a decade of serving as president of Northeast Iowa Community College and two years of being interim chancellor of Eastern Iowa Community Colleges.
As he is currently living in Decorah, Halterman said during the meeting Wee will look for a residence in the Des Moines area to have “boots on the ground” at DMACC during the week. Wee will consult with the college’s senior team members on practices like hiring during his time at the college, Halterman said, and he will assist in representing the college and its needs during the legislative session.
He also agreed with board members that DMACC is a large institution and “we should not slow down the ship,” board member Felix Gallagher said during the meeting.
“DMACC is a remarkable institution with outstanding students, faculty, and staff,” Wee said in the release. “I am honored to serve in this interim capacity and look forward to supporting the College’s impactful mission of providing accessible, affordable, and outstanding educational experiences while working alongside the talented DMACC community.”

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansans purchasing health insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace are likely to see their premiums increase in 2026, some by as much as 34%, and that’s without calculating the additional dollars they will pay if subsidies aren’t reinstated by Congress. 
ACA marketplace open enrollment starts Saturday for 2026 insurance plans, and Kansans are concerned about what to expect after seeing national estimates that health insurance rates may double. 
Health insurance rates are going up across the board, and many factors contribute to that, including use, cost of care and advances in types of care, increased prescription costs and renegotiated provider reimbursement contracts, said Kyle Strathman, deputy chief of staff at the Kansas Department of Insurance. 
On the marketplace, Kansans also are being hit with the expiration of 2026 marketplace subsidies, said Maci Mishler, owner of Rural Health Advisors, a health insurance agency in Ness City and with an office in Nebraska. 
“I’m really concerned that people in the marketplace have their heads buried in the sand and they’re not realizing what’s about to happen,” she said, adding that she’s getting more calls from clients about Medicare rates than from those who buy marketplace insurance. 
 
 Kansas ACA

Of the seven companies offering ACA coverage in Kansas, one is new to the market and has no previous rates to compare. Another, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, showed an average rate decrease of 6.14%, according to the Kansas Department of Insurance’s 2026 overview of the health insurance market, released Thursday. 
The remaining five reported the following average rate increases among 2026 marketplace plans:

11.74% – UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co.
14.44% – Oscar Insurance Co.
16.65% – Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas Inc.
30.76% – Medica Insurance Co.
33.66% – Ambetter from Sunflower Health Plan insured by Celtic Insurance Co.

The four companies offering small business insurance plans through ACA reported that rates will increase, on average, from 8.4% to nearly 10%, the study found. 
The insurance market study also said the numbers of Kansans using the marketplace have steadily increased, topping 200,000 in 2025, up from 171,000 in 2024. In 2017, 98,780 people were enrolled. 
Strathman said it’s challenging to predict how the insurance market will be affected. National experts expect many people who see significant cost increases to go without insurance. 
“It is difficult to project as we do not know if people will leave the ACA for other options such as short-term limited duration plans or group plans, but projections of enrollment to the individual ACA plans are expected to decrease significantly,” he said. 
A decrease would negatively affect the market, as insurance companies depend on the number of people enrolled to decrease risk, Mishler said. 
Cindy Samuelson, spokeswoman for the Kansas Hospital Association, said any decrease in the number of Kansans who have health insurance is concerning. 
“When they’re uninsured, that’s not good for their health care because they don’t get proactive health care,” she said. “It also means when they have urgent care, they’re going to come to the emergency room, and they’re uncompensated, so they have no insurance.”
When hospitals face rising uncompensated care costs, those challenges begin to affect the entire medical system. Kansas has the highest number of rural hospitals at immediate risk of closing of any state, at 25 hospitals, according to the March 2025 report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.
 
Hitting Kansans’ budgets
Kansan Laura Mead is self-employed, and she’s nervous about what to expect from her marketplace plan when she sees rates on Saturday — that’s even after an initial exploration showed her annual health insurance cost may decrease. 
At age 60, she currently pays about $1,100 a month for health care through ACA, which she says has an actual premium of $1,427 a month. The additional $327 is covered by the ACA subsidies, which are ending unless Congress takes action. 
“For the first time in my adult life, I’m facing a real serious prospect of not having health care,” she said.
After researching, Mead said she expects that her insurance costs may double, which would leave her paying an unsustainable $2,000 each month. 
Mead is considering a catastrophic policy, which would cover her if a significant health problem occurred. She’s frustrated at how difficult it is to weigh her options. The ACA marketplace can be confusing, she said, and she’s finding that even Kansas U.S. legislators don’t understand what’s happening. 
She called one representative’s office and the staff person told her that “we’re trying to get people who aren’t working off those programs,” Mead said. 
Carolyn McKee, a small business owner in Holton, posted on Facebook Friday that she received a letter saying her private Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan would increase by $700 a month. Within an hour, her post had more than 40 comments, with some complaining they were also seeing their rates double. 
Many self-employed individuals like McKee and Mead, including an estimated 27% of farmers, get their health insurance through the marketplace. 
 
More than subsidies
Mischler said people need to also be aware of the “cliff” that’s part of ACA marketplace rules, as that will also affect many Kansans. 
“Pre-Covid, if you had income over 400% of the federal poverty level, you weren’t going to qualify for a subsidy at all,” she said. “Then during Covid, they expanded subsidies and even people who made a ton of money could qualify for some subsidies.”
Mischler said consumers have gotten used to paying those reduced rates for health insurance and that 400% requirement is now going back in place. 
“That’s going to hit hard, right now especially,” she said. “Even if we estimate their income as under that 400%, if they make one penny over that 400%, then they’re going to pay back all the subsidy that they’ve received at tax time.”
With farmers and others who are self-employed, it can be difficult to estimate income, and Mischler said she’s concerned about people needing to repay thousands of dollars in subsidies. 
 
Political chaos
The government shutdown is tied to the ACA marketplace subsidies, with Democrats saying they won’t support a spending bill until Republicans agree to continue marketplace subsidies set to expire at the end of the year. 
Republicans maintain the Democrats are fighting to keep undocumented immigrants on ACA marketplace insurance. The right-wing group Public Policy Solutions posted on Twitter — and Kansas Speaker of the House Dan Hawkins reposted — that “Democrats chose to shut down the government to fund healthcare for illegal immigrants and keep pandemic-era ObamaCare subsidies flowing to insurance giants.”
Anyone who isn’t in the country legally is not eligible for marketplace insurance.
Gov. Laura Kelly, during a press conference Friday in her role as chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association, called on Congress to return to session and reinstate ACA subsidies, as well as address Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits that are delayed because of the federal shutdown. 
“We’re here today because our country is at a dire inflection point starting tomorrow,” she said. “Twenty-two million Americans will wake up to see their health care premiums increase by an average of 75%, and 42 million people will lose SNAP benefits and go hungry because DC Republicans sold them out at the behest of Donald Trump.”
Rural communities will be hit the hardest, she said, noting that “dozens” of rural health clinics nationwide have shut down. She also said that Freeman Health System’s plans in Kansas to build a new hospital in Frontenac have been dropped. 
In a statement three weeks ago, Freeman said conditions weren’t feasible to open the hospital at this time, pointing to changes in the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kansas-Ins-Dept-1024x562.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949

On Monday, the Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) announced that benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will be suspended in November. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the program, said it would not pay benefits starting Nov. 1, and would also not tap into a contingency fund to pay benefits, even removing mentions of the plan from its website. 
More than 726,000 Alabamians rely on the service, according to DHR, about 15% of the state’s population.
A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday ordered the USDA to continue paying SNAP benefits through November. It was not immediately clear if the Trump administration would appeal the ruling. 
Local providers prepare
Elmore County Food Pantry has provided more than 25 emergency boxes to furloughed federal employees and SNAP recipients in the last two days, director Jade Skinner said on Friday. Typically, she said the pantry distributes one emergency box per week.
“Anytime someone comes in and says, ‘Hey, I really need help, this is what’s going on.’ We’ve got a box ready for them, for their family members,” Skinner said in an interview Friday.

According to data from DHR, about 8,100 (8.9%) Elmore County residents received SNAP benefits in September. The food pantry serves both SNAP recipients and those that make less than 185% of the poverty level. That’s an annual income of about $28,900 for an individual and $49,000 for a family of three.
The boxes come to the food pantry from Heart of Alabama Food Bank, each filled with 25 pounds of food for families. Skinner and volunteers add an additional 25 pounds of food to each box.
“In my opinion, that’s not enough for a family to get by with. It’s probably four or five canned goods, two cans of peanut butter, a big thing of applesauce,” she said. “What we’re doing is taking from our inventory and our supply and beefing those boxes up. We’re giving them like some rice, some pasta, dried beans, frozen meats, to supplement and get them by.”
The food pantry allows its customers to shop like a grocery store once every month for free, but there are limits on how much of each item can be taken. Skinner said the pantry usually has about 600 shoppers every month, with each one getting 150-165 pounds of groceries.
With the influx of need, Skinner said the pantry needs volunteers, donations, monetary and items, but to prioritize donating food that could be used more than once.
“When someone donates money to us, we can buy in bulk from the Heart of Alabama Food Bank, and $1 can provide five to six pounds of food. Whereas, if you or I were to go to the grocery store and buy just a simple can of food, it’s going to be $1 and some change,” Skinner said. “We accept food and monetary donations but, monetary donations go a lot further.”
A message seeking comment from the Heart of Alabama Food Bank was left Friday.
West Alabama Food Bank is another food pantry that has seen increased operations.
“We have increased our mobile pantries. Instead of doing three a week, we’re doing between five and six a week,” West Alabama Food Bank Director Jean Rykaczewski said Friday.
Rykaczewski also said grocery stores across the state are offering deals for SNAP recipients and said those who still have funds available will be able to use them.
“The SNAP machine doesn’t turn off in the state of Alabama. Some states it does. In the state of Alabama, it does not. So you can still utilize your funds. We urge everybody to get on the app and set their card up and lock it so that their funds can’t be stolen if they have money on there,” she said.
Laura Lester, the director of Feeding Alabama, who works with food banks across the state including West Alabama Food Bank, said Friday while food banks began preparing at the beginning of the government shutdown, they alone cannot supply enough meals to families.
“For every one meal we provide, SNAP provides nine, right? That is a gap that cannot be filled, and we will do what we can with what we have for as long as we can,” Lester said. “But I can’t tell you what’s going to happen, or how long you know we’ll be able to help feeding the communities, because we’ve never, ever thought about or experienced anything like this before.”
Lester also said holiday food items are already being used by some food banks.
“One of our food banks explained that the food that she had ordered and had on stock for the holidays, she’s already had to pull that to hand out earlier than they had anticipated, and she’s simply hoping that they can backfill it,” she said.

Alabama Democrats call for state aid

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Alabama officials were aware that federal funding for SNAP would be reduced in fiscal year 2027, increasing the state’s share. According to estimates in August, the federal cuts to the program would increase DHR’s budget request by $35 million in FY27 and $208 million in FY28 when the state is responsible for 10% of SNAP benefits. 
The suspension of benefits for the 100% federally-funded program comes amid a month-long federal government shutdown, which is primarily a dispute over health care. Republicans in Congress lack the votes to overcome a budget filibuster. Democrats say they want a bipartisan agreement to extend subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans. Republicans said they won’t negotiate that until a stopgap spending bill is passed. 
Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin announced Thursday he would pull $1 million from the city’s reserve fund to help the 86,318 Jefferson County residents, about 13% of the county, who receive SNAP benefits. 
“Birmingham will not sit around and let our children and families starve. We are taking immediate action because we have a moral obligation to take care of the general welfare of our residents,” Woodfin said in a statement posted to Facebook. “We are launching an emergency food relief fund and a citywide food drive starting next week in partnership with United Way, Christian Service Ministries, and faith and community groups across all 99 neighborhoods.”
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is giving the state’s food banks a $4 million boost from its DHR budget. 
Alabama Democrats are calling on Gov. Kay Ivey to use state emergency fund to feed those losing assistance. Gina Maiola, communications director for Ivey’s office, did not directly respond to a question about the emergency fund. 
“Gov. Ivey remains hopeful U.S. Senate Democrats will come to their senses and do their job to reopen the federal government,” Maiola said.
Democrats in the Alabama Legislature are holding a press conference Monday morning at the State House, urging Ivey to call a special session to address funding for SNAP in the state. 
“We all recognize that this is a federal issue, but we cannot ignore its impact on Alabama where over 750,000 of our neighbors could go hungry,” Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro said in a statement. “The governor needs to call a special session so that we can deal with this crisis immediately and then we can use our rainy day funds to feed families until the federal government reaches a solution.”
About half of SNAP recipients in the state are children, according to DHR.
“No kid should go to bed hungry in Alabama simply because politicians in Washington can’t reach an agreement,” House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville said in a statement. “As legislators, we have a moral obligation to address this crisis and use state resources to bridge the gap.”
Maiola said Monday that funding SNAP is not the governor’s job.
“As Alabama DHR noted, SNAP benefits are 100% federally funded, and therefore, U.S. Food and Nutrition Services controls the issuance of these benefits on EBT cards. While the state does not have extra money to do Congress’ job, Governor Ivey hopes to see U.S. Senate Democrats get on board to reopen the federal government,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-11761149882.jpg,,,2025-10-31 17:02:32.120949
,DC,2025-10-31 20:13:04+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Effects of government shutdown spread on day 31, from health costs to food to flights","Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/effects-government-shutdown-spread-day-31-health-costs-food-flights,,"WASHINGTON — By Saturday, millions of Americans are expected to face a drastic spike in health care premium costs during open enrollment, though a hunger crisis may have been temporarily averted, both tied to the ongoing government shutdown.A federal judge in Massachusetts Friday afternoon found that the U.S. Department of Agriculture acted unlawfully in deciding to withhold billions in emergency funding for 42 million people who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, amid a government shutdown.But while the ruling does not order USDA to immediately tap into its roughly $6 billion contingency fund, a separate ruling from a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the agency to continue the payments after a coalition of religious and advocacy groups sued.Prior to both rulings, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins defended USDA’s decision to not use the contingency fund during a Friday press conference at the U.S. Capitol with House Speaker Mike Johnson on day 31 of the government shutdown. “We are here today because SNAP benefits run dry tomorrow, so the truth has finally revealed itself, hasn't it?” Rollins said. “Democrats’ support for programs like SNAP is now reduced to cynical control over people’s lives.”It was not yet clear midday Friday how the two court rulings would be carried out by the administration.The move to cut off SNAP would leave millions hungry, nearly 40% of them children, and is an effort by the Trump administration to put pressure on Senate Democrats to accept the House-passed GOP stopgap spending bill to fund the government until Nov. 21. Senate Democrats have held out demanding action on tax credits that will expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, hugely driving up costs. They have tried to spark negotiations, but Republicans have maintained that talks on health care subsidies will only begin after the government is funded. Flight delays, filibuster fate As the government shutdown continues, millions of federal workers are furloughed, or have continued to work without pay, including air traffic controllers. Flight delays and cancellations are starting to mount, with 3,739 delays within, into or out of the United States and 364 cancellations within the United States by midday Friday, according to the FlightAware delays tracker.Another shutdown complication emerged when President Donald Trump, who has spent most of the week abroad in Asia meeting with foreign leaders over trade and tariff talks, Thursday night urged Republicans to eliminate the Senate filibuster, which requires a 60-vote threshold. “Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote on his social media platform. Senate Republicans have been lukewarm on the idea, since Democrats then could do the same if they regain control of the chamber now held by the GOP with 53 seats.Lacking 60 votes, the Senate has failed 13 times to pass the House-passed stopgap spending measure and left Capitol Hill Thursday night. Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen from Nevada tried to keep the Senate in session, but was overruled by Republicans. Another critical deadline approaching Friday was pay for active duty military members. Vice President JD Vance said the Trump administration would shuffle funds to ensure pay, but did not detail those plans. According to Axios, the Defense Department pulled billions from several accounts to ensure the troops could be paid. Rollins defends USDA refusal to pay benefitsCongress failed to fund SNAP and nearly every other discretionary federal program for the 2026 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.In order to receive SNAP benefits, a household’s gross monthly income must be at or below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines. A family of four would receive a SNAP maximum monthly allotment of $994, according to USDA.Rollins sought to justify her agency’s refusal to shuffle the contingency funds to pay for SNAP, saying that money “is only allowed to flow if the underlying program is funded,” and “by law, a contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing.” The Agriculture secretary said that “even if it could flow, it doesn’t even cover half of the month of November.” USDA said in a memo earlier in October that it would not tap into the contingency fund to keep the program afloat in November, despite its since-deleted Sept. 30 shutdown plan saying it would tap into this reserve. The memo said the contingency fund “is a source of funds for contingencies, such as the Disaster SNAP program, which provides food purchasing benefits for individuals in disaster areas, including natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods, that can come on quickly and without notice.” Democrats have objected. Friday’s decision from a federal judge in Boston stems from a lawsuit brought by 25 states and the District of Columbia against the Trump administration to force USDA to use the contingency fund. USDA secretary recounts conversation with waiterAt the Capitol press conference, Rollins also recalled a recent encounter she had at a Louisiana restaurant with a “wonderful” waiter named Joe, who she said took on that job after being furloughed as a federal government employee due to the shutdown. “He didn't know who I was. And I said, 'Well, Joe, I can appreciate that. You know, I'm sort of in that world as well.' And I said, 'Where do you work?' And he said, 'Well, I work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in their New Orleans office as part of the financial team.'""Rollins said that encounter “just really brought home for me ... to echo what Mike (Johnson) said, just thanking so many thousands of federal workers who are showing up, who are still doing their job, who aren’t getting paid, those that are now concerned about putting food on the table and making their mortgages and paying their rent.” Rollins, along with the rest of the president's Cabinet, is still getting paid.Health premiums skyrocketAs open enrollment begins Saturday, those enrollees in the Affordable Care Act marketplace who currently receive a tax credit are likely to see their monthly premium payments more than double to about 114% on average, according to an analysis by KFF. For the last month, Democrats have warned of this, as the tax credits that help pay for individual health insurance are set to expire at the end of the year. The top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, said in a statement that many families will see an increase in their premiums on Nov. 1.“The sticker shock many families will face when they shop for health coverage is unacceptable, and it’s why Congress must act,” Pallone said.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that if Congress does not extend the tax credits, insurers expect healthy, younger people to drop their marketplace coverage plans, which will lead to increased premium costs. Anxiety over WIC programMeanwhile, USDA’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, a program separate from SNAP, got a $300 million infusion from the agency, using tariff revenue, to keep the program running through October. The program provides nearly 7 million women, infants and children with healthy foods, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and other resources. Advocates are calling on the administration to supply additional emergency funds for WIC. Led by the National WIC Association, more than three dozen national organizations signed on to an Oct. 24 letter to the White House urging the administration to provide an additional $300 million in emergency funding. Head Start affectedThe consequences of the shutdown are also hitting Head Start — a federal program that provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families and served more than 790,000 children in the 2023-2024 program year. The National Head Start Association estimates that 140 programs across 41 states and Puerto Rico serving more than 65,000 children will not receive their operational funding if the shutdown continues past Nov. 1 — a reality that appears certain.Six of those programs serving more than 6,500 children did not receive this funding on Oct. 1 and have had to look to outside resources and local funds to keep their programs afloat. SNAP, WIC and Native communities American Indian and Alaska Native communities are also scrambling to fill the anticipated gaps in food security and assistance due to funding uncertainties for SNAP and WIC. Advocates and U.S. senators across the aisle say these funding uncertainties for the key federal nutrition programs are putting particular pressure on Native communities. At an Oct. 29 Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing on the shutdown’s impacts on tribal communities, Minnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said she is hearing from tribal nations in her state about people switching from SNAP to the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, or FDPIR, a separate USDA initiative.FDPIR is an alternative to SNAP and, per USDA, provides foods “to income-eligible households living on Indian reservations, and to American Indian households residing in approved areas near reservations and in Oklahoma.”",,,,2025-10-31 16:17:03.636531

(Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General Motors)General Motors is set to lay off 3,400 workers at facilities building electric vehicles, including more than a thousand employees at a plant in Detroit, according to a report from the Detroit News on Wednesday.
While GM, one of the Detroit Three automakers, did not respond to a request for comment, the News reported that 1,200 workers at the Factory Zero Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center would be left without a job, with cuts based on seniority.
Jesse Lee, senior advisor for Climate Power, a strategic communications organization focused on promoting progress on climate issues, laid the blame at President Donald Trump’s feet, with his administration working to eliminate federal support for electric vehicles.
“Trump’s full-scale assault on clean energy manufacturing is serving Americans with pink slips and skyrocketing energy bills, while giving China a competitive edge in the automotive industry,” Lee said, arguing that Republicans will answer for their support of Trump’s anti-electric vehicle policies in the 2026 midterm election.
Earlier this month, GM canceled plans for a $55 million hydrogen fuel cell factory in Detroit, which was set to create 140 new jobs. Crain’s Detroit Business reported that the decision was based on a lack of hydrogen infrastructure and longer-than-expected transition to electric vehicles, alongside the Department of Energy’s plans to eliminate funding awards supporting 223 unspecified projects.

(Photo courtesy of West Virginia Department of Health)Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s $60 million sale of West Virginia’s four long-term nursing homes closes Friday, placing the facilities under private ownership after many lawmakers for years have said no to the change.
The hospitals, which mostly serve elderly patients using Medicaid, were operating at $6 million annual financial loss to the state. 
The buyers, New York-based developer Marx Development Group and its subsidiary, Majestic Care, are contractually required to build at least three new hospitals on a set timeline, according to documents obtained through a public records request. The four hospitals need $3.9 million in deferred maintenance. 
Majestic Care could potentially build the new hospitals in undetermined locations because it isn’t required to rebuild at the current hospital sites. 
In Beckley, local officials still have many questions and concerns about the future of FRMS Health Systems that operates on the same property as Jackie Withrow Hospital, which is being sold. 
“FMRS is on the same tract of land, and I guess nobody even considered that when they decided they wanted to sell this thing to somebody,” said Raleigh County Commissioner Daniel Hall. “FMRS provides tons of valuable services through Raleigh County and three other counties. We just can’t allow this to just go away.”
FMRS offers adult and children’s behavioral health services, including outpatient psychiatric services. It’s one of the state’s 13 comprehensive behavioral health centers and includes crisis stabilization that helps people get stabilized to prevent them from being hospitalized. 
“We keep a lot of people out of the hospital and keep them functioning in the community,” said Randy Venable, chief executive officer at FMRS.
With the sale being finalized, Venable said it was unclear what would happen in the future.
“To have to relocate with short notice, it would be very difficult for sure, because I don’t know of an existing building that we could move into in short notice,” he said. “Of course, the financial strain would be pretty significant as well.”
“You don’t really know what’s going to happen with a private entity,” he added.
Majestic Care did not respond to an email with questions for this story. 
The Raleigh County Commission sent a letter to the governor earlier this month asking that the FMRS facilities be carved out from the sale of Jackie Withrow, but the sale wasn’t changed.
Del. Carl “Bill” Roop, R-Raleigh
“What I had proposed to the governor’s office is there’s 9.2 acres, what I call below the road that separated from the Jackie Withrow hospital, then that could easily be cut out of this sale,” said Raleigh County Attorney Bill Roop, who also serves in the state House of Delegates.
The state’s contract with MDG requires the company to assume the lease agreement between FMRS two years with the possibility to renew. If they terminate it, the company would have six months to relocate, according to Venable. 
“If two years from now they decide to use this property for something else, we’ve been given a six month period to try to figure out how to relocate, which would be probably next to impossible,” he said.
Jackie Withrow hospital also contains incarcerated individuals with the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The state’s jails are overcrowded, and DCR would have to absorb the inmates should Majestic Care decide that it no longer wants to operate a floor for corrections. 
Hall said Raleigh County officials spoke with the governor’s office over the issue ahead of the sale closing date. 
“They’ve listened to what we’ve told them … but, there’s been no response really, no direction of what’s going to happen,” he said.
Morrisey didn’t return a request for comment about communication issues surrounding the sale of Jackie Withrow.
“I think it’s very important that everybody knows what’s going to happen — FRMS and [corrections], because this is not something that we can just pack our bags and move out tomorrow,” Roop said. “I think the sooner that we have a permanent plan, the better. I mean longer than two years.”
Sen. Rollan Roberts, R-Raleigh
Sen. Rollan Roberts, R-Raleigh, also hoped that there’d soon be a long-term plan for FMRS.
“With COVID and the challenges of society these days, I think, more than than ever, we need to have these kinds of facilities available so that we can help people with their mental health issues,” he said. 
Earlier this week, a judge ruled that Morrisey and Department of Health Facilities Secretary Michael Caruso had legal authority to sell the long-term care hospitals without the Legislature’s approval based on a 2023 bill that created the facilites department. 
During the hearing, lawyers representing Morrisey said around 90% of employees are staying on to work with Majestic Care. Additionally, the company has committed to keeping current patients. 
Morrisey told reporters that the sale “is a better deal for all the people that are getting care of those facilities.” “I’m excited about that,” he added.

The beginning of open enrollment comes as the federal government shutdown continues amid disagreements in Congress about the future of federal subsidies for these health insurance policies, which are available under the Affordable Care Act. 
These tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year without an extension from Congress. Democrats have refused to vote to end the shutdown without Republicans agreeing to extend the subsidies. 
Premiums for individual insurance bought on the Washington Health Benefit Exchange are rising an average of 21%, due in part to the loss of these enhanced tax credits, which started during the COVID pandemic. This increase is in line with similar hikes nationwide. The average growth rate last year was 10.7% in Washington.
The state Office of the Insurance Commissioner estimates the increase this year would be 6% or 7% less if the tax credits continued.
Though at this point, it’s unclear how ​​Congress deciding to extend the tax credits would affect premiums now that open enrollment is beginning. 
The Washington exchange’s CEO, Ingrid Ulrey, said last week that if Congress takes action, “we are committed to delivering that relief to our customers as quickly as possible.” 
Nearly 300,000 Washington residents buy insurance on the exchange. About three-quarters of them qualified for the federal tax credits, helping them decrease annual premiums by an average of $1,330. For seniors, those savings jump to more than $1,900 annually.
The exchange is used by people who do not have access to health insurance through their jobs or from government programs, like Medicaid. 
In some parts of Washington, enrollees who benefit from the tax credits could see their premiums double without them. The hardest-hit spots are in rural areas of eastern Washington, according to a report from U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.
State officials expect 80,000 people to now forgo health insurance if the credits aren’t extended. Washington’s uninsured rate has been improving for years, to 4.8% in 2023. Officials worry the end of the subsidies will cause the state to backslide on that progress.
“That means higher costs and strains on our health care system as people put off preventative care,” state Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer said Thursday. “These effects will be felt by people across the state, but will hurt some of our rural communities the hardest.”
Those who choose to go without insurance are more likely to be healthy, likely fueling further premium hikes for those who remain insured, as the insurance pool would be less healthy overall and more risky for insurers.
The state still offers options for financial help, including Cascade Care Savings for people who make up to 250% of the federal poverty line. The premium assistance program, launched in 2023, helps nearly 100,000 residents.
Washington’s exchange is seeking $130 million per year in state funding for Cascade Care Savings to mitigate the loss of the federal tax credits. This would require legislative approval.
Open enrollment will run through Jan. 15. To begin coverage by Jan. 1, enrollees should sign up by Dec. 15. Those who apply later will have their plans begin Feb. 1. Existing customers will be automatically renewed, but can still shop around and compare plans.

(Getty Images)Louisiana intends to step in for the federal government in November and provide food aid for most of the state’s needy. But those benefits will trickle out in weekly installments instead of all at once.
Plus, the federal government shutdown that will halt Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments starting Saturday has also led the state to furlough 786 employees who help distribute benefits, the Louisiana Department of Health announced Friday. They have been told not to report to work Monday. Another 298 LDH workers in its SNAP section are considered “essential” and will remain on the job. 
The elderly, disabled and children are typically first in line to have SNAP funds loaded on their electronic benefits transfer cards at the start of the month. Everyone else who qualifies for assistance then receives their assistant in numerical order based on their Social Security number. 
Starting Saturday, Louisiana will issue SNAP recipients 25% of their typical monthly benefits. An additional 25% will be loaded onto their EBT cards each week as long as the government shutdown continues.
Average monthly SNAP payments for an individual in Louisiana are just short of $400. A family of four receives around $950, with income and other factors impacting the amount.
Louisiana is poised to handle food aid for some 793,000 SNAP recipients as federal courts weigh in on lawsuits from Democratic state and city leaders and nonprofit groups against the Trump administration for withholding the benefits. 
In Boston, a judge ruled Friday the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to pause SNAP payments is illegal, but she gave the government until Monday to respond to her findings before she orders payments to be issued. A Rhode Island judge in a similar case has issued a temporary restraining order that requires the USDA to dole out SNAP starting Saturday.          
In an emergency declaration last week, Gov. Jeff Landry has directed the state health department to redirect $147 million of its resources to cover SNAP benefits for November. He said this week the benefits will be made available to the elderly, disabled and children from qualifying families, who together total about 793,000 recipients. Another 53,000 SNAP recipients, who the governor described as “able-bodied,” will not receive assistance and are being directed to food banks to meet their needs. 
Landry also encouraged those who won’t get SNAP benefits in November to apply for jobs, though his administration has not said how many people within the group of 53,000 are already working but still rely on food aid.    
Should the government shutdown last beyond November, Landry said he would draw from a state reserve revenue account to continue providing food benefits.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) speaks at a ""Yes to Wind"" news conference in Baltimore on Oct. 31, 2025. Van Hollen joined a group of elected officials and advocates backing Maryland's offshore wind project, which already has all of its federal permits, amid attacks by the Trump administration.Advocates and lawmakers gathered in Baltimore on Friday to punch back at President Donald Trump’s assault on offshore wind projects, including one planned for Maryland’s coast.
Until Friday, the battle had largely played out in warring court documents traded between the Trump administration and US Wind, the company behind the proposal for up to 121 turbines off the coast of Ocean City.
In September, Trump’s Department of the Interior told a federal judge that it plans to revoke a critical federal permit issued to the US Wind project in the dying days of President Joe Biden’s administration.
The permit had been challenged by the Town of Ocean City, which welcomed the permit reversal. But the judge is still considering the government’s request, which has been ardently opposed by US Wind.
The event in Baltimore was the first of several “Yes to Wind” events planned for states across the country, and attracted two Maryland Democrats: U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Rep. Johnny Olszewski.

“What you’re seeing here is people power. Because what you’re seeing from President Trump in the White House right now is a tip of the hat to the Big Oil guys,” Van Hollen said. “They don’t like the competition.”
Earlier this year, a coalition of Maryland climate groups, labor unions and renewable energy advocates joined to form the Offshore Wind Alliance. They’ve squared up against the Stop Offshore Wind coalition, sponsored by the Town of Ocean City, Worcester County and business groups from the beach town.
But not everyone on Maryland’s Eastern Shore opposes the project, said Jared Schablein, chairman of the civic organization Shore Progress.
“This project injects new life into our local workforce by bringing real jobs, real investment and real hope into my community,” Schablein said. “It’s about making sure the next generation of shore kids don’t have to move away to find opportunities.”
Much of the messaging on Friday was focused on the economics behind the wind project, with supporters arguing that the project will lower utility bills by bolstering power supply.
“Offshore wind means lower utility bills. Let me say it again: Offshore wind means lower utility bills,” Olszewski said. “Blocking these projects will not lower costs, it will raise them.”
The project’s opponents have argued that, in addition to hurting Ocean City tourism and coastal fisheries, the project will raise power bills, partly because of construction costs.
Paul Pinsky, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, said it’s possible that the wind farm could cause a “blip” for ratepayers, but urged Marylanders to take a long-term view of the project’s economics.
“With many of these energy projects, whether it’s rooftop solar or offshore wind, there’s an upfront cost, but it can get recovered fairly quickly, and once it’s recovered, the price drops considerably,” Pinsky said.
A January study from the Energy Administration indicated that Maryland is “below trajectory to meet its existing clean energy targets, in particular those renewable targets set for 2030.” The state has an overall goal of reaching 100% carbon-free energy by 2035.
The Trump administration began by halting the issuance of any new offshore wind leases off the coast of the United States. But the administration has since begun targeting projects that already received federal approval — and in some cases, had already started construction, unlike Maryland’s project.
The Trump administration has issued “stop work” orders to Empire Wind in New York (which was rescinded after negotiations with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul) and to Revolution Wind in Rhode Island (which was overturned by a federal judge).
In Maryland, the administration requested to revoke the project’s approval, citing a need to review impacts on coastal fisheries and search-and-rescue efforts in the area.
“It wasn’t enough to raise taxes on clean energy. It wasn’t enough for them to stop offshore wind leases,” said Maryland Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery). “They had to actually do stop work orders on projects that were 80% complete, because that’s how much their billionaire fossil fuel buddies are threatened by offshore wind.”

The administration also rescinded $679 million in grant funding for port projects in the U.S., including some tied to offshore wind manufacturing. That included $47.4 million bound for the Sparrows Point Steel turbine manufacturing hub planned for Baltimore County.
“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a news release at the time.
“This is an administration that has explicitly gone after clean energy projects in Democratic-led states and Democratic-led districts,” Olszewski said. “That is not who we are as Americans. We are better than that.”
Friday’s news conference was held at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 24 office in Baltimore, which also includes a training center for future electricians.
The center trains about 600 apprentices each year, said Rico Albacarys, political director for the union. In high-voltage training courses taught toward the end of apprentices’ four years of study, the students work on the types of thick cables that run through wind turbines, Albacarys said.
To work on building Maryland’s first offshore wind farm, though, electricians will need a special certification that isn’t offered at the center on Patapsco Avenue in West Baltimore.
Called global wind organization training, the certification costs about $2,000 per person, and it only lasts for two years, Albacarys said. So the Trump administration’s efforts to slow the US Wind project have made it more difficult for the union to plan when it will train its members, Albacarys said.
“We’re trying to thread the needle,” Albacarys said. “We don’t want to start training them too early [so] that they have to get recertified before they actually are able to work on the turbines.”
Regardless of the recent obstacles, Albacarys said he’s confident that Maryland will eventually gain a wind farm on its Atlantic coast.
“It’s only a matter of time,” Albacarys said. “I know it doesn’t feel that way right now, but I think 20 years from now, we’re looking back at: ‘Oh, remember that speed bump?’”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)State officials on Friday delivered a Halloween treat for Rhode Island: The potential that Bryant University may serve as a base camp for one of the national soccer teams competing in the 2026 World Cup.
Tournament hosts FIFA on Oct. 1 added the private university in Smithfield to its list of potential base camps when the quadrennial tournament comes to North America next summer — the only location in New England to make the global soccer organization’s brochure.
The region already has a confirmed role in tournament play, with seven matches scheduled from June 13 to July 9 at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, which is roughly 30 miles from Bryant.
“I see this as a great opportunity for Rhode Island,” Gov. Dan McKee told reporters and officials gathered inside Bryant’s new 43,000-square-foot field house. “When we build things, excitement comes.”
Which team could call Bryant its temporary home will be made clear over the winter after FIFA’s World Cup draw at The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 5. The draw will divide 48 teams into 12 groups of four. FIFA will then release a schedule of which teams will play at Gillette.
McKee and Bryant officials are certain FIFA will keep Rhode Island in the mix because of the $40 million field house that opened in August. 
Bill Smith, vice president of athletics and recreation for the university, highlighted the building’s glass-enclosed treatment rooms, classroom-sized film room, ample locker space, and easy access from the second-floor press box to Bryant’s grass soccer fields.
“I promise that whatever national team is fortunate enough to select us as their team base camp, we are going to bring that same energy and commitment to excellence as them as well,” Smith said.
McKee pointed to the university’s history as the New England Patriots’ training camp site from the late 1970s to 2002 and as the first home of Rhode Island FC before the state’s only professional team moved to Centreville Bank Stadium in Pawtucket.
“We know that Bryant can get it done,” McKee said.

A team’s commitment does not have to be made until February, former Rhode Island Commerce Secretary Liz Tanner told Rhode Island Current after the press conference.
Tanner is heading Ocean State 2026, a nonprofit formed by the state in June to lead business sponsorship efforts on tournament-related activities in Rhode Island. State officials predict the Massachusetts matches will generate more than $330 million in local economic impact. Ocean State 2026 does not yet appear to have an active website.
But there’s a possibility the games won’t come to Gillette. 
President Donald Trump on Oct. 15 threatened to move World Cup matches out of the Boston area over what he called “street takeovers” in the city. FIFA has acknowledged that the U.S. federal government does ultimately have the final say on World Cup host cities.
Tanner said that despite those threats, the state’s World Cup nonprofit is continuing with the assumption that matches will continue in Foxboro.
“Contracts have been signed, commitments have been made,” she told Rhode Island Current.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley is already pitching the capital as a destination for visiting fans and athletes, with plans for citywide viewing parties and celebrations during the tournament.
“The hospitality that visitors will experience in our capital city, and really throughout Rhode Island, will be second to none,” he said. “They will know and experience our incredible restaurants, our amazing hoteliers, the arts and culture that define us as a city and a region.” 
“This is our moment to shine,” General Treasurer James Diossa, who also serves as chairman of Ocean State 2026, said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-31 19:55:14+00:00,Mississippi Today,Gov. Tate Reeves seeks ban on sugary food and drinks paid for with SNAP benefits,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/31/reeves-snap-benefits-sugar/,"Mississippi will seek a waiver that would restrict the use of food assistance benefits to purchase sugary food and drinks, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves announced Friday.","Mississippi will seek a waiver that would restrict the use of food assistance benefits to purchase sugary food and drinks, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves announced Friday. 
The announcement comes as thousands of Mississippi families face the loss of Supplemental Food Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits beginning Saturday as a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown.
In addition, purchasing hot prepared chicken with SNAP benefits would be allowed if the federal government accepts the state’s waiver application. If approved, the changes will take effect in January 2027. 
“In a nation that is printing money daily just to make our debt payments, it doesn’t make sense to throw your tax money at anything other than the true necessities,” Reeves said in a statement. 
“So it makes no sense at all to fund sugar instead of hearty nutritious meals. That’s why we’re amending our food stamp rules to allow good sustaining food like rotisserie chickens and disallow sugary candy and drinks.”
Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration Friday to use emergency funds to continue SNAP payments. It was not clear how quickly people would be able to access their benefits, a process that can take one to two weeks, according to the Associated Press.
The Mississippi Department of Human Services said it could not yet comment on how the ruling will impact distribution of SNAP benefits in the state for November.

Food assistance has continued to flow in past shutdowns, but the federal government has said it cannot use emergency funds to pay for the program during the ongoing shutdown. 
Reeves has not indicated he will move for Mississippi to bridge the gap in the food assistance program until the federal shutdown ends. Democratic and Republican governors in a handful of other states, including Louisiana, have pledged to use state funds to cover all or part of the program.
Dr. Patricia Tibbs, the president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said she shares Reeves’ goal of promoting healthy eating, but believes that state leaders must first address the loss of benefits that will begin Saturday. 
“While efforts to encourage healthier food choices are commendable, restricting options without ensuring consistent access to food first risks worsening hunger in already vulnerable homes,” she said in a written statement to Mississippi Today. 
“It is difficult to talk about ‘healthy choices’ when families face empty refrigerators.” 
Twelve other states, overwhelmingly led by Republican governors, have been approved this year for waivers that ban the purchase of sugary foods and drinks by the United States Department of Agriculture, which oversees the food assistance program. The approved changes will take effect next year. 
Some states have been approved for or requested waivers that allow for the purchase of hot chicken. SNAP benefits can not currently be used to buy any foods that are hot at the point of sale.
Mississippi’s waiver asks the federal government to approve the following changes to SNAP: 

Banning purchases of processed foods that list sugar, cane sugar, corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup as the first two ingredients. The restrictions do not include foods with granulated sugar, raw sugar, and other single-ingredient sugars used for cooking and baking listed as the first two ingredients.
Banning purchases of beverages that list carbonated water and sugar, cane sugar, corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup as the first two ingredients. Drinks that list aspartame or other low- or noncaloric sweeteners as the first two ingredients will remain eligible.
Making hot prepared chicken eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits, including items like rotisserie and non-fried, non-breaded chicken. The state also plans to collaborate with the Double Up Food Bucks Program to encourage people to buy fresh fruits and vegetables with purchases of hot prepared chicken.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pushed for the changes as a part of his “make America healthy again” agenda and encouraged states to apply for waivers. 
“For years, SNAP has used taxpayer dollars to fund soda and candy — products that fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics,” he said in a statement on Aug. 4. 
About 1 in 8 Mississippians — or about 400,000 people — receive food assistance through SNAP. Two thirds of participants are in families with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. 
An August report from state Auditor Shad White found that Mississippi taxpayers would save $22 million annually and improve the health of its citizens by restricting the purchase of certain junk foods with SNAP benefits.
“President Trump is focused on making America healthy again, so we need to make Mississippi healthy again,” said White in a statement. 
“That means a renewed commitment to exercise and teaching our children healthy habits, but it also means using a little more common sense in how we spend taxpayer money on food stamps.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05132428/3X0A8974.jpg,,,2025-10-31 16:01:31.338899

Oct. 30, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s projected budget hole just widened to approximately $451 million following new economic forecasts.
Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board met Friday to update state revenue projections for the current two-year budget cycle. Members lowered their previous tax revenue projections from April by about $367 million over the two years.
The current projected deficit listed in Nebraska’s general fund financial status stands at about $95 million, which would bring the new deficit up to about $462 million if the tally were added straight from Friday’s meeting.
However, Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said several other factors contributing to state finances mean the projected deficit is expected to rise about $355 million, to reach an estimated $451 million gap.
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of Elkhorn, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, said he expected the deficit would grow prior to Friday’s forecast, based on various signs. The state’s monthly tax receipts have been a mixed bag, and the Nebraska Department of Revenue released a report in September estimating that the “One Big Beautiful Bill” would cost Nebraska’s state government about $216 million over the next two fiscal years.

“We can kind of do the math before we get here,” Von Gillern said after the meeting.
Gov. Jim Pillen, in a statement, acknowledged the lower receipts and said he had anticipated the need for belt-tightening, which is why he said he seeks “critical” work to trim $500 million a year from the budget over the next two years.
“It’s a big number, but it’s necessary as we work to fix the broken property tax system, end special interest carve outs and exemptions and balance our budget,” Pillen said.
In addition to the monthly tax receipts reported on the state Department of Revenue’s website, the forecasting board also got preliminary estimates for October’s receipts. Patent said October revenues are expected to be between $22-$40 million above forecasts.

While the increase in the projected deficit is significant, several board members said they were feeling more optimistic about Nebraska’s economic future than what the current signs indicate.
Some members said the recent decline in revenues are more linked to structural policy decisions than an economic slowdown, a read with which Von Gillern agreed.
“When you cut through the noise, things are actually, from my perspective, really stable and quite optimistic for the state as a whole,” said board member John Kuehn.
Patent and other state officials have noted that some declining revenues that have recently been reported is more due to the timing of when revenue is reported. Larger-than-expected claims of ImagiNE Act tax credits — an economic incentive program for businesses expanding in or relocating to Nebraska — contributed to lower corporate revenues in September, for example.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee, previously told the Examiner that the program was expected to dole out about $36 million in credits over 12 months, but instead it distributed roughly $22 million over the past three months.
Von Gillern said the ImagiNE Act credits are also expected to raise sales tax refunds in the coming months. Sales tax revenues were the only category that rose at all from the forecasting board’s April projections. The board’s sales tax estimates rose by $60 million for fiscal year 2025-26, but dropped $123 million for fiscal year 2026-27.
Regardless of the new forecast, Von Gillern said state lawmakers’ job remains the same when the next session convenes in January — balance the state budget by the time they adjourn in mid-April.
Lawmakers will have updated numbers while they are debating budget adjustments. Patent said the state’s Tax Rate Review Committee meets in November, which will update the exact projected deficit in Nebraska’s financial status. The forecasting board also meets once more, on Feb. 27.

(Photo by Galina Zhigalova/Getty image)Amid uncertainty over the availability of federal funding for food benefits for new moms and young children, Rhode Island is the latest state to tap into its own coffers to keep the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program afloat.
Gov. Dan McKee announced Friday that $600,000 in state funds will be used to ensure the benefit program, typically funded by federal dollars, remains available through November despite the government shutdown.  
“WIC provides essential nutrition and support for women, infants, and children across our state,” McKee said. “Whether it’s standing up for Rhode Islanders being cut off from SNAP by President Trump or protecting families who depend on WIC, Rhode Island will not stand by and do nothing while this crisis hurts the people we serve.” 
The program provides food, education and other resources to nearly 7 million at-risk pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding individuals nationwide — and 18,000 in Rhode Island —-  nationwide, as well as infants and children up to 5 years old. 
As a discretionary program, WIC is subject to congressional approval each year — making it particularly vulnerable to the ongoing funding lapse. A $300 million federal infusion, including tariff revenue, kept the program afloat through October. And as the shutdown extends into a second month, there are growing concerns that the initial appropriation will run dry.
Similar fears surrounded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps a broader swath of low-income and vulnerable residents afford groceries. On Friday, a pair of federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island separately ordered the Trump administration to tap government contingency funds to keep the food assistance program afloat, though compliance remains unclear. The court orders do not apply to WIC, leaving states scrambling to cover the gap.
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Friday afternoon regarding the source of state funds. 
The initial state injection is expected to fund benefits for pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children through the end of November, according to McKee’s office.
If the shutdown continues past Nov. 30, the governor’s office said it will assess the situation.
Community nonprofits that serve as providers where applicants can sign up for the state program praised McKee’s decision in a series of statements Friday afternoon.
 “This program is a vital resource to families, and disruptions in their ability to receive benefits impacts their overall health and well-being,” said Alison Croke, president and CEO of Wood River Health, noting that the medical clinic is the only provider for WIC in Washington County.
Without the contingency funding, 1,400 infants and children who receive food assistance through Meeting Street’s early childhood programs would go hungry, John Kelly, Meeting Street president, said. 
“I am proud to live and work in a state that shares Meeting Street’s values of compassion, respect and inclusivity, by demonstrating — through its actions — that all children in our community have a right to basic nutrition,” Kelly said.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Human Services expects to furlough up to 1,534 employees and temporarily close its local offices within the next week and a half if the federal government does not reopen, the agency announced in a Friday news release.
The government shutdown that began Oct. 1 remained unresolved this week after Congress failed to pass a proposed deal to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 
If DHS cannot administer SNAP by Nov. 1, the agency will furlough 34 employees, “and multiple programs that receive federal funding through grants administered by DHS will have to cease those services,” according to the news release.

Food assistance funding cliff approaching as shutdown persists


Those programs include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), and Community Service Block Grant (CSBG) initiatives.
The 34 employees set for immediate furlough are in DHS’ Office of Payment Integrity; Division of Aging, Adult, and Behavioral Health Services; and Division of County Operations.
DHS furloughed 37 employees in the Division of Provider Services and Quality Assurance on Oct. 1, and they remain furloughed, the news release states.
If the shutdown continues through Nov. 7, DHS will temporarily close its offices in all 75 Arkansas counties and furlough 1,500 Division of County Operations employees starting Nov. 10. All of those positions and operations are federally funded.
“The government shutdown has put enormous strain on many services we offer, and we are deeply concerned that important benefits Arkansans rely on will suffer as a result,” DHS Secretary Janet Mann said in the news release. “First and foremost, this will be painful for the beneficiaries we serve, and we regret that we have been placed in this position. It will also be painful for the hundreds of employees within our agency who will not be paid for as long as this shutdown continues.”
SNAP benefits will cease on Nov. 1 without federal action, but DHS’ electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system will still be operational in November in case SNAP recipients have some previous benefits saved, according to the news release.
More than 222,000 individuals and over 118,000 households received SNAP benefits as of Sept. 1, according to another DHS news release.
To alleviate the impact on families losing food assistance, Arkansas will distribute $500,000 among six regional food bank networks, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Friday morning.
Six Arkansas Head Start locations to close Nov. 1 due to funding loss from government shutdown

The government shutdown’s impact on Arkansas government services has not been limited to DHS.
The Pulaski County locations of Arkansas’ federally-funded early childhood education program, Head Start, will temporarily close Saturday due to a lack of funding, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences announced last week. The six facilities in Little Rock and North Little Rock serve 446 children from low-income families, and 130 employees will be furloughed.
Another impact of the shutdown on child care is the Department of Education’s lack of access to funds supporting the School Readiness Assistance Program, which helps low-income families access child care. The program was already financially insolvent and had a waitlist of over 1,100, department officials said in September. That waitlist has grown to 1,569, according to the program’s website.
An emergency working group of child care experts proposed a months-long financial solution that the department will decide Friday whether to accept.
The Arkansas Department of Health will continue administering Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) benefits until mid-November if the shutdown does not end by then, department officials said last week.
The eventual reopening of the federal government is expected to cause delays in processing SNAP cases, according to Friday’s DHS news release.
Medicaid benefits will continue uninterrupted because the program is federally funded through the end of the calendar year.

In Washington, Democrats and national advocates are warning about the growing consequences that the government shutdown will have on Head Start programs across the country.
On Saturday, another wave of funding lapses is set to affect nearly 60,000 more children across 41 states, according to the National Head Start Association.
In Vermont, none of the state’s seven Head Start programs will need to shutter in November, according to Christy Swenson, the Head Start Director at Capstone Community Action and board chair of the Vermont Head Start Association. 
However, several will face temporary closure in early December if the shutdown wears on, Swenson said. Leaders of programs serving two Vermont regions — the Champlain Valley and the Northeast Kingdom — anticipate running out of federal funds by then, they said. 
The federal Head Start program, which provides child care and nutritious meals to more than 700,000 children across the country, and around 1,250 in Vermont, has already faced funding lapses that forced some locations in other states to close completely and others to look for interim funding elsewhere. 
Head Start, together with Early Head Start, aims to serve children from birth to age 5 living in foster care or households with incomes below the federal poverty line, or who are experiencing homelessness. In Vermont, almost one-fifth of children enrolled are unhoused or experiencing housing insecurity, according to an analysis of federal data by a national advocacy group.
“It’s an absolute tragedy,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who caucuses with Democrats, said about the upcoming lapses. “And it is beyond comprehension that you have a Republican House, which is now in its fifth week of vacation. Maybe they want to come to work and help us resolve this crisis.”
Head Start is funded on annual cycles, which have starting dates that vary from program to program, Swenson said. Once the commitment is renewed, the process of “drawing down” federal funding as it becomes necessary is not affected by the shutdown, she added.
Champlain Valley Head Start in Burlington is only guaranteed funding through Nov. 1, which means their grant ends on Saturday, Sandra Graves, the program’s director, said on Friday. Her program would be able to stay open through November under a continued shutdown, although only by exhausting its financial reserves, she said.
The program, which is operated by the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, serves Chittenden, Addison, Franklin, and Grand Isle counties. Graves’ staff of 63 provides care and programs to 233 enrolled children and their families, she said.
On Dec. 5, in the absence of federal funding or other support, all of the program’s offerings will need to pause, and all staff will be furloughed, Graves said. The annual grant from the federal Office of Head Start is roughly $7.2 million, she said, which represents the program’s entire operating budget save two small state-level grants.
The Head Start program run by Northeast Kingdom Community Action, or NEKCA, has a Dec. 1 funding cycle, but does not possess the financial cushion that Champlain Valley has available, said NEKCA Executive Director Jenna O’Farrell. The program may be able to keep running for a short time after Dec. 1 with a fraction of its previous capacity, but O’Farrell said that isn’t guaranteed.
That program operates eight physical locations across the rural Northeast Kingdom. It serves 160 children and their families, and employs 78 staff members.
Champlain Valley Head Start filed its annual federal funding application on time in August, Graves said. Ordinarily, the request should have been approved in September. But the Office of Head Start has seen cuts to staffing under the Trump administration, and every aspect of Graves’ interaction with federal officials has slowed, she said.
Even once the government opens, Graves has been told her organization’s funding approval might take several weeks. It may be hard to avoid the Dec. 5 deadline even if the shutdown ends in mid-November, she said.
Graves has not heard from the federal Office of Head Start since the shutdown began. Even though reimbursement for stopgap measures would be customary, she said recent federal actions toward other service programs have made her nervous.
The program’s closure would be a “huge, huge loss for our children and families,” Graves said. Apart from being a source of food and services for kids, Champlain Valley Head Start provides child care that allows parents to stay in the workforce, Graves added.
Graves has applied for temporary state funding from the Vermont Emergency Board, which on Wednesday approved a state-funded stopgap for lost federal food assistance. Champlain Valley Head Start will need about $1 million to remain stable over the next two months, Graves said.
O’Farrell said she too plans to apply for funding from the state’s Emergency Board. NEKCA’s Head Start program’s monthly expenses total roughly $450,000.
A closure would cause an “immediate, severe impact on low-income families across our service area,” O’Farrell said. 
Federal finger pointing
Outside of Congress, pressure from nonprofit groups is starting to pick up as Head Start programs look for solutions elsewhere.
“They are working with their states, working with their counties, working with their school districts, looking within their agencies, talking to philanthropic partners, just really trying to do everything that they can to avoid children and families being the collateral damage of the political fights in Washington,” said Tommy Sheridan, the deputy director of the National Head Start Association, a nonprofit that represents Head Start organizations and programs in Washington, D.C.
“They’re not gonna be able to hold that back forever,” Sheridan added.
Across the country, some Head Start programs already lost funding on Oct. 1 when their fiscal year ended, but the Saturday Nov. 1 deadline will have an even bigger effect because programs in the vast majority of states will lose their federal funding.
More than 100 organizations signed a letter released Tuesday, led by the First Five Years Fund, a nonprofit that supports child care and early education programs. In it, they asked Congress to end the shutdown.
“We cannot allow political gridlock to take away opportunities from our youngest learners and their families,” the letter reads.
But the pressure appears to have little effect on Republicans on Capitol Hill, even though lawmakers are aware that programs in their states could close. The Florida Head Start Association wrote in a press release that seven grantees won’t get a federal check on Saturday, bringing the total number of affected children in the state to almost 9,000.
“Isn’t it awful that the Democrats are doing this?” Sen. Ashley Moody, R-Fla., told NOTUS. Her comment is in line with Republicans’ messaging strategy of placing blame on Democrats for the shutdown as they withhold votes due to expiring health care subsidies.
In a statement to NOTUS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also tried to place the blame on Democrats.
“More than 58,000 children are on course to lose access to Head Start funding and programs on November 1 due solely to the Democrat-led government shutdown,” a spokesperson for the federal department said in a statement to NOTUS.
Despite the fact that many programs for low-income families are barrelling toward losing federal funding, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and WIC, senators seem no closer to ending the shutdown stalemate.
The home state of Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., would be one of the most affected by Head Start funding lapses. 
When asked what people in Florida are saying about losing programs that help low-income families, Scott said, “They’re fed up with the Democrats shutting down the government.”

Coming the day before federal nutrition support is set to be suspended on Saturday, Horhn said the city is pledging $150,000 for meals and targeted food assistance throughout the metro area. The funding will chiefly support two nonprofits – the Community Foundation of Mississippi and supper meals provided by Jackson Public Schools.
“When neighbors are in need, we rally,” he said. 
The mayor also called on Jacksonians with the means to donate nonperishable goods and money to these efforts, noting he had already pledged $1,000 of his own money. The city funds will come from a suspended program, he said. 
“Let’s make sure no one faces an empty refrigerator or dining table,” he said. 
Fire stations throughout the city will accept donations of nonperishable goods. The National Folk Festival, set for Nov. 7-9, will also have a donation box next to the guest services booth. 
City leaders said food pantries in the metro area need volunteers. 
“One of the things that will constrain us most is if we don’t have the staff and the manpower to meet the needs,” said Jill Buckley, the executive director of Stewpot Community Services. 
In an example of the coordinated effort, Karla McCullough, executive director of the Juanita Sims Doty Foundation, said the nonprofit has over 250 volunteers who can help the pantries process food donations. She also thanked Horhn for his leadership. 
“Youth and community, those are our north stars,” she said. “So wherever they go, whatever they need, this is where we go and we provide what we can to fill the need.” 
In a press release, JPS said it was expanding its supper meal program beginning on Monday. Meals will be available from 4-5:30 p.m. at eight schools in the metro area. Students can eat for free at the schools, and adults can take a meal to go for $4.
“We have long known that our work does not end with the education of our scholars in our classrooms,” Superintendent Errick Greene said at the press conference.
Horhn called on federal lawmakers to “come to their senses” and end the government shutdown. 
“You hear the news about what’s going on with the federal shutdown, but a lot of times we don’t really connect with the impact the shutdown is having on people, on citizens, everyday folks who are just struggling from day to day to make ends meet,” he said. 
Even in times without a crisis, food insecurity is an issue in Jackson, with 33,000 people in Hinds County relying on SNAP, the mayor said. With the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill mandating changes to food assistance to include work requirements for older people and more parents with teenagers, some Jacksonians could lose SNAP even after the federal shutdown ends.
But the wholesale pause of SNAP benefits in November is an extraordinary moment, said Bill Washington, the food pantry manager at New Horizon Church, one of the largest pantries in the metro area.
“So we’ve got to do extraordinary things to overcome this situation,” he said. 
About $6.5 million comes into Hinds County every month because of SNAP, and every dollar spent has nearly double the impact on the local economy, said Jane Alexander, president and CEO of the Community Foundation of Mississippi. This means Hinds County is facing a potential loss of nearly $18 million. Grocery stores will be impacted by the SNAP suspension. So will the city’s sales tax collection. 
To counter this, Alexander said the Community Foundation of Mississippi is looking at restarting an initiative from the pandemic in which they provide about $25 on bulk grocery cards. She has already been in touch with grocery stores throughout the metro area and hopes the foundation will be able to offer the cards as soon as it has the funding. 
“The one single tenant of disaster emergency response is to try to keep the money flowing through the local economy as much as you can,” she said. 
Many food pantries in the metro area limit residents to one box a week, Alexander said, and will be quickly overwhelmed by the need. 
“For an economy that’s very fragile, it has very narrow margins already,” she said. “We want to make sure that when benefits are restored and when some of these efforts pay off, that these outlets are still available in our community.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/31130306/DSC_0549.jpg,,,2025-10-31 16:01:31.338899

William Lawrence, Democratic congressional candidate in Michigan’s 7th District, is holding a 30-hour vigil and food drive outside of the district office of U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), in protest of the expected lapse in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, also known as SNAP, starting on Nov. 1. 
Lawrence’s team is collecting food to donate to the Greater Lansing Food Bank, and as of about 1 p.m. Friday, had raised an additional $800 in online and cash donations since the vigil began, at that point about 19 hours prior. 
“We’re here in front of Barrett’s office because he is responsible for the SNAP benefits expiring, along with the rest of the Congressional Republicans,” Lawrence said. “If he’s not going to do his part to keep Michigan families fed, we’re gonna do so.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Tom Barrett would rather take food from the hungry than provide care to the sick,” he added. “The easy solution here is to save the Affordable Care Act and keep necessary food assistance.”

“People are going through far worse,” Larence said as it started to rain. “I’m more than happy to sit in the cold for a few hours to call attention to the fact that other people are going hungry and are going bankrupt because of their medical bills. That’s what’s at stake here, and it’s a real pleasure to draw attention to these issues.”
Another Democrat in the race to unseat Barrett, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, stopped by the vigil, which will last until midnight on Friday, to donate food. 
“I’m really happy to see all of the candidates come out in support of this, on the Democratic side, to call out Tom Barrett and ask him to show leadership with the Republicans in D.C., because all of these things are hurting the people of our community,” Brink said. “We should and we must take care of our most vulnerable.”
Kimberly Phillips, a retired nurse in the Lansing area, also brought food donations to Lawrence’s event. 
“Whatever we can do to get food out there for people who need a helping hand,” she said as to why she came out.

Around Lawrence’s food drive, messages in chalk were scrawled on the sidewalk, which were there when Lawrence and his team arrived. The chalk messages were condemned by Barrett’s office in a statement, where he said, “my congressional office in Lansing was vandalized by a group of trespassers during a political rally of left-wing activists.”
“There is a clear distinction between peaceful protest and harassment, and this failed attempt to intimidate me crossed a line and will not be tolerated,” he continued, adding that the vandalism had taken place during a rally held by Climate Action Campaign, Michigan Families for Fair Care, and Sierra Club Michigan.

Messages in chalk included “Don’t let our kids starve Tom!” and “Show your face Tom.” 
Lawrence noted that he had not yet seen Barrett while hosting his food drive, but that the Congressman’s staff had called the police on Lawrence and his team, who were seated on public property.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Most students who applied for South Carolina’s private K-12 tuition aid program this year were either already attending private school or homeschooled, according to data from the Department of Education.
The law signed by Gov. Henry McMaster in May provided $7,500 scholarships to 10,000 students this school year. It’s unknown exactly how many parents received state aid for tuition they previously paid for themselves. It appears the education agency didn’t actually collect that information.
Instead, the Education Scholarship Trust Fund application asked whether students were entering kindergarten, attended a public school last year, or something else — officially, “other.” Parents selected that “other” category on 59% of the 16,127 applications submitted by mid-August, according to agency data provided to the SC Daily Gazette through a public records request.
They likely attended a private school, though some may have been homeschooled, said Felicity Ropp, whose job with Palmetto Promise Institute involves helping parents sign up for the program. The law does not allow state scholarships for homeschooling.
Also unclear is how many — and which — students ended up on a waitlist. This year, the 10,000 slots were filled on a first-come, first-served basis. According to the application data, at least 10% of parents reported making too much to qualify. But the education agency has not provided a breakdown of how many applicants were deemed ineligible or other specifics about students accepted into the program, including their previous schooling.


Applicants for 2025-26
By mid-August, parents submitted applications for 16,127 students. Here’s the type of school they attended in 2024-25:

None — incoming kindergartener: 2,078
Public school: 3,692
Public charter school: 775
Other: 9,582

Source: S.C. Department of Education


It makes sense that parents of students in private school were quick to apply, said Patrick Kelly, lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association.
Private schools and private choice advocates were providing information to parents, and getting a scholarship would save them money, he added.
But public schools weren’t spreading the word. The details were also unknown when sign-ups started in mid-January under the previous law — just as debate on the legislation started.
“No one’s going to apply for a program they don’t know exists,” Kelly said, adding that public schools should do a better job of telling parents the money is available.
Application windows
For students getting a scholarship this year — as well as any of their siblings — the early application period for slots next school year opens Saturday, as required by the law passed in the spring. Legislators put priority windows in the law for first dibs on the state-funded scholarships.
The next application round starts Jan. 15 for students attending a public school this year, families making up to 300% of the federal poverty level, and/or children of active-duty military personnel stationed in South Carolina.
Everyone else who’s eligible can start applying Feb. 9. For next school year, that means all families with incomes up to 500% of the federal poverty level. A family of four, for example, qualifies as long as the parents’ income is no more than $160,750, according to the latest poverty guidelines, which increase annually.
By law, at least 15,000 students will be enrolled for aid in 2026-27. The scholarship amount, which rises with state increases in public school spending, is expected to be at least $7,600, according to the Department of Education.
How many students get the taxpayer aid will likely be part of next year’s budget debate. The law set 15,000 as the minimum availability for 2026-27 and beyond. If more eligible students apply, as occurred for this year’s 10,000-student cap, legislators can fund more scholarships.
Up to 1,000 ineligible SC students booted from voucher program, report finds

That is, unless another legal challenge brings payments to a halt.
A state Supreme Court ruling in September 2024 stopped payments for private tuition soon after the program’s start. Justices found those scholarships violated the state constitution’s ban on public money directly benefiting private education. Private donors paid tuition for about 800 students so they could stay in their private schools last school year.
Republican legislators made passing a law to restart the state aid their top priority for 2025. Whether the law signed in May legally skirts the constitution’s rule will likely again be a question for the state’s highest court.
Another lawsuit is coming, said Dena Crews, president of the South Carolina Education Association, which sued last time.
Its lawyers are still gathering and reviewing data as they seek to prove the money still provides a “direct benefit” to private schools.
“Who’s getting the money?” Crews said about the aid. “Is it truly going to families who want to move their child from public school to private school, or is it helping out private schools and their budgets?”
She had no estimate for when the association will file the suit.
Who applied
Under the previous law signed in 2023, students entering the program had to be leaving a public school or entering kindergarten.
The new law threw those limitations out the window.
As long as families meet income eligibility rules, they can apply. For the 10,000 slots this school year, families couldn’t earn more than 300% of the federal poverty level, which is $96,450 for a family of four.
SC House passes bill to revive K-12 vouchers. The bulk of this year’s money will go unused.

The scholarships will be a big help to many parents with students in private school, Ropp said.
Just because they were paying for tuition doesn’t mean they’re well off financially. They may have been scraping by to put their child in private school, she said.
The state aid can also be used for other expenses, such as tutoring and computers, she noted.
“Having any kind of financial relief is just a huge deal for these families,” Ropp said.
According to the application data, just over half of the students, or 8,500, were eligible for Medicaid. That means their parents made less than 210% of federal poverty levels, or $66,900 for a family of four. For over 10% of students, or 1,700, their parents reported incomes above this year’s limits, according to the data.
When legislators passed the 2023 law, supporters presented it as a lifeline for poor children stuck in a failing school because their parents couldn’t afford any other option. But opening it up to existing private school students changes the mission, said Sen. Russell Ott, who opposes the program.
“This is clearly not about trying to help poor kids escape failing schools,” the St. Matthews Democrat said. “What this has morphed into is subsidization of private schools and doing it with public dollars.”
Sen. Wes Climer said his support was never limited to any income bracket. He wants to expand the program even further to make all children eligible for a state scholarship — what’s known as universal school choice.
“The purpose of the program is to provide for robust competition in the education arena,” said the Rock Hill Republican, who’s running for Congress.
SC K-12 school voucher program hits 10,000-student cap, with thousands more rejected

According to the application data, the parents of about 70% of the students reported their children would attend a private school this year. Less than 15% reported wanting to use the money to enroll in a different public school. The rest marked “other,” without clarifying.
If most of the students accepted into the program used it to pay private tuition, those schools might increase tuition, pricing out the students least able to pay the difference, Kelly said.
During debate on the legislation, Republicans repeatedly rejected proposals to cap tuition or bar price hikes on students in the program.
“This time next year, no one should be surprised that the average private school tuition went up in South Carolina,” Kelly said. “That’s the next step.”
Where the money went
For the first half of last school year, Best Buy received far more money than any other single vendor, with families spending nearly $1.4 million there. Another $240,000 went to Staples, according to data from the education agency, which stops on Jan. 17.
That’s the date Rep. Neal Collins, R-Easley, requested a report to share for debate on the House floor. The SC Daily Gazette asked for spending figures through the end of the school year, but the agency wanted more than $2,300 to provide it.
About half of the report’s spending came after the state Supreme Court’s Sept. 11, 2024, ruling, which immediate stopped payments to private schools. The rest of the law stayed intact, allowing families to use their money for other eligible expenses, such as computers.

Even though payments for private tuition had to stop just one month into the school year, a handful of private schools were among the top recipients of money the first semester.
Among schools, Westgate Christian School in Spartanburg topped the list at $63,236, indicating a lot of its students received scholarships. Tuition at Westgate ranges from $5,600 for elementary school to $5,800 for high school, according to the school’s website. Administrators did not respond to a request for comment.
“It’s up to the parents to decide where to send their students,” Ropp said.
Who’s running the program
The new law added a trustee to oversee the program as a response to the state Supreme Court’s concerns. Putting a third-party trustee in charge of scholarship transfers, supporters argued, gets around the constitution’s ban of a “direct benefit” to private schools. Whether justices agree will be for them to decide.
The Department of Education selected Columbia accountant Mark Hobbs on May 28, just three weeks after the law was signed, according to a contract the SC Daily Gazette obtained through a public records request.
It shows that accountants at Hobbs’ firm, The Hobbs Group, will receive $400 per hour to work on parents’ accounts. All other staff will make $125 to $200 per hour.
The agency did not respond to a request for Hobbs’ resume or answer questions about how many people applied.
The law allows the trustee to take up to 5% of the trust fund as payment for overseeing the accounts. The agency must report the actual dollar figure to the Legislature’s budget writers by Dec. 31.
Parents access the scholarship money through an online portal. They do not actually receive any dollars, and they can’t get reimbursed. They must direct through the portal where to send the money.
Hobbs’ job is to move the money to parents’ accounts through four equal installments and then pay the approved vendors, according to his contract.

A retired state judge on Friday denied requests from embattled McKinley County District Attorney Bernadine Martin for an extension in her case. Rather, Martin must respond by early November to the New Mexico Department of Justice’s petition to remove her from office in advance of a three-day trial starting Dec. 1.
The state Supreme Court ruled earlier this month it would move forward with a trial in response to Attorney General Raúl Torrez’s August petition, which cited alleged violations of state law by Martin, among other concerns.
For instance, the petition alleges Martin created a hostile workplace environment; failed to prepare or subpoena witnesses in McKinley County; breached procurement law, despite a prior settlement with state ethics officials; had an “improper reliance” on contract attorneys; and said she continued to work in private legal practice while serving as district attorney, in violation of state law.
In September, New Mexico Department of Justice attorneys took over prosecution of two cases in the Eleventh Judicial District, alleging Martin had improperly dismissed the cases and failed to send them to an outside prosecutor.
State law for the removal of public officials requires a trial without a jury before the Supreme Court justices and establishes the court’s decision as final.
The state’s Supreme Court appointed Special Master Alan Malott, a retired Albuquerque district judge, to act as a trial judge.
In a virtual hearing on Friday, Malott told Martin’s attorney Kathryn Hardy that the court could not accommodate the request for an additional 30 days to respond to the state’s requests for documents, saying the case, which he called a matter of “extreme public interest, has “very tight timelines.”
Malott also noted that any formal objection to the Supreme Court’s order to hold a three-day trial in Santa Fe beginning on Dec. 1, or any other deadlines, would be due by Tuesday, Nov. 4.
Martin has denied all allegations in court filings. A voicemail and text message to Martin were not returned before publication.
In court filings, Martin has argued that the state law allowing for removal of district attorneys should only apply to her current term, which started in January of 2025, after her reelection to office in 2024. She argued it would be “obviously unjust” for the New Mexico Supreme Court to hear evidence “for misconduct [that] may have occurred during a previous term.” She further said the removal of district attorneys should be left either to the state Legislature or voters “when the public official stands for reelection.”
The New Mexico Department of Justice has disagreed, citing state laws that district attorneys may be removed from office in a court proceeding, for certain reasons including: “failure, neglect or refusal” to perform the duties of the office.

“This is an opportunity for all of us together as Iowans, to care for our neighbors in need,” Gov. Kim Reynolds said Friday about the state’s decision to help Iowa food banks as they support Iowans impacted by the anticipated lapse in federal nutrition funding. 
Due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, have been informed they would not receive November benefit allotments, if the shutdown persists. 
Iowa food banks said they anticipate “unprecedented” need, across the state, as SNAP benefits cards are empty. Reynolds said the state’s pledged match, along with plans to deploy National Guard troops to help with food distribution, will provide “interim support” to Iowa’s six food banks.

Reynolds joined other GOP lawmakers in blaming the shutdown on congressional Democrats, who have withheld their votes on Republican stopgap spending measures in an effort to address the expiration of tax credits that help reduce the cost of health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act.
“Dems in the United States Senate don’t seem to care that everyday Americans are suffering while they force the shutdown into another month,” Reynolds said. “We do care here in Iowa, and I know that Iowans do too.” 
Beginning Saturday, existing state funds from the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services will be used to match monetary donations to Iowa food banks, up to $1 million.

Reynolds said she believes the $1 million match will be met based on the “generosity of Iowans and corporate partners” in the state. 
Already, several local businesses like Big Grove Brewery, Hy-Vee, Fareway and Iowa Pork Producers Association have contributed, or pledged, more than $130,000 in cash and food donations to food banks. 
Iowa’s three Medicaid managed care organizations have each committed to donate $100,000 across the six food banks. 
Some states plan to utilize their funds to continue issuing SNAP benefits during the government shutdown. Asked why she chose to match food bank donations instead of using emergency state funds for SNAP, Reynolds pointed to the ongoing shutdown.
“It’s ridiculous,” she said. “Democrats could have voted to keep the government open, and they did not,” the governor said. 
Reynolds opposed the Senate Democrats’ use of a government shutdown as a “negotiating tactic” to try and extend funding for the Affordable Care Act, which she called the “unaffordable” care act. 
“We need to get the government open, we need to continue the budget as is, and then come to the table and negotiate what they want to talk about moving forward,” Reynolds said. 
Democratic attorneys general from nearly two dozen states have sued the Trump administration, urging it to use U.S. Department of Agriculture contingency funds to keep the program afloat during the shutdown. Reynolds also called this lawsuit “ridiculous.”
Iowa alone receives close to $45 million in SNAP benefits each month, according to USDA. 
“We can’t just shift it to the state,” Reynolds said. “States don’t have the funds to be able to do that.” 
Iowa Democrats submitted a letter Thursday to Reynolds and Attorney General Brenna Bird, urging Reynolds to take “immediate action” to protect SNAP benefits in the state and Bird to join other states in the lawsuit calling for the use of contingency funds.
Senate Democratic Leader Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, Republican leaders are “playing political games” with the country’s well-being.
“Legislative Democrats have spoken in unison and outlined to Gov. Reynolds and Attorney General Bird a plan for state government to step into the gap and prevent Iowans – our friends and neighbors – from going hungry.”
National Guard deployment 
In addition to matching monetary donations to the food bank, Reynolds said National Guard troops will be deployed “as needed” to conduct food distribution missions. 
Adjutant General of the Iowa National Guard Stephen Osborn said the guard will take direction from HHS, but he anticipated the soldiers would help with the movement of food across the state and packing boxes of food for distribution. 
Osborn said he will first ask for volunteer soldiers, but will bring soldiers and airmen onto active state duty. 
While National Guardsmen on federal missions are unpaid during the government shutdown, Reynolds said these soldiers would be paid since it is a state mission. 
In addition to soldier support, the state’s Volunteer Iowa division is working to gather volunteers for food banks and pantries across the state. 
Reynolds has advocated for reform to the SNAP program in the past. In May, her proposed waiver to eliminate foods like candy and soft drinks from SNAP eligible food items was approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Reynolds said Friday that SNAP, and other federal support programs, have “so much fraud and abuse” that there is a risk of not having the funds to “help those who really need it.” 
According to USDA, nearly 42 million Americans, or 12.3% of residents, received SNAP benefits in 2024. The program serves nearly 270,000 Iowans each month. 
Reynolds said a program of that size needs a “comprehensive review.” 
“My hope is that first of all, the Senate Democrats will stop keeping the government closed and open it back up and really start having those kind of conversations about what we do moving forward,” Reynolds said.

(Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]POINT PLEASANT — Fox News host Sean Hannity riled up a crowd in this Ocean County town Thursday by reading off polls that show the governor’s race in New Jersey is a dead heat between Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill. 
“I came up here because this is a huge political earthquake. It will rock the nation. It will reverberate all across the country. I really believe it, and I’m fascinated by it, and the country’s fascinated by it,” Hannity said ahead of the taping of a town hall for his nightly show at the Crystal Point Yacht Club. 
Once Ciattarelli joined him on stage, Hannity asked the gubernatorial hopeful how he’s feeling going into Election Day on Tuesday.
“All I can tell you is when I go around the state, the energy is electric. The reception of minority communities has been overwhelmingly positive. And when Democratic mayors across the state are endorsing the Republican nominee, it does a world of good,” Ciattarelli said. 
Hannity’s appearance attracted an enthusiastic crowd. The influential conservative commentator told the crowd before the taping began that he had spoken to President Donald Trump and confirmed Trump would be watching the town hall later.
Hannity asked the crowd of 200 people if they could trust Sherrill. They booed and said “no.” He also referenced allegations that Sherrill was caught up in a cheating scandal during her time at the Naval Academy (she did not participate in her 1994 graduation ceremony, an act she says was punishment for not turning in her classmates).
“We invited Mikie Sherrill on this program to respond to these allegations, but her team just never gets back to us. They must be very busy,” Hannity said.
A spokesperson for the Sherrill campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Most public polling shows Ciattarelli trailing behind Sherrill by single digits. They’re vying to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a term-limited Democrat who will leave office in January.
Both campaigns have brought out big names for the final stretch of the election cycle. Ciattarelli has made stops with Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Florida) and Vivek Ramaswamy of Ohio, and held a tele-rally with Trump last week. Sherrill is set to appear with former President Barack Obama in Newark on Saturday.
Throughout the hour-long taping with Hannity, Ciattarelli repeated much of his regular stump speech, touting his plans to do away with the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive, get rid of cashless bail, pull out of the regional greenhouse gas initiative, and prevent wind turbines from being constructed off the Jersey Shore. 
“Executive order No. 1, on day one, no town in this state will be a sanctuary city. We will not be a sanctuary state,” Ciattarelli said. 
He added that many of Murphy’s policies were done by executive order, like the Immigrant Trust Directive, and never became law, which means he can do away with them immediately.
“Having sanctuary cities and us being a sanctuary state encourages illegal immigration, and it handcuffs our local police in certain ways. We’re not doing that,” he said.
Hannity criticized New Jersey’s high taxes, reading off the corporate business tax, gas tax, inheritance tax, and top individual tax rate. 
“I refuse to be the governor of that state. We’re going to change that when we win, I’m telling you that right now,” Ciattarelli said.
The two men were joined by Harris Faulkner, a Fox News anchor and New Jersey resident. She said New Jerseyans are worried about affordability, lamented about her utility bills, and griped about a gas station in Edgewater that charges $5 a gallon. The Lukoil on River Road in Edgewater was charging $4.55 a gallon for premium gas on Friday (regular was $2.89).
“It feels like they’re trafficking in high taxes, because the current governor said when he ran the last time, ‘If taxes are your issue, then New Jersey is not for you,’” she said.
Ciattarelli stressed the importance of attracting independent voters and people who typically only turn out for presidential elections every four years.
“We say to them, ‘Do you love this state? Are you angry about everything that’s going on? You got to turn out in the governor’s race too,’” he said. “We’ve done a magnificent job.”

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)Pat Hurley Thornburg, a former state legislator from Randolph County, wants state government retirees to get cost-of-living adjustments, often called COLAs. 
As a member of the boards that make recommendations on state and local government pensions, she’s in a position to push for them. 
Thornburg came to the trustees meeting Thursday prepared with a chart showing that retired state employees and teachers received COLAs nearly every year from 1981 to 2008. From 2009 on, they’ve received small increases, one-time bonuses, or nothing at all. 
“I don’t understand why it happens,” she said. “It really bothers me.” 
Retirees have lost purchasing power to rising inflation, she said. 
The state pension trustees could be in a position to recommend that the legislature grant state retiree cost-of-living increases in the next budget. It all depends on how pension fund returns perform through December.
Before 2008, it was easy for the pension fund to reach its earnings targets. That allowed the financial breathing room to increase pension checks for retired state government employees and teachers. 
That changed with the 2008 financial crisis. 
“We were in a very different economic environment,” said Sam Watts, executive director of the NC Retirement Systems. 
For years, North Carolina’s pension returns ranked at or near the bottom compared to other states’ pensions. But earnings have improved since January, with investment returns hitting 10.8% through Sept. 30. That’s close to the average performance of other large public pension plans. 
The state and local pension funds have separate trustee boards, but the boards meet at the same time and some members serve on both boards. 
The state pension board tells the legislature whether there’s enough money to finance cost-of-living adjustments from the fund for state retirees and teachers. It makes the recommendation, but legislators don’t have to accept it. 
The local government pension board makes decisions on COLAs for those retirees. 
Trustees must balance a number of factors in determining whether the respective funds can afford to pay COLAs, including investment returns, liabilities, and salary increases for people still working.
The boards will make those decisions in January. 
State Treasurer Brad Briner says as it looks now, it’s more likely that the state pension trustees will be able to recommend the legislature include COLAs in the next state budget than it is for local pension trustees to give local government retirees cost-of-living increases.
Neither the state retiree pension plan nor the local government retiree plan are what’s called “fully funded,” meaning that they have enough to pay current beneficiaries as well as meet future obligations to people still working who will qualify for pensions. But the local government plan is a few points further from the mark than the state retiree plan. 
Tim O’Connell, whose Retired Government Employee Association represents both state and local retirees, reminded trustees that local government retirees have gone nearly 20 years without COLAs.
“It’s been a tough 15, 20 years,” he said. 
“Everything you can do in this room, please do it for the retirees,” he said. “We’re working for the future as well, but the current retirees really bear the burden of some tough times.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4832-1024x569.jpg,,,2025-10-31 15:17:06.194158

The lawmakers’ request, sent in a letter to the Virginia Office of the State Inspector General Sept. 29, stems from campaign ads for Miyares and public events that seek to tie specific reoffenders to Democratic opponent Jay Jones’ past vote in favor of a law that allows inmates to trim their time behind bars. 
The letter was signed by Sens. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, and Dels. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, and Vivian Watts, D-Fairfax. Together, they expressed a series of concerns: whether Miyares had access to confidential information and if it violated laws to disclose the details, whether the information sharing was a “use of state resources” for campaign activities, and whether public confidence could be undermined that release decisions and sentence credits are determined by law, “not by political convenience.” 
The inclusion of a particular offender’s status, “coupled with the Attorney General’s claims regarding earned sentence credits, suggest information not otherwise available to the public,” the lawmakers wrote. “This position clearly indicated that the information could not be disclosed under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act.”
Dubbed Enhanced Earned Sentence Credits, the five-year old law has allowed inmates with good behavior the ability to be released early. Though it passed in 2020 — when Miyares and Jones were both members of the legislature — its implementation was blocked for years by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, at Miyares’ request. With last year’s reconviction rate at 19% and reincarceration rate at 5%, the program is under fresh scrutiny this year amid the Miyares and Jones matchup. 
Despite the lawmakers’ request, OSIG said that it can’t investigate the data sharing between VADOC and Miyares because Miyares, the governor or a grand jury would have to request such an inquiry, per state code. 
“We were trying to get them to investigate the VADOC side of it,” Simon said in a recent call. 
 Inconsistent information

In ads and on the campaign trail, Miyares claimed that 70 Virginians had died as a result of the program, but a Cardinal News analysis of data from his office refutes that claim. 
Miyares spokesperson Shaun Kenney told Cardinal that absent a state-directed study, “VADOC remains partially equipped with the tools or resources to accurately measure the full impact of EESC and is only able to offer a fractional view by which the public can ascertain its impact.”
What data has been shared with Miyares and the media offers some insights, however. 
VADOC data shared with The Mercury by House Republican Caucus communications director Garren Shipley shows percentages of EESC recipients who reoffended broken down by different types and whether or not they were reincarcerated — but it does not identify specific offenders by name. In that data, reoffenses for murder or manslaughter were minimal, much like the Cardinal inquiry found.   
Records requested by The Richmond Times-Dispatch — which prompted lawmakers’ letter to OSIG — yielded a response from VADOC that qualification for EESC was a “protected record” and that a list of recipients’ names “does not exist.” 
The Times-Dispatch had been looking into reoffender Tabias McClain, who should have been disqualified from using EESC due to a malicious wounding charge from when he was a minor, but was able to use the program because the charge didn’t transfer over when he aged out of Department of Juvenile Justice and into VADOC. Miyares singled McClain out during a July press conference hosted with the family of a woman McClain hit and killed with his car while speeding through a residential neighborhood after his release.
Meanwhile, The Mercury had asked for information about serial sex offender Daniel Vanover, a man also mentioned at Miyares’ conference and the subject of advertisements for Miyares’ re-election campaign. The ads claim was Vanover was able to rape a minor “because of Jay Jones’ law.” 
When asked by The Mercury, VADOC confirmed that Vanover received EESC while serving a 2022 sentence for a probation violation — the year the sex crimes happened after his release. However, court sentencing records indicate the rapes occured between May 9, 2022 and Dec. 8, 2022 — over two months before VADOC confirmed his Aug. 17, 2022 release date in emails. 
Additional court records that are available in an online database also indicate Vanover’s sexual assaults of a minor began on May 9, 2022.
Spokespeople for VADOC did not further elaborate when asked about the discrepancy in the dates, but said that the record “reflects the data of the offense for all 11 counts of rape as a range” for those dates. No additional documentation was provided and calls to VADOC director Chad Dotson went unanswered. Multiple calls to Vanover’s defense attorney from that time also went unanswered. 
While further details about the discrepancy could not be gleaned by the time of this publication, there still may have been a reason, American University professor TaLisa Carter explained.
She said “the first and last dates don’t necessarily sync with the first and last incidents” and noted how the criminal justice system is “inclusive rather than exclusive.” 
 Politics vs. people

Though questions have lingered among journalists and lawmakers alike, the highly politicized early release program still stands as campaign fodder — to the dismay of EESC beneficiaries who have successfully reformed their lives and worry the door they walked through could eventually be closed behind them. 
Lynchburg-area resident and former inmate Reece Neenan, who used EESC, previously described the new chapter of life as a “whirlwind of goodness” as he’s landed a stable job, reconnected with family and started college. 
“Of course” there are fellow EESC beneficiaries who have reoffended, Neenan said. 
“But for the most part, people I know out here are staying out of trouble because it’s easy now.”
Hampton Roads resident Sam Harris, who started a nonprofit and was recently hired in Suffolk’s public defender office to counsel people navigating the criminal justice system, told The Mercury that he wants to “be a face for second chances.” 
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, has previously suggested Miyares and the governor may have tried to “undermine the effectiveness of the program” to fit political narratives.
When The Mercury recently examined the program’s effectiveness since fully implemented in the past year, neither Jones or Miyares followed through on requests for interviews.
In his own letter to Dotson earlier this summer, Surovell suggested the legislature explore ways to ensure EESC functions appropriately rather than dismantle it. As courts have previously ruled that VADOC unlawfully kept certain inmates behind bars in violation of EESC, paired with Miyares’ and Youngkin’s previous blocking of the program, Surovell posited that the “whipsawing” had made it difficult for VADOC to “plan and implement the existing system.”
Democratic colleagues Simon, Ebbin, Watts and Locke wrote in their letter to OSIG that they are “deeply concerned” Miyares may have pressured VADOC “to adjust its practices in ways that advantage” his campaign. 
“If true, this would represent a profound breach of the public trust,” they wrote.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Indiana philanthropic organizations and an anonymous donor have pooled $1 million to launch a food aid fund, the United Way of Central Indiana announced Thursday — with federal grocery benefits for low-income Americans set to run dry Nov. 1 amid a government shutdown.
“Food is not a privilege; it’s a basic human right,” said Fred Payne, United Way of Central Indiana’s president and CEO. “United Way is proud to stand alongside its partners and other funders to respond to this critical need and help hard-working families put food on the table.”
GOP squashes food aid for Hoosiers impacted by SNAP disruption

More than 571,000 Hoosiers were receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as of September, according to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.
Approximately 150,000 SNAP recipients reside in central Indiana alone — Boone, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, Marion, Morgan and Putnam counties — according a news release. About half of participants are in families with children.
Beginning next week, the new Central Indiana Food Relief Fund will distribute the money to groups that supply food to hundreds of pantries across the region and state: Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana, Midwest Food Bank of Indiana and Second Helpings.
The fund was launched with a $500,000 donation from an anonymous donor, which was intended to encourage the community to match or exceed that amount, according to the release.
The Indianapolis Foundation, Lilly Endowment and the Lilly Foundation contributed, quickly meeting that match.
Indiana residents are also encourage to donate to the fund directly — United Way will manage the account, but 100% of gifts will be distributed — or to the three food organizations.
“Philanthropy alone cannot fill this gap,” Payne said. “But we are calling on our community right now to join us, support our food banks and help our neighbors in need.”
Those in need of food assistance can use Indy Hunger Network’s Community Compass to find free food and groceries near them, along with other resources.

Free.,Trump administration blocked from cutting off SNAP benefits as two judges issue orders,"Jacob Fischler, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-blocked-cutting-snap-benefits-two-judges-issue-orders,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Boston ruled Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to pause a food assistance program for 42 million people was illegal — but gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her finding before she decides on a motion to force the benefits be paid despite the ongoing government shutdown.At nearly the same time Friday, a Rhode Island federal judge in a similar case brought by cities and nonprofit groups ordered USDA to continue payments and granted a request for a temporary restraining order.In Massachusetts, in a Friday afternoon order, District Court of Massachusetts Judge Indira Talwani said she would continue to take “under advisement” a coalition of Democratic states’ request to force the release of funds from a contingency account holding about $6 billion.Her ruling came a day before a cutoff of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits to low-income households.Because Congress is locked in a stalemate over a stopgap spending bill and did not appropriate money for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, administration officials say the program cannot provide federal funds beginning Saturday. In states, SNAP benefits are loaded onto cards on varying dates, but the cutoff would be effective for November benefits.Talwani, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, called the administration’s conclusion it can’t provide SNAP funding “erroneous,” and said the reserve fund was sufficient for SNAP benefits to flow to states and the vendors that add money to debit-like cards issued to the program’s beneficiaries that are used to purchase groceries. The law creating the program mandated that benefits continue, she said.“Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds,” Talwani wrote.Talwani ordered the administration to say by Monday whether it would provide at least partial benefits for November.The 25 states that sued were Massachusetts, California, Arizona, Minnesota, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state, Wisconsin Kansas, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. The District of Columbia also sued. In Rhode Island, where the judge granted a temporary restraining order, the advocacy group Democracy Forward, which was among those bringing the suit, praised the move.“A federal court today granted a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump-Vance administration’s unlawful effort to halt the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the ongoing government shutdown,” the group said.”The decision ensures that millions of children, seniors, veterans, and families will continue to receive essential food assistance while the case proceeds.”The judge in that case, John James McConnell Jr., said the administration’s actions violated a key federal administrative law against arbitrary and capricious executive action and federal spending laws “by disregarding Congress’s direction that SNAP must continue operating,” Democracy Forward said.McConnell also was appointed by Obama.Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.This is a developing report and will be updated.",,,,2025-10-31 14:57:04.840890

Daphne Huang, who had legally represented the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare as a deputy attorney general, was fired months after Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador took office in 2023. 
Idaho Attorney General’s Office asks judge to dismiss fired attorney’s whistleblower lawsuit

In September, Idaho 4th District Judge Jonathan Medema dismissed Huang’s lawsuit, preventing the case from going to a jury trial. In his ruling, the judge wrote “no rational juror could find” that Huang “had proven any of her claims.” 
Many of her lawsuit’s claims revolved around Labrador’s investigation into the Department of Health and Welfare’s handling of $72 million in child care grants. 
In her appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court filed on Oct. 23, Huang’s attorneys wrote that the ruling “erred by holding that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact” related to her lawsuit’s claim under the state’s whistleblower law, called Idaho’s Protection of Public Employees Act. 
Labrador’s spokesperson, Damon Sidur, declined to comment on the appeal. The Attorney General’s Office has argued Huang was fired for misconduct.
Hours before Huang’s firing in March 2023, she expressed ethical concerns about the ethics of the Idaho Attorney General’s Office new management, according to records released in the lawsuit. 
Before firing her, Labrador didn’t look into Huang’s concerns, he said in a deposition. 
“I had no concerns. It was clear that she was not acting in good faith. And it was clear that she was already preparing for litigation,” Labrador said.
Huang filed her lawsuit in September 2023.

To understand the resolve of salmon advocates — and the frustration so many of us felt when the federal government recently reneged on a historic agreement, reigniting litigation — it’s helpful to review the legal history associated with protecting Columbia Basin salmon.
In a recent story about plaintiffs returning to court to protect Columbia Basin salmon, the Washington State Standard described the court battle as “long-running.” So true. 
The initial shot was fired in 1991 after Snake River sockeye salmon became the first Columbia Basin salmonid to be listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act . That listing requires federal agencies to ensure the protection and recovery of the fish. 
Federal agencies involved with the federal dams in the Columbia Basin include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (which operates dams on the lower Snake and lower Columbia rivers), the Bonneville Power Administration (which markets power from the dams), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which issues rulings on whether fish protection and recovery plans comply with the Endangered Species Act).
Since 1992, they’ve put forth no fewer than eight plans for operating the hydropower system while ostensibly protecting threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin. (By 1999, 12 more salmon and steelhead stocks had been listed under the Endangered Species Act.)
Over three decades of litigation, three different federal district judges have declared six different federal dam management plans illegal for their failure to protect salmon and steelhead. That includes every plan since 2000. The very first plan was invalidated in 1994 by U.S. District Judge Malcolm Marsh, who proclaimed that the “situation literally cries out for a major overhaul,” but found that the federal plan failed to deliver any such fundamental change.
Fast forward to 2005, when District Court Judge James Redden struck down a 2004 federal plan, a plan he later called a “cynical and transparent attempt to avoid responsibility for the decline of listed Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead.” 
In the following years, new plans were issued by the federal agencies in 2008, 2010, and 2014. Each was promptly struck down. After Redden’s retirement, Judge Michael Simon struck down the 2014 plan. Twice, the federal agencies tried appealing the district court rulings to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Twice, the circuit court upheld the district court.
The most recent plan, issued in the waning days of the first Trump administration, was promptly challenged, and was headed for the same fate as the prior plans, when the Biden administration decided not to defend the indefensible and entered into settlement talks with plaintiffs and Northwest states and tribes, with input from other stakeholders as well.
Those talks led to the adoption in 2023 of the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement, a package of investments, changes in dam operations, and studies on replacing the services of four especially lethal dams on the lower Snake River (so that the dams could be breached and 140 miles of free-flowing river restored). Litigation was stayed while that agreement was in place.
In June of this year, the second Trump administration unilaterally renounced the agreement, leaving nothing to replace it save the illegal 2020 Trump salmon plan. So, it’s back to court.
In various rulings over the years, the courts have ordered modest changes in dam operations, but the federal agencies have repeatedly refused to produce the “major overhaul” Judge Marsh called for 31 years ago. 
As a result, not one of the 13 listed populations is on a path to recovery. Despite misleading claims from federal agencies, public utilities, and other river user groups, most of those stocks are on a path to extinction.
It’s past time for the court to find a way to end more than three decades of stubborn evasion of the law by the federal agencies and direct them to, finally, produce a plan that will lead to restoration of abundant, harvestable populations of these iconic creatures.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/salmon.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 14:57:04.840890

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – About 280 new laws take effect Saturday, including an income tax cut.
House Bill 2764 reduces the state’s top income tax bracket by .25% from 4.75% to 4.5%. Most Oklahomans fall within the top bracket.
It also has a path toward elimination of the state’s income tax through revenue triggers.
It was a top priority of Gov. Kevin Stitt during the last legislative session.
The fiscal impact in fiscal year 2027 is $340.5 million.
House Bill 1389 expands insurance coverage for diagnostic mammograms.
Stitt vetoed the measure, but lawmakers overrode it.
Another measure, Senate Bill 1019, prohibits insurers from putting a time limit on the use of anesthesia during a medical or surgical procedure. It also bars insurers from restricting coverage or payment for time under anesthesia.
Senate Bill 176 gives women access to a six-month prescription of birth control.
House Bill 2263 makes it illegal to use a cell phone in a school zone or work zone. It has  exceptions for hands-free or voice-operated functions and to communicate with emergency or medical personnel.
Violators are subject to a fine of not more than $100.
Lawmakers overrode Stitt’s veto of the measure.
House Bill 2674 creates the Statewide Official Compensation Commission to set the salaries of statewide elected officers, such as the governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. The commission is prohibited from reducing salaries that were in effect as of Jan. 1, 2025.
Senate Bill 50 provides for a sales tax exemption for firearm and gun safety devices. Safety devices include a gun safe, lock box, trigger lock and barrel lock.
Lawmakers return to the Capitol on Feb. 2. 
It will be Stitt’s final session due to term limits.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As Trump administration officials move to suspend federal food assistance for 42 million Americans starting Saturday, New Jersey residents looking to food pantries for help have plenty of options.
About 813,000 low-income New Jersey residents across more than 436,000 households are expected to lose benefits they receive under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps.
Need help? New Jersey food banks can connect you to a food pantry near you:

The Community Food Bank of New Jersey partners with more than 800 agencies and community groups that run food pantries in Atlantic, Bergen, Cape May, Cumberland, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, and Union counties. Search by zip code for food pantries in those counties here.
The Food Bank of South Jersey has a searchable map here of over 150 food distribution sites in Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Salem counties, as well as a list of locations of mobile and school food pantries.
Fulfill provides food to nearly 300 pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, group homes, and more in Ocean and Monmouth counties. Check out Fulfill’s list of food pantries and soup kitchens here and mobile food pantry sites here.
Mercer Street Friends in Trenton partners with more than 100 pantries in Central Jersey. They have a free food-finder tool here.
Norwescap provides supplies for food pantries, soup kitchens, and child care and senior centers in Warren, Hunterdon, and Sussex counties. For Warren, look here, Sussex here, and Hunterdon here.
To find food assistance through the Southern Regional Food Distribution Center, which is based in Vineland, call 856-327-3145.

The state lists food pantries in 18 of New Jersey’s 21 counties here.
Many universities — including Rutgers, Rowan, and Ramapo — have food pantries on campus. Many are open to staff and administrators, as well as students.
Several counties direct residents to food assistance on their websites, including:

Bergen County lists food pantries in about 40 towns here.
Camden County lists pantries, home-delivered meals, related resources, and even a bagel cafe offering free bagels during the federal government shutdown here.
Cape May County offers this list of pantries.
Essex County lists eight pages of food pantries and soup kitchens here.
Gloucester County lists 10 churches and groups that provide food assistance here.
Hunterdon County’s pantries are listed here.
Middlesex County has a 29-page list of food assistance resources here.
Morris County lists its food pantries, meal services, and volunteer shopper programs here.
Somerset County offers this list of food assistance programs.
Union County lists about 50 pantries and kitchens here.
Warren County has more than 25 pantries, from Allamuchy to Washington, here.

Catholic Charities also runs food pantries in Dover, Franklin, Trenton, Brick, Burlington, Paterson, Phillipsburg, and more.
The New Jersey Food Council has also put together a list of groups and agencies that provide food assistance information and resources for shoppers affected by the SNAP funding lapse.
People who need assistance are recommended to call first, because hours vary. While some sites welcome walk-ins, others require appointments and may ask for proof of residency and/or income. Some distribute pre-packed bags of groceries, while others are set up more like supermarkets, where visitors can select what they want.
Most food pantries, soup kitchens, and other programs that help people in need welcome both financial donations and volunteers to stock shelves, distribute food, serve meals, and help with holiday drives.
The government’s SNAP suspension comes during the fifth week of the government shutdown. The Trump administration has held a hard line on funding for the program, refusing to release contingency funds meant to ensure payments continue through shutdowns, as a way to force Democrats to agree to a GOP plan to reopen the government.
State officials rushed $42.5 million in already-budgeted state funding to the state’s six biggest food banks on Friday to better prepare for the surge of visitors expected at food pantries and soup kitchens. 
A coalition of states, including New Jersey, has sued the federal government over the SNAP lapse.
The fate of federal benefits paid through the federal Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, program also remains uncertain. But New Jersey Department of Health officials said this week they expect funding for WIC benefits and services will continue without interruption through November. About 186,000 women, infants, and children were enrolled in WIC in New Jersey in 2024, according to Advocates for Children of New Jersey.

(Photo courtesy of Tiger Rag) LSU is parting ways with its athletics director hours after Gov. Jeff Landry publicly blasted him at a news conference and in a series of local and national media appearances this week.  
Scott Woodward is the sixth top administrator at the university to leave amid tense political circumstances. His exit follows that of President William Tate, Provost Roy Haggerty, LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick, chief administrative officer Kimberly Lewis and general counsel Winston DeCuir. 
Tate, Lewis and DeCuir are Black and left their posts as Landry pushed to remove the university away from diversity, equity and inclusion policy. Their departures constituted a purge of nearly every top Black administrator at the university. Several deans have also left, including Alena Allen, the first Black dean of the LSU Law Center.

Woodward’s downfall had been rumored for months. 
While adept with those on both sides of the aisle, Woodward’s own political history, having begun his career as a lobbyist, placed him at odds with the arch-conservative Landry, observers noted. 
Landry hit Woodward with both barrels after the weekend firing of football coach Brian Kelly after a resounding loss to Texas A&M. Kelly’s dismissal put LSU on the hook for the $54 million buyout provision in his contract. 
Landry hosted several board members, university officials and athletics administrators Sunday at the Governor’s Mansion to discuss Kelly’s contract. Neither Woodward nor interim LSU President Matt Lee were included in those discussions. 
“No, I can tell you right now, Scott Woodward is not selecting the next coach,” Landry said at a news conference Wednesday. “Hell, I’ll let Donald Trump select it before I let him do it.”
LSU Board of Supervisors member John Carmouche, a Landry appointee who chairs the board’s athletics subcommittee, denied Landry’s involvement in the decision to fire Woodward. 
“The governor is worried about the state of Louisiana. His concern had to do with the state contract,” Carmouche said.
Landry has said his interest in LSU’s coaching search protecting Louisiana taxpayers. He’s pointed to language in Kelly’s contract he said “makes the State liable for any debt” if private donors can’t or won’t cover the $54 million buyout.


As a public university, Landry is correct that the university, as a subdivision of the state, is ultimately liable. LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said Friday private donors and self-generated athletics revenue would cover Kelly’s buyout. 
While not tax dollars, the athletic department’s self-generated revenue is public money. All public universities in Louisiana like LSU are primarily funded with self-generated revenue, such as tuition and fee revenue. The spending of that revenue has to be approved by the legislature. Of the LSU System’s $1.2 billion budget for the current fiscal year, more than $800 million comes from self-generated revenue. 
Significant concern has been voiced recently at LSU over growing buyouts for college coaches. 
At a September meeting of the Board of Supervisors, Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, a Landry appointee and major campaign donor, brought up the financial impact to the university of buying out poorly performing coaches. It cost $17 million for the university to part ways with Ed Orgeron in the middle of the 2021 season. Mallet argued LSU should be the first to break the mold and drop the buyouts.
Landry has suggested LSU use an incentive-based contract to hire its next football coach, rather one with a guaranteed payout if the person is fired before their deal expires.  
Verge Ausberry, who was named interim athletics director Thursday, said the LSU board has not placed any constraints on him with regards to contract structure when tasking him to find Kelly’s replacement.
“I was told to get the best football coach there is, and don’t worry about that at all,” Ausberry said. “So my thing is, we’re going to go out there together as a team and get the best contract, get the best coach we have, and whatever it takes to get that person here, we will do.” 
Ballard said the search for Kelly’s replacement would not slow down for the hiring of the next president. The winning candidate for that position is slated to be announced Tuesday after three days of campus visits by the three finalists: McNeese State President Wade Rousse, former University of Arizona President Robert Robbins and University of Alabama Provost James Dalton. 
“Verge is going to move forward and knows what he needs to do,” Ballard said. “But depending on how that works out and when the new president starts … the new president will absolutely have input and hopefully hit the ground running.” 
Though he said his only focus is on hiring a football coach, Ausberry is considered to be a contender to replace Woodward on a permanent basis. A former player on the LSU football team in the mid-1980s, he has risen through the ranks of the athletic department over 24 years, the past six as its executive deputy director.
LSU suspended Ausberry from his job for 30 days without pay in 2021 for failing to properly report that LSU football player Drake Davis had admitted to Ausberry in 2018 that he had punched his girlfriend. 
Before that suspension, Ausberry was part of an LSU presidential search committee in 2020 but resigned when questions arose about what consequences he might face as part of his role in Title IX violations at the university. 


Landry’s involvement in forcing out Woodward and Kelly is not the first time he has taken an interest in LSU athletics. 
Last year, the governor called for universities to strip scholarships from athletes who didn’t participate in pregame national anthem ceremonies. His stance came after LSU women’s basketball coach Kim Mulkey was criticized in conservative circles when her team was not on the floor for the anthem before a high-profile NCAA Tournament game against Iowa. It is commonplace for college basketball and football teams to be in their locker rooms at that time.
Mulkey, who Woodward hired away from Baylor University in 2021, did not appear for a routine postgame recap with reporters after her team’s Thursday night exhibition game against Langston. In her place, assistant coach Bob Starkey was asked by a reporter to explain her absence.
“Yeah, she’s heartbroken,” Starkey said.    
Also in 2024, Landry called on LSU to resume its tradition bringing its live mascot, Mike, to the sidelines of Tiger Stadium for football games. When LSU declined, Landry arranged to rent a tiger, named Omar Bradley, from a Florida wildlife center to attend the LSU-Alabama game. The Crimson Tide wallopped LSU, 42-13, and Landry was criticized by fans who said he brought bad luck to the team. 
Landry was also displeased with Woodward’s refusal to rehire men’s basketball coach Will Wade, who Woodward had fired in 2022 amid a recruiting scandal, Yahoo Sports reported. Wade was hired at McNeese State, which played twice in the NCAA Tournament during his stay, and he is starting his first season this year at North Carolina State.

Ibarra, Deborah Brennan, Phoebe Huss and Chrissa Olson",,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/10/cal-fresh-snap-november-cliff/,More than five million low-income Californians are expected to lose their CalFresh food assistance benefits starting Saturday. States are suing the Trump administration to reinstate aid.,"In summary
More than five million low-income Californians are expected to lose their CalFresh food assistance benefits starting Saturday. States are suing the Trump administration to reinstate aid.


Each Thursday, food pantry workers in the city of Bellflower sort through breads, fresh produce and canned goods. Early risers line up with their bags, cardboard boxes and carts outside St. Dominic Savio Catholic Church, ready for distribution at 8 a.m.
For some, that routine became more urgent this week. Five-and-a-half million low-income Californians are enrolled in CalFresh, the state’s version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. With the federal government shut down and the Trump administration refusing to tap funds to keep food assistance on schedule, refrigerators are emptying, cupboards are running bare and fears are rising.   
“Without these food banks providing, I don’t know what we’re going to do,” said Miriam Hernandez, a Paramount resident who rushed to St. Dominic’s after dropping her children at school. 
Around the state, food pantries expect demand for goods to surge over the next several weeks. To help meet the need, California, county agencies and private groups are pouring in tens of millions of dollars in backfill funding. California Attorney General Rob Bonta this week joined other states in suing the federal government, seeking to restore federal financial support for SNAP programs, including CalFresh. The program was formerly known as food stamps, and now functions through debit cards. 
For about 3.5 million senior citizens and children who use CalFresh, food planning has already changed. 
Waiting in line, tote in hand, Hernandez said she’s been feeling nervous. To prepare for delays in receiving CalFresh benefits, she’s stopped by multiple food pantries in Los Angeles County, grateful for anything she can get her hands on.
Hernandez has six children, four of whom are still in school. Her husband is the main breadwinner, and with the rising price of groceries, she said CalFresh has been a huge help in her household — it’s largely how she buys meat and poultry. She is hopeful benefits will return soon, but in the meantime, she’ll have to make do with what she can find at pantries. Items like rice, lentils and beans can go a long way, she said. 
“Moms, we work it out with the little that we have, and we try to make a meal no matter how little it is,” she said. 
California, counties intervene
California has released $80 million to support food banks across the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom has also sent the California National Guard to help food banks pack and distribute food. 
Bonta joined National Guards and volunteers packing bell peppers and potatoes at the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank to make a point on Thursday. While the U.S. Department of Agriculture says it lacks funding to provide SNAP benefits to 40 million Americans, Bonta said the federal government has more than $5 billion in contingency funds earmarked for the program. A multi-state lawsuit demands that the federal government use those funds to avoid shutting the program down for the first time since it began in 1964. 
“Those funds are sitting there unspent and it is unconscionable, it is immoral, it is illegal,” Bonta said.

A federal judge in Boston has signaled that she may intervene. 
Even if the judge sides with California, Bonta said it could take “about a week” before benefits are reinstated to electronic debit cards.
Counties and local governments are also working to gather resources and aid. In San Francisco, supported in part by a private donor, the city will provide gift cards to CalFresh members to fully cover their November food benefits.
With millions of families across the state and country in limbo, food banks and pantries are becoming a lifeline for many more people. 
In North County San Diego Thursday, hundreds of families showed up to Interfaith Community Services in Escondido for an emergency food distribution with a regional partner, Feeding San Diego.
People waited in their vehicles for the drive-through food bank in a snarl of traffic that backed up outside the center. Each family received one or two boxes filled with fresh strawberries, apples and cucumbers, along with peanut butter, bread, canned beans and tuna, and a few treats, such as fruit popsicles and chocolate cake pops.
The organizations expected to serve 250 families, but stretched that to 270. On a normal day the Interfaith food pantry might serve 30 to 40 families.
“Today, people are panicked,” said Carissa Casares, a spokesperson for Feeding San Diego. “They’re thinking, how am I stocking my fridge? How am I filling my pantry?”

At the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, which partners with organizations across the county to bring pantries to churches, senior centers and schools, several factors have contributed to increased demand this year, said CEO Michael Flood.
In January, historic wildfires devastated Los Angeles communities. “And because those fires were so huge, that ripple effect is still there,” Flood said. Then in October, federal workers who aren’t getting paid because of the shutdown began requesting food boxes. Now with the suspension of CalFresh benefits, that need is likely to surge. About 1.5 million Angelenos rely on food assistance. 
His food bank is planning large distribution events for thousands of people similar to those organized during the pandemic. “This is a disaster type of situation for us here in Los Angeles County, throughout the state of California, and throughout the country,” he said. 
College students, recent graduates seek stability
Beyond the senior citizens and children who make up the majority of program participants, veterans, people with disabilities and young people are also trying to make ends meet. 
About 200,000 college students use the assistance program, and some continue to do so even after they graduate.
A third-year international development student at UCLA, Jade Duarte, said her entire family relies on CalFresh. 
“My grandfather just had open-heart surgery,” she said. “He’s dependent on good nutrition to recover, right? So things like this would hinder, essentially, his way of recovery, because they’re cutting his money.”
For her own needs, Duarte seeks support beyond her family’s CalFresh. A food pantry at UCLA offers quick meals like ramen. But demand exceeds what food banks can provide, she said. “It’s not going to be able to take care of the whole situation.”
On college campuses around the state, demand is growing at basic needs centers that serve as resource hubs, connecting students with food assistance and other support programs. At UC Berkeley on Wednesday, the online queue to access free food opened at 1 p.m. It was full by 1:01 p.m. The pantry also opened another time slot on Mondays.

While basic needs centers are meant as a short-term solution, some students return again and again. Temuujin Sarangerel, a second-year Berkeley City College student studying business administration and finance, stops at his school’s center one or twice a week as one of his main sources of food. 
He and his mom share a CalFresh debit card, and they will have to cut back on meat and other foods if their benefits don’t come in. The prospect makes him “sad and stressed.”
In Los Angeles County, 22-year-old Dante Thomas, a recent graduate of the University of San Francisco, stopped by St. Dominic’s food pantry for the first time. Living now in South Gate, Thomas said he knows how to stretch CalFresh benefits strategically to last the entire month. 
Under the pressure of student debt and keeping up with rent, Thomas said food assistance supports his mental well-being: It’s one less thing to worry about. 
“It’s a little demoralizing as a young person,” he said. “Benefits are being cancelled and I can’t find a consistent role in my career, so things are definitely a little hard right now.”
Preparing for the possibility that CalFresh won’t come through starting Saturday Thomas said he has been even more judicious about what he buys. “I’d go to the store and get a salad or something … and now I don’t even think that’s something that makes sense to do financially,” he said. “It’s very hard.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa’s law putting new regulations on pharmacy benefits managers is temporarily blocked from enforcement for Wellmark Blue Cross-Blue Shield health plans and insurance policies.
Chief U.S. District Judge Stephanie Rose issued a temporary injunction Wednesday in the case, brought earlier this month by Iowa’s largest health insurer against the state insurance commissioner. The case challenges enforcement of Senate File 383, the measure signed into law in June that regulates certain business practices by PBMs, the entities negotiating prescription drug costs between manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies.
The law restricts PBMs’ ability to set certain cost-sharing rates, fees, or other financial means to incentivize a person to fill their prescription at a certain pharmacy. It also requires independent pharmacies to be reimbursed at the average national acquisition cost of a drug plus a $10.68 dispensing fee.

The law was supported by many advocates and business owners of small and rural pharmacies. Pharmacists and some health care advocates said the PBM practices targeted by the Iowa law contributed to the closure of more than 200 rural and independent pharmacies across the state, including 31 pharmacies that closed in 2024.
But business leaders and health insurance companies have said the measure will lead to higher health care costs for Iowans. The Iowa Association of Business and Industry warned the measure could result in an additional $340 million in costs for private-sector health insurance plans, resulting in an increase of $169 for the average insured Iowans’ pharmaceutical costs each year.
The Iowa Association of Business and Industry also filed a lawsuit in June to block enforcement of the law. Rose, who also oversaw this case, issued a temporary injunction on July 21 applying to plaintiffs of the ABI lawsuit.
In that decision to issue a temporary injunction, Rose wrote that several parts of the PBM law exceed state authority in regulating health care plans, conflicting with the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. She also found the law could conflict with First Amendment protections for commercial speech “without adequate constitutional justification.”
Wellmark’s October lawsuit referenced Rose’s decision in the ABI case, saying the injunction order brought into question whether Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen can legitimately enforce the state’s PBM law if it conflicts with federal ERISA regulations. The lawsuit specifically pointed to guidance Ommen issued in September that stated he planned to enforce the new law “in its entirety” against entities that are not plaintiffs in the ABI lawsuit.
Rose’s temporary injunction in the Wellmark case pauses the $10.68 dispensing fee for prescriptions filled at pharmacies in Iowa under Wellmark covered plans and policies, including those working through CVS Caremark, the PBM that works with Wellmark.
In a news release on the decision, the company said the preliminary injunction provides benefits like offering “clear compliance guidance” on the law, and shielding more than 1 million Iowans from “significant increases in prescription medication costs” under the law. The company had estimated individuals covered by Wellmark policies would face increased costs of nearly $40 million annually.
The Iowa Insurance Division did not respond a request for comment Friday on the injunction. Provisions of the law not blocked under the court order will continue to be enforced. The temporary injunctions blocking parts of the law, set in the Wellmark and ABI lawsuits, will remain in place until a decision is made on in the cases about the law’s constitutionality.

Public Service Commissioner Annie Bukacek, also a doctor in private practice, is using state equipment to copy medical records unrelated to agency work, a complaint filed this week with the state ethics watchdog alleges.
A photo of Dr. Annie Bukacek (Photo via Annie Bukacek for PSC website).
Bukacek, elected in 2022, declined Friday to address the question and directed the Daily Montanan to the Public Service Commission director.
Public Service Commissioner Brad Molnar filed the complaint, dated Wednesday, with the Commissioner of Political Practices, which monitors and enforces ethical standards for public officers.
In the complaint, Molnar, recently ousted as president, asks the Commissioner of Political Practices to estimate the money Bukacek owes ratepayers for her alleged abuse of state resources and levy penalties accordingly.
Bukacek is a licensed physician based in Kalispell, according to the Montana Board of Medical Examiners. She is on the Logan Health Medical Center receptionist directory.
In the complaint, Molnar said he has observed Bukacek “dragging a valise or an even larger suitcase” into the PSC office building after returning from her home in Kalispell.
At the office, Molnar said he often couldn’t use the copier because Bukacek was using it “for long periods of time.” One night, looking for a document he thought he might have thrown out, Molnar discovered “the first tranche of evidence” under fax cover sheets, the complaint said.
In a phone call, Molnar said the cover sheets largely show correspondence to Logan Health from other medical offices, such as Walmart Pharmacy or the Deer Lodge Medical Center.
“It became obvious the suitcases contained her business documents so she could perform her business functions while at the PSC offices,” the complaint said.
Until last week, Molnar served as president of the Public Service Commission. The PSC regulates public utilities and has five commissioners elected by district.
Molnar was ousted as president after his colleagues alleged he repeatedly interfered with an internal investigation into professional misconduct, and the PSC needed a reset.
Molnar himself announced the investigation in July and has admitted only to being unpolished.
Molnar said he was still president when he first discovered the medical printouts sometime the first week of April.
“I’ve got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these,” Molnar said.
He said he didn’t want bad publicity under his watch, and Bukacek had refused to talk with him, so he asked Commissioner Jennifer Fielder, vice president, to talk with her.
But he said Bukacek continued the practice.
In a phone call, Fielder said she recalls Molnar pointing out “a stack of trash” to her, but she believed Bukacek had been cleaning out her office.
Fielder said she doesn’t recall asking Bukacek directly about whether she was using state equipment for personal business, but she has in general offered that guidance to all her colleagues.
Fielder also said Molnar himself was free to talk with Bukacek himself or send her an email.
In state law, rules of conduct for officers state that they may not “use public time, facilities, equipment, state letterhead, supplies, personnel, or funds for the officer’s or employee’s private business purposes.”
Molnar himself was found to have violated that ethics law multiple times by using public facilities and equipment in his first stretch as a member of the Public Service Commissioner, according to a 2010 decision by the Commissioner of Political Practices.
In the current complaint, Molnar said Bukacek “dragging her bags of business documents has diminished” since the legislative session adjourned.
However, Bukacek still “uses the copy rooms exponentially far more often than I,” even though as president, Molnar said he needed more copies than most commissioners on most days, the complaint said.
“Apparently, she’s short on toner where she works,” Molnar said.
Molnar said “it’s not like I’m a dumpster diver,” but the bins can be overflowing with cover sheets, and he has collected a stack of them that’s as thick as a ream of paper.
Just a couple of days ago, Molnar said he went to throw away some bad copies, but the waste basket was overflowing, and he realized it had more medical facility cover sheets.
He said he believes Bukacek is copying the records, tossing out the cover sheets, and keeping many more pages of documents that are printed with them — on state equipment and taxpayer time, he said.
“You can hear the printing machines whirring for a frickin’ hour in there,” Molnar said.
He said he believes some of the documents include private patient information, potentially in violation of HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, because some cover sheets state, “Confidential,” and some include prescription information or reference EKGs, for example.
In response to a voicemail requesting comment, Bukacek sent a text message directing the Daily Montanan to the PSC executive director.
Bukacek did not answer a follow-up text message asking if she used equipment in the PSC office for private medical business.
Fielder, however, said she believes Molnar is disgruntled with his ouster, and the allegations against Bukacek are motivated by his dissatisfaction.
“I think Commissioner Molnar has started trying to besmirch other members of the commission and the department who don’t necessarily go along with his views, particularly related to his removal from office and his conduct,” Fielder said.
The internal investigation into Molnar is pending, as is a request Fielder made to Gov. Greg Gianforte on behalf of an internal “response team” to temporarily suspend Molnar, alleging interference with the investigation.

Molnar has argued he has only availed himself of his free speech rights in speaking out about the allegations.
His lawyer argued Molnar’s recent demotion made the suspension request to the governor moot, but the response team said he can still be disruptive, including through “media activity.”
In a phone call, Molnar said he volunteered to provide the cover sheets to the Commissioner of Political Practices as evidence, but he was told to hold off at this point in the complaint process.
“When Commissioner Bukacek is at the commission, she is supposed to do commission related work,” the complaint said. “Instead, she is doing personal business-related work.
“Since she is often in the office for only one or two hours per week … she is paid about $2,000 per hour of actual commission core functions and treating her elected position as a side hustle.
“Therefore, the time she spends at the commission working on her personal agendas is an insult to the ratepayers as the time would be far better spent doing her public job.”
Fielder said she believes Bukacek works at her medical practice Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and otherwise, works long hours at the Public Service Commission, as evidenced by her deliberations at public meetings.
“She’s demonstrated that she studies the material, she studies the law, she studies the evidence in the record,” Fielder said.
In a phone call, Commissioner of Political Practices Chris Gallus said he is still conducting an initial evaluation on the complaint, which includes confirming whether his office has authority in the matter.
Gallus said he can request additional information from either the complainant or the respondent, assess whether he or a previous commissioner has issued a decision in a similar case, and then issue a summary decision or proceed to a hearing.

Kelly Ayotte said she is “deeply committed” to pushing for state investments in child care amid ongoing funding obstacles and workforce shortages. 
During a forum on investing in child care Thursday in Manchester, Ayotte told child care advocates, stakeholders, and business owners that despite the “challenging budget environment,” New Hampshire remains committed to the recently expanded Child Care Scholarship Program. The state reported that as of summer more than 5,000 families were enrolled in the program, which is a state-federal partnership.
“There’s so much work to do on this issue,” Ayotte said of child care in general. “It goes hand in hand with our housing issues when it comes to our quality of life here in New Hampshire. I want to be a partner, and I want to work with the ideas that come out of this group.”
While government investments like the scholarship program aim to make child care more affordable, supply does not meet the current demand. Families across the Granite State struggle to enroll in and afford early education and care for their children, and providers are often unable to find the workforce necessary to boost capacity. A New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute study published in January found that between 2019 and 2023, the state was short of an average of more than 9,000 child care slots annually.
Ayotte said it is “exciting” that more Granite Staters are using the scholarship program, and that she will continue working with the Department of Health and Human Services to keep the program funded. 
She said that while the state tries to improve the workforce pipeline through its education system, she is also looking to expand incentives for businesses and nonprofits to invest in child care. 
“We need everyone at the table to bring more affordable child care options to our state,” Ayotte said. “Together, we’ll make sure New Hampshire stays the best place to raise a family.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ayottechildcare-1024x610.jpg,,,2025-10-31 14:16:32.345056

Like many parents, dropping off her children there in the mornings allows her to keep her job as a human resources worker. She trusts the teachers, and the kids have made friends. And, equally as important, she can afford it.
But, at pickup time on Tuesday, a daycare staff member handed her a letter informing her that Salt Lake County’s daycare programs had been terminated, scheduled to shut down at the end of the year.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“That was the first I had heard of it. The staff seemed also in shock about it. I mean, everyone seemed very emotional and in shock,” Walker said. “We had received no prior notice, anything, that this was even up for debate.”
That notification came through just hours after the Republican-majority Salt Lake County Council voted 5-4 to end the $2 million annual subsidy that kept four centers, mostly located on the west side of Salt Lake County, afloat.   
Why did the Council shut the program down?
Council member Aimee Winder Newton led a presentation during the Tuesday council meeting arguing that the county isn’t legally mandated to provide daycare — but it’s also not its role. Those who need help affording these services, she said, can apply to the Utah Department of Workforce Services’ child care stipend. 
Quoting a report the county commissioned earlier this year that evaluated the child care programs in the county, Winder Newton said, “the programs face mounting operational and financial challenges. Each center operates with limited coordination, leading to inconsistencies in staffing, budgeting and service delivery.”
Rates in county-sponsored centers are 50% to 60% below market averages, she added, which forces the county to subsidize $2 million a year for about 270 children. 
“I know sometimes it feels nice when you can try to help other people, but we’re not being equitable in how we’re helping people with this program,” she said. “We’ve got $6,000 to $10,000 a child subsidy that we’re giving, and it’s not helping enough kids in the valley.”
Childcare Service Analysis Salt Lake County Division of Parks & Recreation 10.29.25
Monthly rates for the program are about $200 per child, depending on ages. Walker, for example, pays $1,014 a month for her three kids aged 11, 8 and 5. Other programs she has considered would be at least twice that amount in the school year, and even more during the summer. 
“I don’t see a way that we can afford it. To be honest, it’s not even ‘it’ll be tight, but we can make it work.’ We don’t have double the budget for daycare, and to also be able to afford groceries and things like that that are also getting more expensive,” Walker said.
With a two-month notice, she doesn’t have much time to save up for it either. She worries many parents are in her position and will have to forgo child care altogether.
Dozens of parents are organizing online to take action, contacting their council members and planning to attend next council meeting on Tuesday.
“I just want people to know that they’re affecting real families and real people, that we’re not just a list of names in a center, that we are real families, and this will impact us all very negatively, and we were not given a voice in this decision at any point, or any heads up that it was even up for debate,” Walker said. “So I think we just want to make sure that we’re heard.”
‘It’s mean’
The news of the termination shocked and disappointed Utah Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, who has advocated for more child care resources in the state. She said she’s actively working to find solutions to help the affected families.
Utah won’t expand child care access this year

“At the very moment families are losing SNAP benefits and working longer hours just to feed their children, the council’s recommendation to eliminate childcare options creates even greater barriers for working families trying simply to survive,” Escamilla said in a statement.
She added that suggesting families find other providers ignores that neighboring nonprofit providers have month-long wait lists, and they may not offer the same services.
“These centers offered more than supervision; they provided quality, affordable care with wraparound supports like transportation and meal services,” Escamilla said. “Expecting parents to find comparable care within a month is not just unrealistic, it’s mean.”
For-profit centers say they can fill the gap
Johnny Anderson, a Utah Private Child Care Association board member and president of Great Beginnings Academy — which owns nine daycare centers in the county — told the council that licensed child care centers are between 50% and 60% occupancy in the area, and they have plenty of space for any family looking to fill the gap the termination will leave.
He also highlighted that for-profit child care centers are struggling after taking several hits — first when the state implemented full-day kindergarten, and then when unlicensed home providers were allowed to have eight unrelated children in the home. 
“Those of us that are in the for-profit child care business, we are paying property taxes to this county to fund county services, and of course, the county is running child care programs that compete with us,” he said. “So I think that’s worth pointing out and recognizing, as you deliberate this with that.”



Let us know what you think...


 


However, Democratic council members expressed concern about the affordability dilemma families are about to face. 
Council member Jiro Johnson said that while for-profit child care centers have the capacity to fill the gap, they aren’t really available to families that can’t afford them. 
The decision also comes at the same time county leaders have proposed a nearly 20% tax property tax increase, which has drawn criticism across the valley.
Even if the state-sponsored stipend covers most of the bill for families switching child care centers, some of them may still not be able to cover even a $100 or $200 monthly increase in daycare bills.
“If we’re getting so much heat about $88 for the average family household per year,” Johnson said about the volume of public comments on the proposed tax increase, “imagine what that means to a family who now has to make similar payments per month to get child care, which may be absolutely necessary for that family to survive.”

But all the county’s voters have one choice to make Tuesday: who will be the next coroner.
The race hasn’t been competitive in over two decades. But this year, six candidates from different sectors of the emergency services and death care fields are vying to be the county’s next chief death investigator. The pay is $900 per month with an additional $185 per case, according to the current office holder.
Coroners are called to car wrecks and murder scenes, and wherever else a death has occurred that may be natural, sudden, unexpected or unnatural. They determine the cause and manner of death. They are also responsible for keeping records of death investigations for the last five years and coordinating with the state medical examiner’s office during investigations.
Coroners must make “reasonable efforts” to notify next-of-kin. At least seven Hinds County residents were buried without adequately notifying relatives from 2022 to 2023. Most families believed their loved ones were missing until they learned of their burial in a pauper field behind Raymond Detention Center. Hinds County Coroner Sharon Grisham-Stewart later admitted she struggled to find relatives of missing people. She retired soon after in December 2024. 
Jeramiah Howard, her chief deputy for five years, is interim/acting coroner and, along with five other candidates, is running to finish the last two years of  her four-year term.
Candidates must be at least 21, have a high school diploma or its equivalent and be eligible to vote. Only a handful of states have fewer prerequisites to become a coroner. Louisiana, Kansas, Ohio and North Dakota alone require that a coroner in most of their parishes or counties have a medical degree. 
Coroners must attend the Mississippi Forensics Laboratory and State Medical Examiner Death Investigation Training School upon election. Mississippi law mandates ongoing training by the state medical examiner’s office on specimen collection and locating next-of-kin every four years along with 24 hours of continuing education each year.
Most candidates in this election have worked crime scenes in some capacity. The candidate pool includes those who have done work in the private and public sector. All are Hinds County natives, though they’ve lived in other states and counties.

Crystal Houson has worked in law enforcement the last 22 years, including stints at the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department and Jackson State University. She got her start in community policing, getting to know repeat offenders and the neighborhood families. She spent four years as captain in the Warrants Division.
She said her work as both a patrol captain and a public information officer taught her the importance of record management and how to preserve and organize evidence. She also took an advanced course in death investigation to aid her on visits to crime scenes.
“Throughout my career, I have investigated numerous deaths, crime scenes, and traumatic incidents — developing the skills necessary to determine facts accurately and without bias,” she wrote in a statement to Mississippi Today.
She said she wants to restore trust and integrity to the office and would strive to be accountable to the public if elected. Her goal would be to speed up the process of identifying next of kin and to provide more regular updates to grieving families on the status of autopsies. Finding families spread across the county was once part of her job.
She plans to lobby the Hinds County Board of Supervisors to approve the burial of more unclaimed bodies to address a backlog. She would allow families without an initial preference for a funeral home to keep loved ones stored at the morgue while they research options.
She has canvassed the community as a patrol officer.
“I believe that this role is not simply a position of duty; it is a profound commitment to assisting families during some of the most challenging times in their lives,” she said.

Jeramiah Howard joined the Pocahontas Volunteer Fire Department after a tree took out his electricity and the volunteer fire chief arrived to help and proceeded to recruit him.
“If you get my power on, I promise I’ll be at the next meeting,” Howard told him.
He’s been with the department 17 years, including 10 as fire chief. He lives in a home in Pocahontas.
“I don’t want to be the president or the governor or anything at all,” Howard told Mississippi Today. “I want people to genuinely remember me as a good dude. If I could do good, I stop and help. That’s always been my MO.”
TV shows such as “ER” got him interested in becoming a paramedic when he enrolled at Holmes Community College. He enjoyed learning about how even obscure illnesses can alter the human body.
The job had him entering homes engulfed in flames in search of pets and family heirlooms, and prying victims from wrecked cars. It was a departure from his day job as a project manager for a government contractor. He enjoyed helping his regulars like a woman who was prone to falls and often required help getting up.
For many years in the coroner’s office, he operated with only the White Pages and Google to identify family members of the deceased. It was challenging when the deceased had lost touch with family or come from a fractured one. He also had to remove the bodies of those abandoned at funeral homes by financially struggling families.
Howard’s latest initiative is to secure similar databases used by law enforcement to aid in body identification and next-of-kin notification. He depends on technology afforded the Capitol Police to provide fingerprint identification to bodies. Otherwise, if a death occurred on a Friday evening, he would have to wait until Monday for results from an ink fingerprint scan. 
Howard has knocked on hundreds of doors to notify families of dead relatives. He has been on hours-long group calls with grieving relatives.
“You never think you can find the right words to say,” he said. “Everyone takes death differently. I am always happy to tell the relatives everything I know.”
His job involves difficult decisions made on little sleep. He says he once got a call from hospital staff that needed help identifying a grandmother’s relatives. They were close to “pulling the plug,” he said. He visited every address listed for the woman’s relatives in central Mississippi, and eventually found next of kin. The grandmother spent her last three hours with her grandchildren. 
He also dissuaded a mother from visiting the morgue where her daughter was transported after a car wreck on the interstate.
Howard said he aims to improve transparency surrounding pending investigations and departmental shortcomings. If elected, he hopes to procure a backgrounding database and a contractor to renovate the county morgue. His goal is to be the “gold standard” for death investigation in the state, and rebuild trust with Hinds County residents.
“The ones for whom this race means something are those who have felt loss.”

Stephanie Meachum was office manager for the Hinds County Coroner’s Office from 2005 until 2016. The job taught her how to organize agency records and log bodies. She sometimes had to fill in as a deputy coroner and collect information from a crime scene as part of investigations. She also set the office budget.
She has run the death division at the state Department of Health’s vital statistics office since 2016. In this role, she coordinates with coroners across the state and ensures death certificates are issued on time and filled out properly. She regularly phones funeral home directors, nursing homes and other stakeholders that may not understand the paperwork required for death registration. She also regularly speaks with the state Crime Lab, ensuring that deaths resulting from domestic violence and drug abuse are correctly labeled. 
“The job is basically understanding what you’re seeing and reading, and answering the questions to the best that you can,” Meachum said.
In her current job, she has observed that Hinds County, even considering its larger intake of bodies in relation to other counties, lags in processing  death certificates. 
As coroner, she said she would strive to make people more aware of crime victim services. She also envisions the role as more of a presence in the community, traveling to ensure that families have a plan during hurricane season.
“I feel like I’m much more qualified because I have done every aspect of the coroner’s office,” Meachum said. “I’m not learning what to do. I’m coming in with over 20 years of death investigation experience. I’ve been on the on-the-street investigation side. I’ve done hospital calls. I’ve been through mass fatalities and mass disasters.”
She would like more candidates to speak about what occurred in 2021 when the coroner’s office caught heat for its next-of-kin notification policy. She believes the office should be more transparent about its shortcomings, providing regular updates on social media and at forums.
When she worked as office manager for the Hinds County coroner, deputy coroners sometimes had an uneven distribution of work, which Meachum said contributed to a case backlog. She also grew frustrated with deputy coroners who relied on email and fax to ensure important records were shared, when the people could’ve just dropped the paperwork in-person. 
“I’m not just a person who’s going to come out and declare someone deceased without doing the investigative work,” she said.

Schwanna Roberts has worked in funeral homes since she was 17. She was so young that her mother had to sign a release form before she could start. She was initially an embalmer but for the past decade has worked as a funeral home director in Jackson and Chicago.
She remembers when she first got interested in the death care industry. She was attending the wake of her grandmother’s husband and was put off by the embalming work. His skin was discolored, and his body was poorly positioned in the casket. She vowed to her grandmother that she could do a better job. 
Her grandmother continued to take her to funerals for inspiration. Her favorite part of a funeral is the two-minute remarks given by family at the end to “lighten the mood.” 
Roberts became the grief counselor soon after she started working at the funeral home. She said supervisors and colleagues have praised her clear and calming presence.
She hopes to establish a family liaison role within the office to provide “a single, compassionate point of contact during difficult times.” Another priority is establishing protocols to ensure families receive timely updates with empathy and respect.
“The coroner needs to be someone who is for the people,” Roberts said. “You need someone who can tell the truth. You need someone that has great character.” 
When her brother died seven years ago, she couldn’t speak his name without crying. The experience, more than over a decade of funeral home work, made her realize how critical clear communication and a dedicated staff can be for mourners. She started Doves of Peace Ministry to cater the meal after the funeral for two grieving families each month. During difficult times, the 38-year old mother of one daughter said she leans on her family and her faith.
“The main thing is to have someone with a heart in that position,” Roberts said. “Trust has been broken. When there isn’t a communication breakdown or outdated procedures, families aren’t frustrated.”
Her campaign flyer reads: “for the families no one’s checking on, for the families still waiting for answers.” She said she regularly calls random Hinds County numbers in the White Pages as part of campaigning and knocks on dozens of doors.
“There will be no growth if the wrong person is elected,” she said. “I don’t have big plans of wanting a state-of-the-art facility. We should be focused on the basics like identifying and contacting families”

Davista Tillman has wanted to be coroner since she was in fourth grade. Grisham-Stewart spoke to her classroom for career day at Wells Power APAC. She was only 10 years old, but was inspired to see a woman in a county position.
“I told myself I was going to put in some work until that time comes,” Tillman told Mississippi Today.
After graduating from Lanier High School in Jackson, she attended mortuary school where she obtained certificates in mortuary science and funeral services. She later obtained her license as both an embalmer and funeral director. She received her associate degree in criminal justice from Holmes Community College. 
Tillman began her career as an orderly in the adult emergency department at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, the only Level 1 trauma center in the state. She later became an autopsy technician, assisting the pathologist in thorough examinations.
She worked as a funeral director in Jackson and around the state. She currently works as a funeral home director/coroner liaison and post-mortem anatomical donation technician for the Mississippi Organ Recovery Agency. Once a body comes in, she removes, preserves and transports tissue to be used in some cases for what she calls “life-improving surgery.”
“When doing this for so long, you as a person can become numb to death,” Tillman said. “It has also taught me to be more delicate with people’s feelings. Most people’s emotions are all over the place. You learn not to take it to heart when families lash out at you. You become their support in their hardest days.”
She is always on call as a technician for MORA and for the funeral home. She sometimes comes in to work at 10 p.m. or 2 a.m. Her schedule is already similar to that of the coroner and coroner’s deputies, she said. 
“My life experience has given me the knowledge to succeed in this role,” she said. “When I worked as an autopsy technician, you would see the difference between a heart attack and other ailments on the body. Seeing homicides as an embalmer, you see entrance and exit wounds and learn to look for the ligature marks.”
She would make renovating the county morgue a priority. She also envisions an opportunity for mortuary students to embalm bodies that spend excess time at the morgue. If she is going to be the face that parents see on the worst day of their lives, she wants to be more active in the community to offset that shock.

Bryan White joined the candidate forum hosted by the Hinds County Democratic Party Executive Committee on Thursday. Dressed in an emergency services uniform, White wanted attendees to know that he was not a “career politician.”
He reminded candidates that he had a law enforcement background, which he deemed important given Hinds County’s high crime rate.
He envisioned an app that would track the progress of death certificates for loved ones. He expressed a desire to work closer with the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department. If elected, he said he would track homeless people through a database.
The pauper burial controversy was a reminder of how many homeless people live in Jackson, he said.
While on a wellness check, he said he solved a difficult case by determining a deceased person died of carbon monoxide poisoning. He identified a nearby lawn mower as the problem. The mower had recently run out of gas.
“You have to look for the smoking gun,” he said.
White is no longer in law enforcement. He works with emergency services in the county.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30220848/Coroner-candidates-1.jpg,,,2025-10-31 14:02:34.575980

The verdict is in: Idaho ranks 14th and Washington ranks 37th when lining up the most religious states in the nation.
How the Pew Research Center got the results is straightforward: it judged a state’s religiosity based on residents’ answers to four questions on a survey. The reasons leading to a state’s place in the list are a lot harder to conclusively determine. In fact, it’s mostly guesswork, sociologists said.
“One of the things is, when you have descriptive data like this, you can really only start to create hypotheses,” Mark Killian, Whitworth University sociology professor who studies religion, said.
Sociologists of religion have some theories, though: the historic presence of certain religious groups, political migration and a state’s laws and regulations.
The most mentioned theory was the role of migration due to political beliefs and its connection to religion.
One reason people choose to move to other states is due to an alignment between an individual’s political beliefs and the state’s political leaning, Killian said. Because politics are becoming increasingly correlated with and tied to religious identity, migration due to politics turns into migration due to religion, he added.
Pew’s 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study found that 61% of those who have a high level of religiousness tend to lean Republican compared to 32% who lean Democrat. Eight percent had no leaning.
The study also found that 67% of people who have a low level of religiousness lean Democrat compared to 27% who lean Republican. Five percent had no leaning.
Over the past decade, Scott Draper, College of Idaho anthropology and sociology professor who studies religion, said people have increasingly been identifying as both Republicans and conservative/evangelical Protestants.
The connection between both identities could go back even further than that, Killian said. Prior to the mid-20th century, he said that evangelicals had a variety of political leanings or were nonpartisan. Then some people, most notably American pastor and televangelist Jerry Falwell,  worked to merge religious identification with specific political stances — especially the pro-life movement.
“Up until that point, a lot of evangelicals weren’t necessarily pro-choice, but there was no pro-life movement” in evangelicalism, Killian said, because the pro-life movement was primarily Catholic and evangelicals wanted to keep themselves ideologically separate.
Then, Killian said, Falwell worked to consolidate political power by commingling religious views with certain political stances, primarily abortion and sexuality.
“All that to say, now three generations later, we have those reverberations and these worldviews have spun off,” he said. “There’s some who think you cannot think of faith apart from your politics.”
 How evangelicals merged faith and politics

Political identification and its correlation with belief systems, or the lack thereof, seems to go both ways. Desiree Brunette, a Boise State University sociology lecturer who studies religion, said liberal people tend to be less religious. That trend could explain why Washington, a liberal state, ranks low overall on religiosity in Pew’s study.
The Religious Landscape Study judged the “overall religiousness” of people through a combination of four factors: prayer frequency, belief in God or a universal spirit, religion’s importance to people’s lives and religious attendance. It determined that 37% of people in Idaho are highly religious compared to 25% of people in Washington.
Determining the religiosity of a state can also change based on how it is measured. Draper said the study measured overall religiosity pretty reasonably, but that many sociologists of religion determine people’s religious commitment based on frequency of religious attendance.
“People can talk about what they believe or how strongly they feel or think something,” Draper said. “It’s the actual behavior – are you actually going to church?”
The percentage of people who attend religious services at least monthly tells a similar story for Washington, which also ranks 37th in the nation with 27% of people attending religious services at least monthly. The alternative idea of religiosity changes Idaho’s line in the list slightly, moving up to 11th in the nation with 40% of people attending religious services at least monthly.
No matter how it is measured, sociologists said the connection between politics and religion and the migration of people based on partisan ideologies could be driving the levels of religiousness in each state.
Californians migrating to Idaho is an example. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that, in 2023, almost 82,000 people moved from another state to Idaho, and over 20% of those people, the largest percentage of any state, came from California.
Anecdotally, Draper said conservative Idaho residents often despair about the in-migration of Californians due to perceptions of conflicting political views.
“I often want to point out that I think those Californians are probably a little more conservative than you think,” Draper said. “It’s geographical sorting based on partisanship.”
“Now, this is very hypothetical,” Draper said, adding that he didn’t think people were moving in between states solely due to religious views.
 
Lasting influence of the ‘Mormon Corridor’

Past migrations of religious groups and their continued presence in a state could also influence the state’s religious ranking, Draper said.
Idaho and Utah both tend to be pretty religious when compared to other western states, which Draper said might be due to the influence of Latter-day Saints, who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “They’re instrumental in our state, for religious identity,” Draper said.
Driven by a desire for religious freedom, Latter-day Saints began migrating beyond the borders of the United States in the mid-1800s, looking for a place with a low population, and settling primarily in Utah and the surrounding area, now known as the “Mormon Corridor.”
When Brunette moved to the state 20 years ago, she said she noticed how many laws seemed tied to religious views — things like not being able to buy liquor on Sundays in some places, the near-total abortion ban and the faith-healing exemption to child abuse and neglect laws.
“That felt really informed from the Latter-day Saints population, ” Brunette said.
The religious-based laws in Idaho seem to be based on a Christian worldview rather than other religious belief systems, Brunette said. For example, abortion bans are widely viewed as a violation of Jewish religious freedom, she added.
Differences in the religious ranking of states could be tied to these types of laws and views on religious freedom, which tend to attract certain religious communities, Brunette said.
“There’s more protections here for people that might be considered a little fringy,” she said, mentioning fundamentalist groups like the Followers of Christ. “That would be my guess.”
The study’s data gets more granular, and the findings indicate potential trends in the way people engage with and experience religion in their lives.
In Washington, 30% of people say religion is very important in their lives compared to 45% in Idaho. Only eight states had 50% or more of people who said religion was very important in their lives.
Although religion can often be seen as very important to people and influencing their political reasoning and discussions, Draper said it was interesting that most people weren’t ranking it as very important in their lives.
Although not directly comparable due to changes in how the survey was conducted, Pew’s data found that the amount of people who say religion is very important in their lives is dropping.
In 2007, 58% of adults in Idaho said religion is very important in their lives, compared to 51% in 2014 and 45% in 2023-24.

The decline is true for Washington, as well. In 2007, 48% of adults in the state said religion is very important in their lives compared to 44% in 2014 and 30% in 2023-24.

The decline of religion’s importance directly conflicts with the rise in people’s perception of religion’s importance in American life.
According to Pew, people’s perception of whether religion is gaining influence in American life jumped up significantly in 2025, although 68% of people still feel it is losing influence.

Just like overall religious trends, it’s all guesswork on why religion is seen to be gaining influence in American life, while fewer people are ranking it as very important to them.
Brunette speculated that the people influencing politics are both the most religious and have the loudest voices. Killian said his hunch is that people aren’t ranking religion as very important in their lives because they’re replacing it with politics.
“Religion becomes less important because politics is religion for some people now in these conservative states,” Killian said. There are others who ascribe to religion who view the uplifting of political views based on Christianity as a form of idolatry, he added.
 Evangelical growth as mainline churches shrink

The breakdown of people who ascribed to certain religions in 2023-24 and its comparison to previous Religious Landscape Studies also reveals trends in religious demographics.
In Idaho, Draper pointed out that Catholics and mainline Protestants have dropped from 18% and 16% respectively in 2007 to 9% and 7% respectively in 2023-24.
At the same time, evangelical Protestants increased in the state from 22% in 2007 to 31% in 2023-24.
Latter-day Saints have also declined in Idaho, from 23% in 2007 to 14% in 2023-24, despite the way Draper said they have “historically characterized my state.”
The drop could be due to the outmigration of Latter-day Saints, or attrition, Killian said.
Washington has seen drops in identification with Christian religious sects and some growth in populations of “other religions,” but Draper said the most notable change for him was the increase in people identifying as religiously unaffiliated, often called “nones” because they believe in nothing in particular.
In 2007, 23% of surveyed Washington residents identified as religiously unaffiliated compared to 38% in 2023-24.
“I’m really struck by that,” Draper said. “That’s really high.”
There are often a lot of reasons nones could be growing, Draper said, adding that how the groups are measured or whether people understand their own affiliation can affect the data. He said the Pew Research Center’s data tends to be reliable.
The growth of nones can be hypothesized to be tied to politics, Draper said. Other sociology of religion scholars have proposed that people are disaffiliating from specific religious groups because of how the religion is becoming associated with politics, he added.
“A lot of younger people who grew up in evangelical Protestant families, they become sort of disgusted with their family’s politics and they might back away entirely from religion and might identify less strongly, and might prefer a different term,” Draper said. “They might be devout still, but not want to identify.”
The growth of nones in Washington could also be tied to partisan geographical sorting, Draper said.
At the end of the day, the sociologists said interpreting the data is all speculation.
“There are so many different layers to this,” Killian said.

Wade Andrew Robinson of rural Madison County, running against board President Kevin Halterman of Indianola for the board’s fourth-district seat, was arrested at 7:47 p.m. Oct. 30 and charged with extortion with the intent to expose to ridicule, hatred or contempt, according to inmate booking information from the county. Extortion is a class D felony in Iowa.

Halterman said in an interview he filed a complaint against Robinson with the sheriff’s department regarding alleged election violations, but declined to discuss details of the complaint. He also requested a no contact order against Robinson, according to Warren County court documents.
Robinson was released on $5,000 bond and is scheduled for an initial court appearance on Nov. 12. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Warren County Attorney Douglas Eichholz said he had no comment.
According to the affidavit included in court records, Halterman reported to the Warren County Sheriff’s Office that he had received an email from Robinson on Aug. 14 in which Robinson allegedly requested a “release settlement and non-disclosure agreement” and $1 million. On Aug. 20, according to the affidavit, Robinson emailed again, telling Halterman “he was planning to run for District 4 Board Seat and was going to start things that weekend.” In order to have his name in consideration for the seat, Robinson needed to have his election paperwork submitted by Aug. 25.
Robinson allegedly said in his email to Halterman he would “hold off” on launching a run for the seat if Halterman agreed to his wishes, according to the affidavit.
“It is believed Wade Robinson is extorting the victim to agree to the money request and he won’t run for the board seat,” the affidavit stated.
Robinson previously served as dean of Student Resources and Ankeny Student Success at DMACC, and has filed complaints against the college and others connected to it for alleged Title IX violations and retaliation against him as a whistleblower. He also accused former board president Joe Pugel and DMACC President Rob Denson of having mishandled university resources in a past election.
Elections for the seat, which covers the Carlisle, Indianola, Interstate 35, Martensdale-St Marys, Melcher-Dallas, Norwalk, Pleasantville, Southeast Warren, Van Meter and Winterset school districts and part of Waukee, will take place Nov. 4.

Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, speaks Friday, April 12, 2024, on Senate Bill 187, the capital budget. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, will resign from the Alaska Senate on Monday, according to a resignation letter submitted to Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak.
The resignation was expected. Shower was named the lieutenant governor candidate for Republican gubernatorial candidate Bernadette Wilson in September, and he said he would resign from his seat early.
Shower did not immediately respond to a phone call and text messages seeking comment on Thursday afternoon.
Under Alaska law and Republican Party rules, party officials in Shower’s district will nominate possible replacements to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who will select the replacement. 
It’s a process Dunleavy will be familiar with: Before being elected governor in 2018, Dunleavy served in the Senate and resigned early to focus on his election. Then-Gov. Bill Walker nominated Mike Shower to fill Dunleavy’s seat and Shower went on to win the next election in his own right.
Shower’s possible replacements must be Republicans, because Shower is a Republican, and otherwise meet the Alaska Constitution’s requirements for office.
The governor’s selection must be confirmed by the Senate’s other Republicans before being seated. That includes the other five Republicans in the Senate’s six-person minority caucus, as well as the five Republicans in the bipartisan Senate majority caucus.
Confirmation isn’t guaranteed: In 2018, Republican senators rejected Walker’s first choice to replace Dunleavy. Walker’s second choice withdrew his name from consideration. 
In 2019, Republicans rejected Dunleavy’s first choice to replace Anchorage Republican Sen. Chris Birch, who died in office.
Each of Alaska’s state senate districts consists of two House districts. Reps. George Rauscher, R-Sutton, and Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, respectively represent each of the House districts within Shower’s Senate district, and both men said they will be putting their names forward for consideration.
Rauscher had already announced his intention to seek Shower’s seat in the 2026 election.
It was not immediately clear on Thursday if additional candidates would be proposed for consideration by party officials.
If either Rauscher or McCabe are chosen, it would set off a domino effect: Dunleavy would then be able to select a new House representative to replace the person who moved to the Senate.
Sen. Robert Myers, R-North Pole, said he believes Shower has been talking to Dunleavy about possible options.
“I think the expectation at this point is Rep. Rauscher, but I don’t want to weigh in any further than that,” Myers said of his preference.
Myers said the resignation makes sense. 
“Honestly, it makes some relationships a little bit awkward if you’re still in the Legislature while running for a statewide seat like that. It could have potentially complicated next year’s session a little bit,” he said. “I wish him well on what he embarks on for the future, whether that’s politically or personally.”
While the Senate minority caucus will now need to pick a new leader, Myers said he doesn’t expect the next legislative year will have other significant changes because there’s someone new in Shower’s seat.
“The (senate) majority has already laid out what their priorities are,” he said. “I don’t see votes changing, numbers changing, majority-minority votes on major bills, or anything like that.”
At least one more Senate resignation is expected soon. Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, is running for governor and has said she will resign in time for a replacement to be selected before the legislative session begins in January.
“I typically put in about 40 hours of work, even during the interim, 40 hours or more. And so, juggling that along with the governor electoral campaign is tricky, but there’s certain things I want to finish up and make sure I’m leaving things in good order as I pass out of the district,” she said.
At the same time, she wants to leave time for Dunleavy to pick both her replacement and a replacement for a House member if he selects either Reps. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, or DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, to replace her.
Tilton has already filed to run for Senate in 2026. 
Hughes said that regardless of the replacement, she doesn’t think the Senate will change significantly. She also said that she’s going to stay out of the discussion of who will replace Shower as Senate Minority Leader.
“That’s up to that group to decide,” she said. “I’m not going to be one of them. I’m not going to meddle and try to tell them who should or should not be Senate Minority Leader.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/240412-Mike-Shower-copy-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-10-31 14:02:34.575980

(Photo by Rosanne Skirble for Maryland Matters)Lincoln Smith’s food forest is next to a gas station and a church off a highway in Bowie.
Smith says his mission as the director of Forested is to rewild this former cornfield, stripped in the course of Maryland’s agricultural history of its trees, its soil depleted and biodiversity drained by industrialized single-crop food production.
“We’re trying to restore [the] forest and produce food for people in a forested agroecosystem,” he said.
When he rented 10 acres from the neighboring church in 2012, the first thing Smith did was to take note of what was already there. Luck would have it that a stand of mature native trees formed a natural border, and beneath their canopy were wild black raspberry bushes and persimmon trees, whose seeds were spread into the field by wildlife that ate the fruit.
Now, on this fall day, Smith and crew harvest those persimmons, plus other native and nonnative fruits and berries from the bushes, gardens and trees that cover the landscape.
“We have over 100 species that we’ve planted, as well as many species that we didn’t plant, that are wild and that we’ve allowed to come in and grow here,” Smith said.
“We grow in layers,” he said. “We have big trees together with understory-size trees and shrubs and vines and patches of vegetables, and native flowers to support beneficial insects and habitat for the birds that eat those insects.”

Smith says that as the forest grows, people come, just to walk around, pick its fruits and attend workshops and other events like the twice-yearly Forest Feast, a multicourse, forest-to-table chef meal.
“[This fall] we had baklava made from butternuts, chestnuts and hazelnuts and dried persimmons. We had acorn crostini topped with berry jam, imitation crab cake made from a beautiful lion’s mane mushroom together with our hot peppers and herbs, and sweet potatoes seasoned with some of our nuts,” he said.
Growing an urban food forest network
Forested is part of a growing food forest network in the U.S. In Maryland, that includes the Maryland Forest Service and Queen Anne’s County Edible Forest Trail in Centreville, Long Creek Nursery in Frederick, the Reed Center for Ecosystem Reintegration in Middletown, and a food forest behind a Brunswick food bank.
Add to that list the Takoma Park Elementary School, and two sections on the Takoma Park/Silver Spring Montgomery College campus. Those projects are led by Miles Amoore, co-founder of the nonprofit Community Food Forest Collective, and Tierney Acosta, a Montgomery College horticulture student, who leads the college permaculture club.
Over the weekend, both were giving tours at the Community Food Forest Collective Fall Food Festival. The three-quarter-acre college site at the corner of a busy intersection includes broad sections filled with herbs, vegetables, wildflowers, berry bushes, grape vines, hops and nut trees.
Work at the site began in 2023 with 450 cubic yards of leaf moss, wood chips and compost. Amoore says the earth responded with early signs of an emerging diverse ecosystem.
“It turned grass into soil and insects and bees and fungal life came back almost overnight,” he said.
The rest of the food forest, with the exception of a mature stand of oaks and holly trees already there, went in by design, with the help of nearly 500 volunteers, many recruited by  Acosta from her peers at the college, students and friends.

“We’ve planted several thousand plants and over 100 different species found within our watershed,” she said. “Now it is alive and thriving, not only for humans, but for wildlife, and the amazing thing about planting this way in multiple layers is that it really feeds itself, and is really resilient.”
Acosta says the food forest also plants an opportunity.
“It is really just a fun place to connect with your community,” she said. “[This] is a time when we are so polarized, we really wanted a place where you can just come and be who you are.”
Whether that means attending any of the day’s workshops that range from how to make acorn flour, pickle cucumbers, brew Ethiopian coffee, use fig leaves in a range of Turkish dishes or pasta making with freshly picked garden herbs, Amoore says, the food forest can also sow seeds of change.
“It’s about bringing people in relationship to the land and with each other. We want thriving spaces that are hubs for education, gatherings, celebration, ritual and joy,” he said.
Amoore’s vision is to expand food forests into communities and schools across the region.
“These hubs can have a ripple effect by reconnecting people to the land, to each other and to the source of food,” he said.
‘Mother Nature takes care of us’
Smith, trained in landscape design, says, the food forest mimics the structure and function of a natural forest. Unlike the cornfield, its diverse biosystem helps protect it, and keeps it thriving. A diverse population of predatory insects helps control pests.
It’s here that Smith brings clients, including private landowners and municipal officials, to show them how to adapt his ideas to their properties.

“We need to have healthy, thriving ecosystems full of biodiversity and wildlife habitat and water filtration, building soil and sequestering carbon. All that needs to happen in our production lands,” Smith said, adding that each new food forest is a step in that direction.
Smith works with a small paid staff as well as dedicated volunteers who take on multiple tasks year-round, from pruning to planting. On this day, volunteer Jenn Mott is harvesting the last of the hot peppers, among the many chores she’s taken on since January, when she discovered Forested.
She says here she can step outside of her daily work routine into the restorative powers of the forest.
“Mother Nature takes care of us,” she said. “With just a tiny bit of effort, she rewards us and sustains us with so much abundance, not just with food, but also, emotionally and spiritually.”
Arman Milanian agrees. The University of Maryland graduate student is among the longest-serving volunteers, coming regularly for over a decade.
Today he is helping supervise homeschooled children and their parents in removing vines and picking a large haul of sweet potatoes. He says the space pulls him in.
“[It’s] the amount of birds, the amount of insects, the amount of flowers, the amount of food. Those are gifts from Nature,” he said. “[We’ve] invited Nature in, and Nature provides.”

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)The group behind a statewide push to legalize recreational marijuana filed suit against the DeSantis administration Friday for allegedly slow-walking the process to put its proposed amendment on the Florida ballot.
Smart & Safe Florida is hoping the Florida Supreme Court will force the Secretary of State and Director of the Division of Elections to complete the next step in the amendment process: issuing a letter acknowledging that Smart & Safe has enough support for the marijuana amendment to advance.
This is its second lawsuit this month against the election officials.
“It is nonsensical, and contrary to the express constitutional and statutory mandates, to allow the Secretary and Director to indefinitely refuse to issue the…Letter and frustrate the constitutional order,” wrote Tallahassee attorney Glenn Burhans, Jr. in his 25-page request for a writ of mandamus.
He pointed out that Smart & Safe has secured more than three times the number of verified petitions (over 660,000) needed to make it to the ballot, and in August asked Secretary of State Cord Byrd and Division of Elections Director Maria Matthews to issue a letter to the Florida Attorney General confirming that the group has enough verified forms to continue.
But three months later, in an unusual move, the department still hasn’t issued the required letter. This throws the fate of the proposed amendment into a dubious light due to a state law requiring the Florida Supreme Court to sign off on the amendment before April 1, for clarity’s sake. The court can’t do that if Byrd doesn’t submit his letter to the AG, who then can’t ask the court to offer an opinion.
Byrd’s office declined to comment on “pending litigation” to the Phoenix.
‘Withholding the letter’
DeSantis and his allies, including DeSantis-appointed Byrd, have been vehemently opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana in Florida. During the 2024 cycle when Smart & Safe first attempted to legalize the drug with Amendment 3, DeSantis encouraged a multi-million dollar campaign against the proposal.
Alongside his wife, First Lady Casey DeSantis, the two toured the state decrying the drug’s smell and insisting big corporations were trying to write themselves into the constitution. Attorney General James Uthmeier, the governor’s former chief of staff, has come under fire after his political committee to defeat the amendment received millions that originated from a Medicaid settlement doled out to Casey DeSantis’ charity, Hope Florida.
Separate grand juries are now allegedly investigating the DeSantis administration’s role in defeating the 2024 measure and Hope Florida’s shadowy financials.
In his petition, Burhans suggested that Byrd and Matthews may be purposely roadblocking the marijuana amendment by attempting to stall out Smart & Safe’s proposal by both waiting out the clock and ordering county supervisors on Oct. 3 to trash as many as 200,000 signatures — nearly one-quarter of what’s needed to qualify for next year’s ballot — because organizers failed to provide the entire amendment to people it reached out to by mail.
This allegedly “unlawful” move was the basis of Smart & Safe’s Oct. 19 suit against the administration in Circuit Court. Now it’s saying this is part of a larger push to smother the amendment before it gets to the ballot.
DeSantis administration is interfering with new recreational pot amendment, lawsuit alleges

“Respondents appear to be withholding the…Letter on the hopes that the county supervisors’ compliance with the Secretary’s Directive might result in the Petition falling below the statutory threshold,” Burhans wrote. “There is no source of law that grants Respondents this authority.”
This is Smart & Safe’s second attempt to legalize recreational marijuana in Florida. Although its amendment received 56% support in 2024 among Floridians, it wasn’t enough to reach the 60% threshold needed to amend the state constitution.
“The Director did not respond to Smart & Safe’s August 12 letter requesting issuance of the…Letter or explain why the letter had not been issued,” the petition says. “As of the date of this filing…Smart & Safe’s Petition has met the threshold for issuance of the…Letter. The Respondents must therefore be compelled to perform their indisputable legal duty.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/marijuana.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 14:02:34.575980

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)The Virginia Senate on Friday by a 21-16 party-line vote approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would give the Virginia General Assembly the authority to redraw the commonwealth’s congressional districts mid-decade. The move follows the measure’s 51-42 party-line passage earlier this week in the House of Delegates.
If lawmakers approve House Joint Resolution 6007 again during the next legislative session in early 2026 and if voters back it in a statewide referendum, the General Assembly would gain the power — in narrowly defined circumstances — to alter the state’s 11 U.S. House districts between the 2025 and 2030 census cycles

The advertisement of the amendment comes amid a national wave of redistricting fights, with Republican-led states such as Texas, Missouri and North Carolina having recently pursued mid-cycle map changes — a trend Virginia Democrats say threatens to weaken the commonwealth’s leverage and representation in Congress.
The underlying amendment would leave intact the independent redistricting commission created via referendum in 2020, but carve out an “option” for the legislature to act between Jan. 1, 2025 and Oct. 31, 2030 if another state redraws its congressional districts for non-census or non-court-ordered reasons.
 Democrats defend effort as safeguard

The Senate floor debate quickly expanded beyond the procedural question at hand, becoming a broader clash over the future of redistricting in Virginia and nationally. 
Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, who chairs the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, cast the amendment as a safeguard against what he described as a coordinated attempt to weaken democratic systems. 
Rouse said Virginia had already “seen the purge of voting rolls,” efforts to “restrict access to the ballot box,” and bills seeking to limit early voting — all part of a national pattern he tied to President Donald Trump. 
“We do see evidence that the system is being rigged by a wannabe-dictator out of Washington,” he said.
Rouse said Virginians struggling under the effects of the federal shutdown — from unpaid workers to families losing SNAP benefits — “may want to say something about that” in the years ahead, and this amendment simply gives them the choice to respond. 
“What it does not do, it does not eliminate or dissolve the Virginia redistricting commission,” he said. “It is not a mandate, but it gives (voters) a say on how their country is being run, and how their representatives are representing them.”
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said Virginia was confronting a reality voters could not have predicted when they approved the redistricting reform five years ago. He warned that states such as Texas and Missouri were now using mid-cycle redistricting to lock in power, while Virginia remains “unable to fight with one hand tied behind its back.”
“The Republicans doubled down on gerrymandering,” Surovell said, arguing the result would be a decade of congressional dominance even if Democrats won more votes nationwide. “That’s not democracy. It’s not what we signed up for, and it’s not sustainable.” 
He added that in an ideal world, Congress would ban partisan gerrymandering nationwide, but until then, “we can’t allow a certain partisan tyrannical majority to continue to gerrymander itself in a permanent power while we sit around and say our commitment to principle.”
Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, said the amendment was a proportional response to “opportunistic, mid-decade redistricting” now being encouraged by the Trump-Vance administration. 
“We’ve never had a president threaten and strong-arm state governors and legislators for changes to their state’s maps, for partisan games,” he said. “Yet that is exactly what we are seeing now.” 
VanValkenburg argued that what Republicans truly feared was that voters might approve the amendment: “I feel pretty confident that if this thing does go to them, they’re going to pass it. And Donald Trump will have to face the music in 2026.”
 GOP calls move “a power grab” that bypasses voters

Republicans countered that Democrats were misrepresenting the amendment’s reach — and more importantly, its consequences. 
Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, called it “a violation of the public’s trust,” pointing to the amendment’s release date just days before the election. 
“Over a million Virginians have already cast their ballots,” he said, arguing that voters never had a chance to know where candidates stood on the proposal. The move, he said, “completely undermines the intervening election safeguard that our Constitution requires.”
Sturtevant also pointed to the 2020 constitutional amendment, approved by 2.3 million Virginians, which created the redistricting commission and removed lawmakers from the map-drawing process. 
“They said very clearly that politicians should not be drawing the maps,” he said. “Yet this amendment would strip that commission of its authority and give that power back to the very politicians that the voters removed from the process.”

Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, echoed that argument, saying the amendment violated the constitutional requirement that an intervening election must occur before lawmakers can approve a proposed amendment for the second time. 
“That is being violated by virtue of the fact that this election is already underway,” he said, calling the move “a deliberate and clear effort to disenfranchise those million Virginia voters.”
Sen. Danny Diggs, R-York, argued the proposal represented a shift away from fair representation and toward national partisan strategy. 
“It takes the authority to redraw congressional districts away from the independent redistricting commission that the citizens voted to create in 2020,” he said, and “gives it instead to the General Assembly … to use congressional redistricting as a means of manipulating power in Washington.”
Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, accused Democrats of attempting to engineer a 10-1 congressional split in their favor. 
“This is not about options, this is very direct. We don’t care about fair districts, we care about making sure that there will be 10 Democratic congressional seats from Virginia next November. That’s what this vote is,” he said, referring to his colleagues across the aisle. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin blasted the vote in a statement Friday afternoon, calling the entire process “shameful, fundamentally wrong, and illegal.” 
He accused Democrats of pushing the amendment through “in a party-line vote, in an eleventh-hour special session at the tail end of the election,” and said lawmakers did so “with debate silenced, members threatened with removal, and resolutions against political violence shot down.” 
But Democrats rejected the argument that the resolution was a partisan effort, insisting the public would still hold the final say. 
Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, noted that even if lawmakers pass the amendment a second time in 2026, “the same citizens who voted two to one against partisan gerrymandering will still have the final say.” She argued the proposal “in no way takes away any decision-making authority from the public. We’re giving them an option.”
 Senate rejects GOP bid to keep maps with commission

Earlier on Friday, the Senate rejected, by the same 21-16 margin, an amendment offered by Sen. Chris Head, R-Botetourt, that would have instructed the redistricting commission rather than the General Assembly to redraw maps if the HJR 6007 passes. Head contended the commission, rather than legislators, should retain the power if voters approve the amendment.
Surovell pushed back against Head’s proposal by arguing that the redistricting commission was never the impartial body its supporters claimed. 
He said the panel was “not independent,” noting that it was composed of “half legislators, and half people that are picked by legislators.” The structure, he added, was effectively “designed to generate gridlock — which is why the Supreme Court had to draw the maps.”
Virginia currently has an 11-member U.S. House delegation — six Democrats and five Republicans. Some political strategists believe new maps could shift one or more seats toward the Democrats, enhancing the party’s national position, but critics warn it could erode public trust in the fairness of the electoral system.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-31 17:15:40+00:00,CT Mirror,Portraits from Hartford’s Día de Muertos celebration: ‘It is beautiful’,Mariana Navarrete Villegas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/31/hartford-dia-de-muertos-celebration/,"CT Mirror visited Hartford’s celebration of Día de Muertos, or Day of the Dead, where we took photos of attendees and learned what the holiday means to them.","On Saturday, Oct. 18, downtown Hartford’s Pratt Street was filled with orange marigolds, brightly colored tissue paper decorations and children dancing to live Mariachi music with sugary ‘pan de muerto’ in hand.
The occasion marked the beginning of Día de Muertos — Day of the Dead — season around Hartford. This event was organized by Helena’s Casita, a community cultural organization, in collaboration with vintage shop Gentle Bull, the Wadsworth Museum of Art, the Connecticut Science Center and the Connecticut Museum of Culture and History.
The Day of the Dead originated among indigenous peoples in Mexico, who celebrate their ancient ancestors, family members who passed away, and sometimes even pets, on Nov. 1 and 2. Other Central and South American countries have similar traditions such as El Día de los Difuntos in Ecuador and Peru, or El Día de Todos Santos in Guatemala.
Over the years, this tradition gained popularity in the United States as it migrated to this country with its people. In Connecticut, Mexicans are the second-largest Hispanic group, after Puerto Ricans. Nearly half of Hartford’s residents are Hispanic, according to the latest national census.
The Pratt Street celebration was open to all. There were Boricua accents singing Vicente Fernandez songs, and Creole speakers commenting “Kèt!” and “Mezanmi!” as they savored the traditional hot chocolate.
Founder of Helena’s Casita, Helena Delphina, along with other organizers, said she took care to honor the tradition in Hartford with respect, by providing a space for art, culture and memory in downtown.
Delphina, who is of Salvadoran and Mexican descent, organized the first event of its kind in 2022, which she called a “love letter to Hartford.” She didn’t grow up celebrating Día de Muertos, but when her sister Charlie Gonzales died in 2015, her family began honoring her with this tradition. Now the celebration is a more personal and intimate part of her life.
For some Mexican families who attended, this event was pleasantly nostalgic. Some said they might not have celebrated Día de Muertos if it weren’t for these gatherings.

Such was the case of Ana Jimenez, a Mexican woman who has lived in Connecticut for more than 30 years, and convinced her two daughters to accompany her to enjoy the festivities in the city.
“I actually don’t set up an altar here, but I’m left with a longing for the traditions of my country,” Jimenez said. “This event makes me happy because it allows us to teach our children about the traditions and the importance of our deceased loved ones, that we don’t forget them even if we move away, and that they can still be united with the family.”
Jimenez recalled that in her hometown, Xochimilco, her mother would set up the Día de Muertos offering on Oct. 30, while her siblings visited the cemetery for a vigil. During the ceremonies, her mother typically gives out bags with bread, fruit and a sugar skull, which they then distribute to the neighbors.
Although Saturday’s event in Hartford wasn’t the same, Jimenez said she hoped Delphina will do it again next year, and so she can continue to encounter Mexican traditions on the street — and other Latinos in the city who celebrate and embrace them.

Juana Hurtado from Bolivia, has been in Hartford for just over a year. For Hurtado, the Day of the Dead each year brings intense grief and deep affection for the people she misses who passed away.
“It is always important to hold these events so that we do not lose what is culture, the traditions of always loving the people we have lost. As a community, it makes us fraternize and share the hard moments we have lived through,” Hurtado shared, holding back tears.
Hurtado sets up an altar in her home in honor of her parents and her husband, who recently passed away. She arranges chocolate breads and candles to light the way for them when they visit on the night of Nov. 1.

Tammy Ramos, a Meriden resident with a Mexican family, also sets up an altar in her home. Since her grandmother died, her mother began preparing one annually, and although she knows her grandmother will always be present, the Day of the Dead offers a different type closeness to her.
“I remember her much more than usual on this day. I feel her closer,” Ramos said. “Opening the doors of our home to her gives me a certain calm and peace to think that she visits us through the altar.”
Ramos brought her 4-year-old daughter to the event, who jumped around and showed off her painted face, which was made to look like a skull. Ramos’ younger son stayed home with her mother. Ramos said she wants to pass along her culture to her two children by setting up altars each year.

Lexi Grant drove from Manchester to pick up her grandmother in Vernon. Together, the two of them placed a photo of Grant’s deceased grandparents on the community altar on Pratt Street.
Grant’s Puerto Rican grandmother, Olga Iris De Jesús, has lived in Connecticut since she was 15 and had never celebrated Día de Muertos or set up an altar. When her granddaughter learned about the event, she encouraged her to participate.
“Putting the photos on the altar means that they died, yes, but on this day I remember them, I remember everything about them,” said De Jesús, as she paused and looked through the photos of her deceased husband.
Between mourning and celebration, Grant said her feelings were bittersweet. She reminisced about her grandparents. But, as she spent time visiting with people on Pratt Street, the dancing, candles, food and live music became like a comforting embrace.
“It is beautiful to bring together different communities and ethnicities, especially in the current political climate, to honor and feel proud of who we are, our roots and traditions,” Grant said.
“I think Hartford is very multicultural and I feel like it’s a place where one can be proud to say, ‘I’m from Hartford, Connecticut.’”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1018_SR_DiaDeLosMuertos_111-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 14:02:34.575980

(Photo via Getty Images)The Iowa Court of Appeals has upheld a $1.8 million civil penalty against a company that for almost 21 years failed to obtain the required permits for 750 miles of hazardous-liquid pipelines in Iowa.
Enterprise Products Operating had appealed a district court’s ruling that affirmed a decision by the Iowa Utilities Commission to fine the company $1.8 million for nine separate violations of a law requiring permits for interstate hazardous-liquid pipelines and underground storage facilities.
In its appeal, Enterprise argued the commission and the district court erred in deciding that Enterprise’s pipeline system required nine permits, rather than one, and had therefore committed nine violations of the law rather than one.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The company also claimed the commission lacked the authority to impose a civil penalty of more than $200,000 because the nine violations were each part of a “related series of violations” as defined by state law.
The appeals court ruled it could not consider Enterprise’s first claim because it did not preserve error by arguing that point when the case was before the commission and then the district court. The appeals court also found that the commission correctly interpreted the legal cap on penalties.
Enterprise owns and operates a hazardous-liquid pipeline system that crosses several states, Iowa included, and carries butane, propane and natural gas. The pipeline system — known as the Mid-America Pipeline System — was originally built and owned by the Mid-America Pipeline Company in the early 1960s.
In November 1997, Williams Natural Gas Liquids acquired Mid-America Pipeline, and in July 2002, Enterprise purchased a 98% ownership interest in that company and with it the entire Mid-America Pipeline System, which then included 750 miles of pipeline and underground storage facilities in Iowa.
In 1995, the Iowa Legislature then amended the state law in a manner that required pipeline operators to obtain new permits from the state. It is undisputed that Mid-America Pipeline Company — and then Williams, and then Enterprise — never sought those permits.
On Feb. 6, 2023, the commission notified Enterprise that it had discovered 750 miles of hazardous-liquid pipeline in Iowa were owned and operated by Enterprise and lacked the necessary permits. The commission demanded an explanation and scheduled a hearing at which the company could argue why it should not be subject to civil penalties.
Case turns on singular or plural use of ‘series’ 
At the hearing in March 2023, Enterprise explained that it was unaware of Iowa’s permit requirements and asserted that Williams had warranted that all state permit requirements were satisfied.
One month later, in April 2023, the commission issued an order imposing $1.8 million in civil penalties on Enterprise, alleging Enterprise had been operating nine hazardous-liquid pipelines and underground storage facilities without permits for almost 21 years.
It calculated that each of the nine violations had continued for 7,535 days — from when Enterprise acquired the pipeline system until it initiated efforts to obtain a permit – and that each of the nine violations warranted a $200,000 penalty.
At the time, the commission noted that due to the 21 years of daily violations, the penalty could have resulted in a total of $67.8 million in penalties had it not been for the Iowa law capping penalties at $200,000 per pipeline and underground storage facility.
In deciding to impose the maximum penalty, the commission took note of Enterprise’s market capitalization of $55.9 billion and its long record of working in the pipeline industry.
After Polk County District Judge Scott D. Rosenberg upheld the commission’s ruling, Enterprise filed its appeal, sending the case to the Iowa Court of Appeals.
In ruling in favor of the commission, the appeals court noted that Iowa law caps penalties at $200,000 for “any related series of violations,” with Enterprise arguing that its nine permit violations were all part of one “related series” since they were all tied to the same interconnected series of pipes.
“Even if we assume that Enterprise is correct that nine separate permit violations at different locations across Iowa — some for pipeline and others for underground storage facilities — can be considered related, this argument falters,” the court ruled. “It assumes that the word ‘series’ is being used as a plural noun rather a singular one — both forms are spelled the same. Only if ‘series’ were plural could the statute be capping multiple related series. If ‘series’ is singular, then the statute caps a single ‘series of violations’ that is ’related.’”

(Photo by Susan Tebben/Ohio Capital Journal)The Ohio Redistricting Commission passed a congressional map in a Friday morning meeting, increasing Republican advantage in the state and blocking a referendum effort.
The commission unanimously approved the map to raucous disapproval from the crowd gathered in the Ohio House Finance hearing room.
The map was introduced at Thursday’s meeting by commission co-chair and state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville.
Republicans currently hold 10 out of 15 Ohio U.S. Congressional districts.
The map gives Republicans the advantage in 12 of the 15 districts in the state, with Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan’s 4th district seeing the biggest GOP advantage at 72%.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown’s 11th district sees the biggest advantage in her party, according to the map, at 78%.
U.S. Reps. Marcy Kaptur, Greg Landsman, and Emilia Sykes would all see significant impacts to their district.
Landsman’s 1st district would lean Republican with a 54% to 47% breakdown.
Kaptur’s 9th district would lean Republican with a 54.5% to 45.5% Republican to Democratic ratio.
Sykes’ 13th district would lean Democratic, 52% to 48% Republican, according to data provided by the commission.
Stewart said the bipartisan passage was a mark of success for redistricting reforms that were passed in 2015 and 2018, and for the commission itself.
“I think there was a very real incentive and a desire amongst the legislative leaders … that we want this process the voters approved to work,” Stewart said.
“I think there is an intention that there would be some compromises, there would be some recognition of the fact that we would like to come out of here with a deal that both parties could move forward with for multiple years.”
Democrats on the commission voted to adopt the map because they said they were in an “impossible” situation in which they were provided worse options and felt they needed to take the opportunity to get the best map available.
House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, said the process was out of their control, so they did what they could to preserve Democratic opportunities.
“This is not the congressional map that Ohioans deserve, however, I do believe with this map we have averted a disaster,” said Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood.
The previous map, adopted in March 2022, had a breakdown of 10 Republican districts and five Democratic districts.
In September, Democrats proposed a map that would have had eight Republican and seven Democratic districts.
That map heard hours of supportive testimony in the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting, but never received a vote.
Republican leaders on the commission, including Gov. Mike DeWine, approved of the commission-created map, saying it was a proper compromise across the aisle.
They also acknowledged motivation that a referendum would not happen with passage by the commission.
Without bipartisan approval by the commission, the congressional redistricting process would have headed back to the General Assembly.
Once there, legislators could have passed a map with a simple majority in the Republican supermajority that makes up both chambers.
Auditor of State Keith Faber said the argument that the state’s voting trends, 55% Republican to 45% Democratic, would bring a map with eight GOP and seven Dem districts doesn’t represent “Ohio’s political geography.”
“This concept that you’re going to be able to draw districts within that range without gerrymandering is false,” Faber said. “… You can’t get to an 8-7 map without unnecessarily splitting and dividing (cities, counties and townships).”
Ohioans expressed their disagreement with Faber, saying state leaders and legislators just hadn’t worked hard enough to get to maps that match that ratio.
Testimony at Thursday’s and Friday’s meeting had a unified message: Ohioans who attended the meetings greatly disapproved of not only the 12-3 map, but the process to get to the adoption.
“This isn’t a compromise, it’s a threat,” Julia Cattaneo, of Columbus, told the commission.
Stewart on Thursday had referred to the people who attended the meeting — many of whom have regularly attended meetings over the several years of the congressional and statehouse redistricting battles in Ohio — as “paid actors.”
On Friday, some citizens pinned “not a paid actor” labels on their shirts.
They continued their shaming of the commission for “ignoring the law, ignoring the voters,” as Mia Lewis of Common Cause Ohio put it, and emphasizing the need to take politicians out of the redistricting process.
“I wish that the argument between committee members had been about how to fairly draw up county lines that would have fine-tuned those districts to be more accurate,” said Columbus resident Beth Lykins.
“…I think what I say here doesn’t really matter in the end. You will do what you want to do and I have to live with the realization that our government doesn’t work in the way I was taught in my Youth in Government program.”
The map has the potential to be legally challenged, which would be done at the Ohio Supreme Court.
Previous map challenges in the redistricting process, including the 10-5 redistricting map used for the most recent elections, have been struck down as unduly partisan.
The makeup of the state supreme court has changed since then, however.
Current Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy stood in the minority in previous votes on redistricting maps, saying she would have kept the maps in place.
The current supreme court is made up of six Republican justices and one Democratic justice.

They carried employees of the state of Alaska — footsoldiers in a long-running turf war with the federal government.It was early August, but the high peaks above the lake were already dusted with fresh snow. On a beach at the water’s edge, the passengers climbed out.They carried guns — but only for bears, not for federal bureaucrats. The lake was deserted.
One of the state workers, Danny Hovancsek, looked down at the sand.
“Welcome to contested land,” he said.
From the two planes, Hovancsek and his colleagues unloaded bags and boxes of gear, including the documentary tools that serve as the real weapons in their war: drones, notebooks, a sophisticated sensor to measure river flow and current.
Two Lakes, the body of water they’d flown into, and the Necons River, which drains it, both sit within the boundaries of federally managed Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.
But Hovancsek and his colleagues were there to assert a legal claim to them on behalf of the residents of Alaska, based on precedent that entitles the state to land beneath navigable waters.

The following day, the group would inflate the rafts they’d flown in with and begin floating the river, gathering data they may ultimately need to try to prove the Necons’ navigability to a judge in an Anchorage courtroom.
Other groups from the same state agency, the Department of Natural Resources, had taken similar trips on different rivers in the preceding weeks — part of a renewed, professionalized push to confirm ownership of land within federal parks and preserves that Alaska’s government says became state property at statehood.
The department’s Public Access Assertion and Defense team is a group of roughly a dozen state workers who have, arguably, Alaska’s best public sector jobs. They spend large parts of their summers flying into and floating the state’s remote rivers and lakes, then spend the winters wielding the data they’ve gathered in court.
I was along for the ride. Top department officials — one of whom would sit in a raft along with me — had invited me to observe the state’s efforts, which they say could ultimately help settle the ownership of thousands of miles of Alaska riverbeds, plus millions of acres beneath the surface of lakes.

The work is often done quietly, with the state-sponsored flotillas keeping an intentionally low-profile to avoid giving federal land managers a head start on fighting Alaska’s claims.
But the stakes are substantial, as state and federal regimes can diverge when it comes to managing access and setting rules for boaters, hunters and fishermen, and small-scale miners.
“Anyone who’s looking to paddle a river doesn’t know who to look to for jurisdiction,” Hovancsek said.
“I believe in good governance,” he added. “And right now, we don’t know who owns the rivers of Alaska.”
A decades-long fight
At the beach, 130 miles from the national park’s headquarters in Anchorage, there was no indication of federal ownership — no informational kiosks or park rangers.
But the federal government’s resistance to Alaska’s land claims, both through active opposition and simple inaction, was the reason we were all there.
For more than a half-century, Alaska land managers have been fighting successive federal administrations through the courts as well as lengthy administrative processes — battling what they describe as an unwillingness to negotiate from officials of both political parties at the U.S. Department of the Interior, the federal land management agency.
The state has notched numerous wins, including affirming control of land beneath the Stikine River in Southeast Alaska, the Knik River outside Anchorage and multiple forksof the gold-bearing Fortymile River in Alaska’s Interior.

(Alaska Department of Natural Resource/Public Access Assertion and Defense Section)
But thousands more miles across dozens of rivers and creeks are still in limbo. And state officials say that in spite of their commitment to the cause, there’s no way each of those stretches will be litigated.
Instead, they aim to file enough lawsuits to make the process painful enough to force the federal government into broader settlement discussions.
“The goal is to sit with them at a table and decide this,” said Jim Walker, the public access team’s chief.
The state’s efforts made little headway during the Biden administration, which clashed often with Alaska officials on resource extraction and land management.
But now, the team sees an opening in Donald Trump’s return to power.
In line with the state’s push, Trump, in an early, Alaska-focused executive order, directed the Interior Department to review the state’s waterways and land ownership.
At a June news conference, the department’s secretary, Doug Burgum, said that as a former governor of North Dakota, he worked on the same issues through the end of his term last year.

“We need to get this thing resolved,” he said. “Even though, right now, there may be differences of opinion, I think we can find some common ground.”
But months later, the Interior Department has not announced any concrete steps to advance negotiations with the state. Alaska’s land-related lawsuits against the federal government remain active. And members of the public access team continue their work in the field.
“Everything starts at zero”
The day after our arrival at Two Lakes, as team members took down tents and washed dishes, one of them passed me a handheld luggage scale and jokingly deputized me as an “agent of state sovereignty.” My task: finding 800 pounds of gear to load into one of the rafts.
Those instructions rested on a century and a half of federal law and jurisprudence that set out legal standards the state must meet to confirm its ownership of what are known as “submerged lands.”

The paper trail starts with the Daniel Ball case — an 1870 U.S. Supreme Court ruling holding that waterways are considered navigable if they can be used as “highways for commerce.”
The Submerged Lands Act, in 1953, solidified states’ ownership of property beneath rivers and lakes that were navigable at the time of statehood.
And a key 1980s federal appeals court case helped establish which types of watercraft could be used to float down an Alaska river — and the amount of weight they should carry — to support a finding of navigability. Hence the 800 pounds.
The public access team can present data they collect on their trips, and records of successful floats, to judges considering the state’s arguments in lawsuits over stretches of particular rivers.
The state can also request that the federal government issue what’s known as a “recordable disclaimer of interest” in submerged lands through a separate, administrative process handled by the Interior Department.
But that process takes five years, on average, to resolve each application — and in some cases it can take more than 10 years, according to federal data. Lawsuits also typically wind through the courts for years.
The glacial bureaucratic processes leave maps of Alaska rife with areas of underwater land where the ownership is in legal limbo — and where the public access team is trying to solidify the state’s title.
Their work is focused largely on the areas, like Lake Clark, that were formally protected by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, or ANILCA.

That landmark bill set aside more than one-fourth of the state as federal park or preserve.
But while those areas are now generally understood to be federally managed, ANILCA came after statehood — meaning that land beneath navigable rivers and lakes inside those areas had, legally, already been set aside for the state.
Alaska officials complain that the federal government has long drawn out the process of acknowledging the precise extent of the state’s ownership within national parks and preserves. Federal lawyers, they say, continue to argue over issues that have already been settled by previous decisions, like the size or weight of boats that are used to prove navigability.
“It’s just frustrating to have to argue the same things again and again,” said Ron Opsahl, the state’s main navigability attorney, who floated the Necons with the public access team. “Everything starts at zero.”

Criticism like this has a whiff of the hyperbole that Alaska politicians often employ when complaining about federal bureaucrats.
But in this case, there’s evidence Opsahl is right: In a 2016 navigability ruling frequently cited by state officials, a judge ruled that federal attorneys had acted in “bad faith” by making frivolous legal claims — arguments that had been previously refuted by federal appeals court and U.S. Supreme Court judges.
In conversations with team members on our wilderness trip, I came to see state land managers’ feud with the federal government as something like appealing a claim denied by your health insurance company: counterparts who won’t acknowledge your presence, endless wait times.
“It’s hard to beat an opponent that won’t fight you,” said Hovancsek. He conceded: “In the chess game of landownership, they’re making good moves.”
The public access team had invited me along on the Necons River to show me what one of them described as the “senselessness” of the federal government’s arguments over navigability.
I finished loading the raft and jumped in. As an icy drizzle soaked our raincoats, we turned from the beach toward the lake’s outlet and the start of the river.
“Fighting the big man”
Our group on the Necons was a flotilla of four rafts; I’d loaded up with Walker, who runs the public access office.
Before Walker, the team was led by Scott Ogan, a Republican former state senator from the conservative Mat-Su region; his scouting missions involved more camouflage gear and canned chili than the state’s trips do today.
Walker, an attorney with a silver goatee and an impish sense of humor, looked like he’d be more comfortable in a business suit and a courtroom than in a boat cockpit.

But even as the rain soaked through his gear, Walker was relentlessly cheerful as he pushed on the oars. He described how he sees his work for the state as an extension of his previous career as a defense lawyer in the South, where he sometimes handled death penalty cases.
“When I took this job, people said, ‘You made a career fighting the man. Now, you are the man,’” said Walker. His response: “I’m the little man fighting the big man.”
Walker started with the team in 2014. Soon after, amid a state budget crunch, lawmakers cut the public access team’s budget to near-zero.
In the past several years, it’s been largely restored amid a broader effort by GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy to assert state sovereignty in disputes with the federal government. The team’s current budget is some $1.3 million a year, according to figures provided by the Legislative Finance Division.
Without exception, Walker describes his team members as “hard chargers” — the type who, in one case, will spend a vacation bikepacking over snowy mountain passes in Kyrgyzstan rather than lounging on a beach.
Employees are granted ample autonomy and independence, with blocks of time off to make up for long hours in the office and in the field. While scenic, their float trips should not be confused with recreation, according to Tisha Valentine, a team member who was part of the group on the Necons.

“I’m up at 11 o’clock at night, on weekends, doing data collection,” Valentine said. “It’s not all fun and games.”
The team works in a few areas in addition to navigability; one is assembling records of historical trail use that the state can used to assert public access across federal or private land.
On their trips, employees like Valentine get periodic company from attorneys like Opsahl, who want to familiarize themselves with rivers in advance of representing the state in lawsuits over the lands beneath them.
Other top officials at the public access team’s parent agency, the Department of Natural Resources, also tag along occasionally. Brent Goodrum, a deputy department commissioner and retired Marine, is known for his eagerness to contribute to group tasks — or, as colleagues joke, to “storm the beaches.”

A little downstream from Two Lakes’ outlet, Walker nosed our raft to shore, pulling up next to the other boats that had beached there. I stepped into the muck as team members unloaded gear: a waterproof laptop and a duffel bag carrying a tool nicknamed Antonio.
Antonio is a sensor that collects data — stream flow measurements — that the state uses to bolster its navigability claims. It consists of a small, cylindrical device attached to a miniature plastic catamaran that runs back and forth on a cable across the river — meaning that we’d have to fix a line to the far shore some 50 yards away.
I took one end and jumped back in a raft with Jon Fuller, a hydrologist from Arizona who works as a state contractor.

Fuller furiously paddled the boat to the opposite riverbank, where I jumped out and clung to the willows to keep from sliding down the steep bank — suspecting, at least a little, that this was the team’s way of showing me that their raft trips aren’t just sightseeing.
In the meantime, other team members sent up a drone with a camera that they use to document the group’s progress down the river, along with key geographic features. Hovancsek, who was controlling the camera, at one point looked down at his feet, which were planted not on dry land but in a few inches of Necons River water.

Drone operation, he explained, is not allowed in national parks. But it is allowed on state property — which, the state says, includes the submerged land over which the Necons flows, and into which Hovancsek had stepped.
Over the course of our trip, we made several stops like this one, gathering stream flow data and imagery that the state could ultimately cite in a lawsuit.
What are the stakes?
After two days on the Necons, it arrived at its confluence with the Stony River — a broad, pebbly waterway that spills out of the mountains.
The next night, as the chill drizzle finally gave way to high, broken clouds, I found myself standing at the water’s edge, looking at far-off mountain ranges and pondering the fact that I couldn’t say for certain who owned the mud beneath my Xtratuf boots.
That prompted some deeper reflection and conversation about the public access team’s work — and how management of Alaska’s lands might differ under state ownership.
Our route, by that point, had taken us out of the national park. As we crossed the boundary into state territory, Goodrum, the deputy natural resources department commissioner, had asked mischievously: “Don’t you feel freer, Nat?” Walker added his own joke: “There’s a coal mine just behind the willows there.”
In truth, though, little seemed to change. Inside the national park, no rangers had passed by to check our campsites, and permits and entry fees aren’t required for recreational trips.

Given how far the Necons is from roads and other infrastructure, it’s also hard to imagine much industry moving in, even under a more flexible state management regime.
But the Necons is probably an extreme case, where its remoteness means there’s less at stake.
A change in ownership could have larger impacts on busier waterways with contested stretches, such as in the Kobuk and Noatak watersheds in Northwest Alaska.
There, affirmation of state ownership of submerged lands and riverbanks could make for easier access — potentially amplifying conflicts between locals and nonresidentsfor limited hunting and fishing opportunities.
Two recent high-profile U.S. Supreme Court decisions, in the Sturgeon cases, also created more incentive for the team’s work by confirming the state’s management authority in the areas it owns within national parks and preserves.
That particular ruling allowed a hunter to operate a hovercraft on a navigable river within a preserve in Alaska’s Interior — where National Park Service rangers had previously told the hunter that his hovercraft was banned.
Public access team members and the political officials who oversee them are also quick to argue on principle. Decisions about how to manage Alaska’s navigable waterways, said Walker, “should be made by Alaskans, and not made in Washington by folks who don’t appreciate and haven’t experienced this place.”
“As has been said repeatedly, in U.S. Supreme Court opinions and elsewhere: Alaska is different,” Walker said.

One former high-level federal land manager in Alaska, Pat Pourchot, said he understands that the state has an obligation to confirm its ownership of lands beneath navigable waters.
But, he added, there’s also a reason the federal government should review each claim deliberately: A decision about one river in Alaska, Pourchot argued, could set a precedent for rivers across the country.
“You don’t want to allow a determination of navigability on some really small stream running through a conservation area in Alaska that some other state might push for — say, for the wild and scenic Buffalo River in Arkansas,” said Pourchot, who’s served both as Alaska’s top Interior Department official and as the state natural resources commissioner.
Congressional proposals to address state-federal navigability disputes in Alaska have gotten similarly “bogged down,” Pourchot added.
“Again, you go from Alaska to the nation: How does this apply in West Virginia coal mine country, and how does this apply to other wild and scenic rivers?” said Pourchot, referring to rivers with federal protections.
Pourchot said he also sees state ownership as a possible precursor to expanded mining or oil and gas leasing in ways that conflict with the purpose of national parks and preserves.
But another longtime participant in the state-federal navigability war thinks there’s a tendency on both sides to overstate the stakes of the dispute.
“The feds will say, ‘If the state manages it, they’ll allow coal mining everywhere. They’ll give permits to any outfitter for any reason, for doing anything.’ And that’s just not true,” said Doug Whittaker, an outdoor recreation expert who consults for the public access team.
On the other hand, Whittaker added, state officials say, “‘The feds are going to close everything; you’re never going to get on a river.’”
“That’s not really a thing, either,” Whittaker said. “They’re both exaggerating.”

There are real differences between the two sides, with federal management leaning more restrictive and state management more permissive, Whittaker said. But the reality, he added, is less dramatic than the rhetoric.
Whittaker nonetheless supports the state’s work to settle more of its claims to Alaska riverbeds, saying that ambiguity about landownership can cause real problems.
He pointed to plans the state drafted for the Fortymile River to better regulate small-scale mining operations that posed a risk of fuel spills. That work, he added, advanced only after litigation helped affirm the state’s ownership of the river’s gravel bars and banks.
“What I care about is management. And I think both the state and feds can do a good job of managing; they can also do a bad job,” Whittaker said. “I don’t really care who owns it. But I think they should agree on the rules.”
Breaking the logjam
The sun was finally warming us and drying our gear as we pulled the rafts off the water at our take-out point, the confluence of the Stony and Telaquana rivers.
We were early: Float planes wouldn’t be dispatched from Anchorage to retrieve us for another day-and-a-half. And a storm was on its way, according to a weather forecast that Anchorage-based support staff had sent the team through a satellite messaging device.

Walker cheekily suggested that we should gather ark-building material — ”pitch and gopher wood” — for the impending flood. Other team members tried to coordinate an early pickup; their Anchorage flight service, busy with summer tourists, eventually agreed to send a plane.
There was enough room for a few of us, and some of the public access team members needed to get home; the last seat would go either to me or Fuller, the consulting hydrologist. I threw rock, he threw scissors. I would be flying out before the deluge.
As we waited, we discussed our trip down the Necons. After floating its full length from Two Lakes, it was difficult to see how the federal government could plausibly argue that it’s not navigable.
It was deep, with just a couple of riffles in 15 miles. None of the rafts had run aground or even hit bottom, except on a short jaunt down a side channel.

And yet, more than four decades ago, the federal government determined that the Necons is non-navigable, according to the state’s public access team, and hasn’t changed its position since then. (Federal officials could not be reached for comment about the Necons’ navigability due to the ongoing government shutdown.)
“It’s astounding the federal government is wasting everyone’s money fighting this,” said Fuller.
“If this isn’t fucking navigable,” Opsahl, the state attorney, chimed in, “I don’t know what is.”
The team’s frustration was palpable.
But when I picked up my reporting back in Anchorage, following a presidential election, things had changed.
Walker, in a recent interview, said his team has met with Trump administration officials and presented them with big-picture policy proposals aimed at breaking the navigability logjam. One idea is agreeing on basic principles that would apply to a state application asking the federal government to relinquish an array of riverbeds, rather than just one at a time.
“Instead of going through and giving minute details about every mile of these rivers, we talk, rather, about our methodology and why it’s so sound,” Walker said. “Hopefully, this would begin a dialogue.”

In a prepared statement issued before the shutdown, an Alaska-based spokesperson for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Emma Roach, said the agency understands the frustration about the pace of its navigability decisions in the state.
The bureau, which is part of the Interior Department, is excited to pursue improvements in response to Trump’s executive order encouraging progress on the dispute, Roach added.
Evaluating navigability claims “is a complex process — made especially complex in a state as vast, remote, and young as Alaska,” she said.
“But working together on this and other related navigability initiatives, we can make substantial progress,” Roach added. “The state’s title to submerged lands at statehood is well recognized, and we’re committed to supporting that process moving forward.”
For now, though, the team’s work continues, with trips this past summer outside Anchorage and up to the Seward Peninsula, on the Alaska side of the Bering Strait.
Some of that work could support new litigation if the state’s talks with the federal government fail. And public access team members acknowledge that there are no guarantees the Trump administration will concede much.
Past Republican administrations have generally been more sympathetic to Alaska leaders’ complaints about federal management. But they’ve still accomplished little more than Democrats when it comes to resolving the big-picture dispute over Alaska’s submerged lands and navigable waters, according to state officials.
“It’s surprising,” said Goodrum, the deputy state natural resources commissioner. “We haven’t made progress on this issue regardless of who’s in office.”
Walker, the public access team chief, said he’s hopeful the recent meetings will produce results. But, he added, “this is not our first rodeo.”
“We’ve heard encouraging words before, which have not translated into results,” he said. “And so very much, in our dealings with the feds right now, we’re trying to put the past behind us — and look forward to constructively and cooperatively getting some of this stuff resolved.”

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)I was born in Mississippi to Indian-immigrant parents who came here in the late 1960s, drawn by the promise of American ingenuity and opportunity, as well as the openness created by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. 
My father first arrived as a post-doctoral fellow and was soon recruited to Mississippi as a professor. He was part of a wave of immigrant scholars who helped build higher education and research across the South, especially at historically Black colleges and universities. 
My mother began her career there as a special education teacher — one of the first in her district — and later became a small business owner alongside my father. Together they built a life in Mississippi rooted in education, entrepreneurship and service to the community.
Their story is one of grit, contribution and building opportunity — not just for themselves but for generations to follow.
Today, I am a professor of public health at a top 10 public health school and was recently elected to the National Academy of Medicine. My journey was made possible by the infrastructure, the research labs and the faculty pipelines the generation before me helped create. 
But I now fear that the talent pipeline that once brought global scholars and students to the United States — especially to the Gulf South — is beginning to dry up.
Shrinking pipeline of global talent
Once dominant in recruiting international students and scholars, U.S. higher education is now under serious strain. A recent New York Times analysis showed a steep decline in international student enrollment in the past year, particularly in the South. The reason for concern is not just demographic: our capacity to lead in research and innovation is at stake.
International students and scholar-trainees have long been central to American science, technology and medicine. These fields, in turn, power local and national economies. 
When fewer such individuals choose the U.S., we all pay a price.
The data are clear:

Foreign-born individuals comprised nearly 26% of workers in STEM occupations in 2021, up from 16.4% in 2000.
International students in the U.S. contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 378,175 jobs in the past year.
In Louisiana alone, approximately 6,891 international students accounted for 2,269 jobs and about $264.8 million in economic impact in the past year.

These numbers are not about replacing U.S.-born talent; they are about complementing it, strengthening the research enterprise, enabling richer mentoring, deeper collaboration and more robust innovation ecosystems. 
U.S.-born students benefit from having colleagues and mentors drawn from global networks, as do local employers in health care, energy and technology – leading industries for our state and nation.
Why the Gulf South feels it most
In the Gulf South, where higher‐education institutions often compete with fewer resources, the contribution of international scholars and students has been particularly important. 
Many immigrant faculty, including my father, helped build research programs in biology, engineering, public health and medicine at universities that long had been under-resourced. They created labs, attracted grants, trained both U.S.-born and international students, and strengthened regional capacity in major industries such as healthcare and energy.
For example, the health care workforce in this region depends not only on graduating U.S.-born professionals but also on attracting and training people who bring diverse research perspectives and advanced expertise. 
Similarly, the energy economy — still so vital in states like Louisiana and Mississippi — benefits when universities and research institutions can recruit global talent to advance new technologies in offshore energy, coastal resilience, climate mitigation and biomedical innovation.
When fewer international scholars and students choose U.S. institutions — especially in the South — the ripple effects include fewer research grants, fewer innovations and fewer trained professionals staying and contributing regionally. 
It’s not about foreign-born replacing U.S.-born; it’s about all of us doing better by working together.
Keeping the door open to excellence
We must remember that world-class universities and ambitious regional economies don’t emerge by accident. They need global networks, diverse talent and a commitment to staying competitive in science, technology, and medicine.
You cannot have world-class universities if you cannot recruit the best from around the world. And the South needs that more than anyone. Because in recruiting nationally, we already face structural disadvantages.
This is not about elevating one group over another. It’s about building institutions, industries and communities strong enough to serve both U.S.-born and immigrant students, researchers and professionals. It’s about recognizing that when we invest in global talent, we uplift the entire ecosystem: faculty, students, local economies, health care systems, energy innovation and beyond.
My parents’ generation came here, accepted the challenge and built programs when the door was open. Today, we must decide if we will keep that door open — not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it is the smart thing to do for every citizen and every community.

By nearly every measure, American farmers are struggling.
Experts say financial pressures are expected to continue mounting.
Due to rising costs, low crop prices and the effects of the trade war, economists project that growers could see roughly $44 billion in net cash income losses from their 2025–26 crops.
At a September conference on agriculture and trade uncertainty hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank, Shawn Arita, professor at North Dakota State University and former senior economist with the USDA, presented projections showing losses across nine major crops.

With production costs far outpacing revenue, Arita and his team at the NDSU Agricultural Risk Policy Center estimate losses of about $20 billion for corn, $10 billion for soybeans and $8.5 billion for wheat — with peanuts, cotton, barley, oats, grain sorghum and rice adding another $6 billion combined.
Since 2023, U.S. farmers have struggled with high input costs and weak commodity prices, a squeeze economists attribute partly to the Russia-Ukraine war.
But this squeeze is made worse by the loss of key export markets — particularly China.
“The tariffs are creating challenges, but it’s not fair to say they are the main culprit,” Arita said. “Certainly, they are exacerbating the issue.”
Arita also noted that the crop sector tends to follow trade cycles more closely than inflation trends. “[China is] not going to start buying soybeans until they get something out of these negotiations,” he said during his presentation.

Still, the main problem remains high costs across the board — tractors, machinery, fertilizers and other inputs, many of which are imported. Although it’s too early to determine whether President Trump’s tariffs will have an effect on these prices, Arita said it’s “simple economics”: higher taxes on these products inevitably lead to higher production costs.
While some farmers are expected to receive financial assistance through the Big Beautiful Bill, that support isn’t set to arrive until October 2026.

I put on my green volunteer shirt and started sorting food donations from around the state with a group of strangers.
We sorted donations: protein shakes, peanut butter, Turkish figs, ranch dressing, hamburger helper, soda, evaporated milk, crushed tomatoes, cream of mushroom soup, apple sauce, payday candy bars, chips. “Don’t worry about expiration dates on food,” a volunteer who had logged 8,000 hours told me. “Just look if they’re medications/supplements or baby products.”
The generosity of people, of the donations is truly remarkable. That this food will find its way to people gives me hope. The quality of the food — or lack of — also kept crossing my mind. Highly processed food, loads of artificial sugars and ingredients, banged-up cans, all kinds of food dyes. It made me wonder what the people who received the items thought.
But their alternative was nothing to eat.

That afternoon, I finished “The Glass Castle,” which now shows up on banned-books lists. It’s a remarkable memoir by Jeannette Walls about hope, resilience and redemption. It’s also about poverty, family dynamics, family dysfunction, addiction, food insecurity, essentially navigating difficult life situations with perseverance. It’s a story of hope during the worst of times. Banning such a book deprives potential readers of examples of a path forward, a way out of whatever challenge people might be struggling with also gets banned.
As our country braces for cut-offs of SNAP, the federal program that helps low-income families afford food, the number of people facing hunger should make every heart hurt. Adding to their pain are skyrocketing health insurance premium costs. In Colorado, more than 600,000 people rely on SNAP to fill a gap in their life. It’s also projected that 80,000 Coloradans will lose health insurance if the Affordable Care Act tax credits expire. Of these 600,000 people who rely on SNAP, half are children. Kids.


When hunger rises, so can we.


Hunger, like many stigmas, is often invisible.
When our team a few weeks ago spent time in the San Luis Valley, an impoverished region of Colorado, to better understand SNAP, food, and its impact especially on older adults in rural communities, we found that meals for seniors had already stopped due to budget cuts. That loss of food was before SNAP faced any potential hits. Community pantries simply cannot fill these enormous gaps.
Seniors in this country already must worry about where they might live if they lose Medicaid, and now when they will get their next meal.
Meanwhile, a $300 million ballroom is being constructed where the East Wing of the White House once stood. We saw that demolition while millions live in fear. They worry about their next paycheck, their next meal, their next medical bill, their ability to afford health insurance. They are afraid to go to school or to work. They can’t go for a walk, go to the doctor, buy groceries, fill their cars with gas without dread. They can’t put a sign in front of their house, they worry about speaking any language but English. They fear being in public.
Fear affects us on a cellular level. It impacts our health in significant ways.
When I checked in to volunteer at the food bank, there’s a sign that reads, “When hunger rises, so can we.”
It’s a great sentence that I keep repeating, and a sentence that can be used for so much:
When hate rises, so can we.
When fear rises, so can we.
When injustice rises, so can we. 
I recently drove home from work behind a car that had a pride flag on its back window with the words “defend equality” and a gigantic machine gun over the flag. I had to watch it for about 30 minutes until we took separate exits, and I took my first real exhale.
As I finished the drive home, I remembered this short clip a friend sent me of an older woman sitting on a park bench outside. She looks at the camera and says, “When your kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews ask you what did you do, what will you tell them?”
I will not say I stayed quiet. Because, when hope rises, so can we.

Seven Great Walks in Delaware from riverfront paths to forested preserves.
Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live | October 2025
“Golf,” Mark Twain once joked, “is a good walk spoiled.” While many Delawareans love their time on the greens, they are also leaning into the simple joy of the walk itself. This time of year, as trails glow with color and the air turns crisp, walking has become one of the most refreshing ways to experience Delaware’s natural beauty.
Across the First State, walking is finding its stride, and it’s not just about fitness. It is about connection, balance, and belonging. The simplicity of putting one foot in front of the other has the power to strengthen hearts, clear minds, and bring people together.
Why walking works
Walking remains one of the easiest and most effective forms of exercise. The American Heart Association reports that just 30 minutes of brisk walking a day can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 27 percent. Researchers at Harvard University recently found that adults who walk regularly can reduce their overall mortality risk by nearly 25 percent, even without high-intensity workouts.
It is not only physical health that improves. Walking outdoors can lift mood, sharpen focus, and ease anxiety. A 2023 study in The Lancet Public Health linked regular walking to lower rates of depression and higher life satisfaction across all age groups.
Health benefits at a glance
Even short daily walks can have measurable effects:

Improve heart and lung health by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol
Support healthy weight and boost metabolism
Strengthen joints and muscles, reducing stiffness and pain
Increase mental clarity and creativity
Lower stress and anxiety through the release of endorphins
Improve sleep quality and overall mood
Reduce the risk of chronic illness, including Type 2 diabetes and certain cancers
Build community connection through shared, screen-free time outdoors

Where Delaware walks
From riverfront paths to forested preserves, Delaware offers countless places to stretch your legs and enjoy the seasons.
Brandywine Creek State Park (Wilmington): Wooded trails from 1.5 to 5 miles through rolling hills and streams.
Jack A. Markell Trail (Wilmington to New Castle): A 5.5-mile paved path linking the city’s riverfront to New Castle’s historic district.
White Clay Creek State Park (Newark): Forest and meadow loops from 2 to 4 miles, rich with wildlife.
Newark Reservoir: A smooth 2.3-mile paved loop with wide-open water views.
Brecknock County Park (Camden): Family-friendly trails surrounded by shaded woods.
Junction and Breakwater Trail (Lewes to Rehoboth): Six scenic miles between coastal towns, bordered by pines and marshland.
Cape Henlopen State Park (Lewes): Ocean-view loops ranging from 1 to 3 miles near dunes and beach paths.
Aim for 20 to 30 minutes at a comfortable pace. Bring water, wear supportive shoes, and if you enjoy company, check local parks, libraries, or community centers for group walks and wellness meetups.
The power of community on the move
Walking is not only a path to better health. It is also a bridge to connection. In towns across Delaware, small walking groups have become weekly rituals that bring together people who might otherwise never cross paths. Conversations come easily when the pace is unhurried, and the world around you is alive with color and sound.
When walking becomes a shared habit, its benefits grow even stronger. Neighbors who meet for morning strolls, families who explore local trails on weekends, and coworkers who walk together at lunch all gain something deeper – community. A consistent walking routine creates both accountability and belonging, two of the most powerful motivators for lasting well-being.
A habit worth keeping
Walking is a way to explore Delaware’s landscapes, and to reconnect with what truly moves us – nature, people, and purpose. Every trail offers a chance to see something new, whether it is a heron lifting from the marsh, a friend’s story unfolding beside you, or a deeper breath of fresh air. Wherever you are in the First State, every season offers another reason to step outside and keep walking.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Markell_WilmTrailhead-002.jpg,,,2025-10-31 13:04:23.142859

Free.,Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be transferred to Tennessee for hearings on criminal charges,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kilmar-abrego-garcia-be-transferred-tennessee-hearings-criminal-charges,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Maryland on Friday approved the transfer of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from immigration detention in Pennsylvania to Nashville, Tennessee, for a multi-day hearing in his criminal case brought by the Trump administration after an erroneous deportation to El Salvador. The Trump administration previously planned as soon as Friday to again deport Abrego Garcia, this time to the West African country of Liberia. Abrego Garcia has protections from deportation to his home country of El Salvador after an immigration judge in 2019 feared he would face violence if removed there. Maryland District Judge Paula Xinis will allow for the transfer for his multi-day hearing on Nov. 4 and 5, according to court documents. Xinis, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, is overseeing Abrego Garcia’s challenge to his detention, which is separate from the criminal case. His attorneys argue the Trump administration is keeping Abrego Garcia in detention to punish him, rather than seeking deportation. Abrego Garcia has agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, which has offered to accept him as a refugee. The Trump administration also has floated several other African countries as deportation destinations for Abrego Garcia: Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.Deportation, criminal chargesThe Trump administration in March erroneously deported Abrego Garcia, a longtime Maryland resident, to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador — a move that thrust a spotlight on the realities of the president's immigration crackdown. Facing mounting pressures from various courts that ordered Abrego Garcia’s return, the Trump administration brought him back in June to face criminal charges lodged against him by the Justice Department that stemmed from a traffic stop in 2022. Those charges, to which Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty, accuse him of smuggling migrants across the country. The federal judge overseeing Abrego Garcia’s criminal trial in Nashville, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, this week filed an order warning Trump administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, they could face sanctions if they continue to make inflammatory remarks about Abrego Garcia. Members of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, have without evidence repeatedly labeled Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 gang member. Tennessee hearingThe multi-day hearing for Abrego Garcia in Tennessee comes after Crenshaw earlier this month found there was a ""likelihood"" that the DOJ indictment against Abrego Garcia was vindictive. Obama also nominated Crenshaw.Abrego Garcia was living in Maryland with his wife and their three children when he was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents earlier this year and notified that there had been a change in his status. Because of the deportation protections, Abrego Garcia was required to check in with ICE each year.",,,,2025-10-31 13:04:23.142859

Kathy Hogan, from left, Gov. Kelly Armstrong and Sen. David Hogue hold an Ethics Commission selection committee meeting Sept. 23, 2025, at the Capitol. (Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)State officials have tapped former Office of Management and Budget Director Pam Sharp to fill one of the three open seats on the North Dakota Ethics Commission, but remain divided on the reappointment of one commissioner.
“I think Pam Sharp has more knowledge about what goes on in this place than just about anybody else,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a Friday morning meeting with Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, and Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo.
Sharp will succeed Ward Koeser, one of the original five members of the commission, and will serve a four-year term.
She led the Office of Management and Budget from 2003 to 2018 and is currently retired.
In her interview with the selection committee, Sharp said her background gives her an extensive understanding of how the executive branch works.
“I do feel I can bring value that perhaps not everyone has,” she said.
She said she would advocate for the Ethics Commission to be “very transparent” and “say everything they can say.”

Sharp also expressed support for the commission providing public education on how to navigate ethical issues.
“I do think the Ethics Commission is the place to give that advice,” she said. “How can you go wrong with education?”
On Friday, Armstrong, Hogue and Hogan remained at odds over who to pick for the remaining two open positions. The three state leaders indicated they would reconvene early next week to resume discussions.
The selection committee must appoint commissioners by a consensus vote. They have been meeting since August to select the commission’s next members.
The committee is at a standstill over whether to appoint commissioner Murray Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney, to another term. Sagsveen joined the commission in late 2024 after former chair Paul Richard announced his retirement.
Hogan and Hogue have both identified Sagsveen as a favorite, though Armstrong has said he is unwilling to vote for him.
Governor wants ‘reset’ from North Dakota Ethics Commission as committee deadlocks on candidates

Armstrong in a previous meeting expressed a desire to replace Sagsveen because of the Ethics Commission’s tenuous relationship with the executive branch, which Armstrong said warrants a “general reset” of the board’s culture.
Sagsveen also expressed during the selection process that he feels the state Legislature has passed unconstitutional laws that limit the commission’s authority, which Armstrong said he disagrees with.
Hogue and Hogan both said Friday that their support for Sagsveen hasn’t changed.
“I think Mr. Sagsveen is the best, and I’m in the habit of hiring the best,” Hogue said.
Sagsveen is seeking another four-year term after his seat expired Aug. 31. The other open position was left by former chair Dave Anderson, who died in May. Anderson’s term expires Aug. 31, 2026.
Last week, selection committee members also identified Jared Huibregtse, a project manager for a Mandan engineering firm, and Mark Western, a Fargo attorney, as top picks. The state received 39 applicants for the open positions.
The Ethics Commission was created through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018. The amendment tasks it with regulating ethical behavior in areas relating to elections, lobbying, corruption and transparency.
Commissioners’ duties include adopting ethics rules, investigating alleged violations and issuing advisory opinions to help public officials navigate ethical issues. They are paid a stipend for every day they meet, plus reimbursement for travel.

In this Sept. 24, 2025, image, Kelly speaks to Kansans during gathering in Johnson County. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly took an extraordinary step Friday by filing a lawsuit directly with the Kansas Supreme Court alleging Attorney General Kris Kobach was undermining constitutional powers assigned to the state’s governor.
Kelly, a two-term Democrat, said the lawsuit was necessary because the GOP attorney general took the position that he alone determined interests of Kansas when it came to litigation in federal and state courts. The governor said Kobach had failed to defend Kansans against “unlawful” federal overreaches by President Donald Trump.
“Time and again, Attorney General Kobach’s blatant partisanship is on display, harming and embarrassing Kansas,” she said. “While he was quick to sue the previous presidential administration, alleging he would protect Kansans from federal overreach, he has not once followed through on that claim now that the Trump administration has repeatedly done just that.”
Kobach, who filed or joined numerous lawsuits against the administration of President Joe Biden, said Kelly chose Halloween to take unprecedented action to seize control of the state’s litigation agenda. He expressed confidence Kelly wouldn’t prevail in court.
“This is not a close question. Gov. Kelly is wasting the court’s time,” Kobach said. “If the governor wants to run for the office of attorney general, she has the right to do so. But she will need to go to law school first.”
He said Kansas law was “crystal clear regarding who represents the state of Kansas in court and controls what legal positions are taken by the state of Kansas.”
Kelly’s lawsuit requested the state Supreme Court issue an order preventing the attorney general from intruding on a governor’s “supreme executive” power as head of the executive branch. She said the Kansas Constitution should be relied upon by the court to affirm a Kansas governor’s authority to take steps in defense of Kansans without interference from the attorney general’s office.
Kelly said Kobach’s “willful ignorance undermined” her administration’s effort to shield Kansans from harm and protect millions of dollars for essential programs and services.
“If the attorney general refuses to stand up for Kansas, at least Kansans can rest assured knowing that I will,” Kelly said in a statement.
Kelly said she was disturbed Kobach declined to participate in two federal lawsuits. One was filed against the U.S. Department of Agriculture to seek release of congressionally approved emergency funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. SNAP provides food aid to nearly 188,000 adults and children in Kansans.
Meanwhile, the governor joined — despite Kobach’s opposition — a lawsuit seeking to prevent the Trump administration from terminating federal funding to a collection of public health and safety programs. The list of programs included financing to test for lead in schools and child care facilities, environmental cleanup, evaluating the safety of dams and improvements to drinking water.
Kobach, who lost a campaign for governor against Kelly in 2018, has declared he had authority over what litigation the state of Kansas initiated.
In September, a Shawnee County District Court judge threw out a lawsuit filed by Kobach challenging Kelly’s decision to withhold from the Trump administration personal data on thousands of Kansans regarding SNAP. So far, the Kelly administration has refused to comply with federal demands for information on people who applied for or used SNAP in Kansas.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kelly-democrat-lenexa-5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-31 13:04:23.142859

Unless you’re in prison.
The South Dakota Department of Corrections has been rationing its supply of flu vaccines this month in response to a federal government shutdown-related shortage.
The department offers the vaccines at no cost to the 3,800 inmates scattered across the state’s six prison campuses. Last year, spokesman Michael Winder told South Dakota Searchlight, the department administered 1,225 flu shots.
At this point, he wrote in an email the department is “prioritizing high-risk offenders to receive the vaccines.”
Flu shots are not in short supply for the general public, according to spokespersons for Avera and Sanford Health, South Dakota’s two largest health care providers. But the department doesn’t get its shots through them.
Flu deaths rise as anti-vaccine disinformation takes root

Instead, its supplies come from the federal Centers for Disease Control. The shots first come to the state Department of Health, which then distributes them to the Department of Corrections. As of Monday, Health Department spokeswoman Tia Kafka said, the state hadn’t received its entire correctional supply. 
The Health Department doesn’t distribute flu vaccines to any other state facilities, Kafka said. Just corrections.
“Some delays have occurred due to the federal government shutdown, and we are monitoring the situation closely,” Kafka wrote in an email. 
She said the department expects to get the rest of its correctional supply soon, but she didn’t know when.
Kafka’s department also distributes COVID boosters for inmates, which are supplied, like the flu shots, by the CDC. There isn’t a shortage there, though.
The Corrections Department has been impacted in at least one other way by the federal government shutdown, Winder wrote. Correctional officers are typically able to take a National Incident Management System training through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those web-based courses are paused.

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)In Virginia’s House of Delegates District 86, which includes Hampton, York County and all of Poquoson, incumbent Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton, faces a challenge from Democratic nominee Virgil G. Thornton Sr. in a competitive district that has increasingly been targeted by Democrats and shifted from red to purple in recent years. 
With control of the House of Delegates hanging in the balance, both campaigns have emphasized fundraising, voter outreach and key issues including workforce development, education, public safety and reproductive rights. 


Key races: 2025 Virginia House of Delegates elections
• Money, message and momentum define the 89th District race in Chesapeake
• Data centers dominate House District 21 race between Thomas and Gorham
• House District 82 rematch could help decide control of Virginia’s legislature
• In House District 22, candidates tackle data centers, rising costs in race for legislature’s future
• Familiar foes, new stakes: Coyner–Dougherty rematch tests Va.’s suburban swing in House District 75
• Democrat Mehta aims to unseat Republican Earley in Chesterfield-based House District 73 race
• Growth, tourism and turnout collide in House District 71 rematch
• House District 97, anchored in Virginia Beach, could determine party majority in House of Delegates
• Big money, tight margins define Obenshain–Franklin rematch in House District 41


Virginia’s 86th House District encompasses a diverse demographic. The median household income is approximately $86,000, the median age is roughly 38 years old, and around 37% of adults hold a bachelor’s degree or higher. The district reflects a blend of working-class and middle-income voters whose priorities often center on affordability, workforce opportunity and commuting time. 
In 2024, Kamala Harris narrowly carried the district over Donald Trump by just 1.1 percentage points, while U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine won it by less than 3 points against Republican Hung Cao. As of Oct. 23, Thornton had outraised Cordoza $2.47 million to $634,543, signaling that Democrats view House District 86 as a potential pickup opportunity in a narrowly divided chamber.
The race intensified in the final stretch leading up to Election Day, after Thornton released an advertisement calling Cordoza a “dangerous predator,” a claim the Republican has denied repeatedly and denounced in a sit-down TV interview.
 A.C. Cordoza

Cordoza was first elected in 2021 and has served two terms in the House of Delegates. He ran unsuccessfully for Hampton City Council in 2020. Before entering elected office, Cordoza served in the U.S. Air Force from 2013 to 2016 and later worked in cybersecurity at Newport News Shipbuilding. Cordoza declined to be interviewed for this story.
His committee assignments in the 2025 General Assembly include the House Public Safety Committee, the House Courts of Justice Committee (Criminal Subcommittee), and the Communications, Technology and Innovation Committee. 
According to his website, Cordoza’s stated platform emphasizes support for working-class families, technical education, small business growth and keeping Virginia’s cost of living low. He opposes tax increases and supports returning state budget surpluses to taxpayers. He also highlights career and technical education as central to workforce development, noting alternative pathways for students who struggle in traditional public school settings. 
Cordoza backs higher pay for law enforcement officers and continued funding to combat human trafficking. On Second Amendment issues, he is a strong proponent of gun rights, arguing law-abiding citizens should retain access to firearms while promoting voluntary safety and education initiatives. 
His environmental platform includes pushes for clean air, oyster restoration efforts and support for offshore wind. He has also emphasized veterans’ issues, drawing on his military experience to advocate for mental health support and affordable housing for veterans and military families. 
Cordoza’s record includes a 2023 re-election victory in District 86, when he won with 56.3% of the vote to Democrat Jarris Louis Taylor Jr.’s 43.5%. On policy positions, he voted against allowing voters to decide by referendum on a constitutional amendment to protect reproductive rights, and against requiring safe storage of firearms in households with minors.
According to campaign finance reports, Cordoza has raised over $634,000. Since Sept. 22, Pro-Cordoza or Anti-Thornton political ad spending has reached about $253,771. 
 Virgil G. Thornton Sr.

Virgil G. Thornton Sr., the Democratic challenger in District 86, brings a background rooted in workforce development and small-business leadership. He served as a technician in the U.S. Navy’s submarine program after entering shipyard apprenticeship training. He describes himself as an executive coach and community advocate who works with at-risk youth and small-business mentorship programs. Thornton declined to be interviewed for this story.
His latest campaign finance reports show Thornton has raised nearly $2.5 million and is entering the final days of the race with over $170,000 in cash on hand. Anti-Cordoza political ad spending tops $1.4 million. 
As someone who did not attend college, Thornton’s campaign emphasizes that college should not be the only path to success. He advocates for strengthened apprenticeship and technical training programs that link schools with local employers in trades such as shipbuilding, firefighting and criminal justice. He strongly opposes diverting public funds to private or religious schools and contends that public dollars should stay in public schools. 
Thornton supports increasing teacher pay and state per-student funding in divisions that fall below national averages. 
On gun safety, he supports mandatory training and licensing requirements for firearm ownership, comparing the process to obtaining a driver’s license. 
On reproductive rights, Thornton backs the state’s in-progress constitutional amendment to protect access to abortion and contraception, stating on his website that decisions about pregnancy and contraception are part of health care and “should be left to women, families, and their doctors.” He also supports automatic restoration of voting rights for people who have completed their sentences and argues against efforts to restrict access to Medicaid or other health programs. 
Thornton’s campaign positions emphasize economic opportunity and stability. In an interview with the Virginia Independent, he said it is “time out for the chaos and time to get back to community,” focusing on affordability, jobs and local opportunity. He argues small businesses are a major employer in Virginia and supports targeted grants, tax credits and mentorship for small firms. He also voiced concern about health care costs and economic uncertainty driven by federal policy changes and tariffs. 
Thornton’s campaign has also attracted attention for a controversial advertisement released Sept. 17, which cited several past police reports and incidents involving Cordoza, saying he has a “long history of predatory behavior.” 
A fact-check by WAVY-TV 10’s 10 On Your Side reviewed the ad’s claims and confirmed that Cordoza was charged in 2017 with misdemeanor brandishing of a firearm during a traffic dispute with a retired state trooper. However, court records show he was later found not guilty. The same review found that other incidents cited in the ad were based on police reports in which Cordoza was listed as the victim, but no charges were ever filed against him. 
Cordoza has since denied any wrongdoing, calling the advertisement “false” and saying the materials were taken out of context from his teenage years and early adulthood. On Oct. 6, he posted a video on social media featuring Nichole Melvin, a woman described as a “victim of Virgil Thornton’s false ad,” who said she regretted what she had previously said about Cordoza. 
The exchange has fueled tensions in an already competitive race, with both campaigns accusing the other of negative or misleading tactics. Despite the controversy, both candidates have continued to focus on policy: Thornton on economic opportunity and apprenticeships, and Cordoza on parental rights, small-business growth, and tax relief.
Voters will decide which man will represent the district in the House of Delegates on Election Day, Nov. 4.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas will distribute $500,000 among six regional food bank networks in the state, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday, as  SNAP benefits are set to stop on Nov. 1.
Sanders also said she would consider additional weekly allocations from Arkansas’ restricted reserve funds if the federal government shutdown continues past next week. In a press release, she said the chairs of the Arkansas Legislative Council granted emergency approval to release the funds.
The announcement comes as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is set to stop paying benefits on Nov. 1 as a result of the ongoing federal shutdown and the Trump administration’s refusal to use emergency funds to continue paying program recipients.
Arkansas warns SNAP interruptions possible; urges preparation

The decision by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the decades-old food assistance program, sparked nationwide, bipartisan concerns and a scramble by food banks, nonprofits, and state and local governments to prepare for a surge in need by low-income Americans when the funds dry up.
The funds directed to Arkansas food bank networks won’t replace SNAP benefits. The federal government paid out more than $41 million in SNAP benefits to Arkansans in May alone, according to initial data from the USDA.
Republican governors and legislators in Virginia and Louisiana have already loosened their states’ purse strings to pay out benefits in November, with Louisiana preparing to spend upwards of $150 million a month to keep the program afloat during the funding lapse.
The federal government has traditionally covered the full cost of SNAP benefits and split the costs of administering the program with states.
Sanders, who frequently touts her record on addressing childhood food insecurity in public appearances, blamed Senate Democrats for the shutdown in a written statement.
“What Senate Democrats are doing is unconscionable, playing political games with the food assistance that nearly a quarter million Arkansans rely on,” Sanders said. “The simplest, fastest solution remains for Democrats to reopen the government and fund programs like SNAP, but in the meantime, my administration will work with our legislators, churches, and food banks to help feed Arkansans.”
Senate Republicans and Democrats remained deadlocked on funding the government as of Friday.
The food banks that will receive equal portions of the the funds are:

Northwest Arkansas Food Bank at Springdale
Food Bank of North Central Arkansas at Norfolk
Food Bank of Northeast Arkansas at Jonesboro
River Valley Regional Food Bank at Fort Smith
Arkansas Foodbank at Little Rock
Harvest Regional Food Bank at Texarkana

Sanders said HelpArkansas.com “will direct Arkansans to food assistance resources throughout the state and will be updated as the government shutdown continues.”
Those wanting to donate food or time to Arkansans in need can find information on the same website, as well as the websites of each of the food banks linked above.
 ‘No way we can hold the line’ 
Kate Jenkins, director of marketing and communications for Arkansas Foodbank, expressed gratitude for the roughly $83,000 her organization will receive from the pot of money, saying it would allow them to purchase “the first couple truckloads” of the 12 to 13 additional trucks of food they believe they will need.
“It’s definitely a great starting point,” she said.
But the looming SNAP cutoff is already having effects. Food banks in their 33-county service area saw the number of first-time visitors increase 10% to 20% “just this week, in preparation for the possibility that SNAP benefits won’t get funded,” Jenkins said.
Arkansas Foodbank is happy to help anyone hungry as a result of the federal shutdown. “That is our prerogative. That is our mission. That is our job,” Jenkins said. “However, comma, we already serve 280,000 Arkansans, just as the Arkansas Food Bank.”
With the shutdown, there are now between 15,000 to 20,000 federal workers in the food bank’s area without paychecks — and roughly 49% of the state’s approximately 240,000 SNAP enrollees are within Arkansas Foodbank’s service area as well, she said.
The SNAP interruption means many of those people will be looking to get assistance elsewhere.
“We are conservatively estimating that there will be an increase of 100,000 people on top of the 300,000 we’re currently serving” as a result of SNAP payments not going out, Jenkins said. “There’s just no way that we can hold the line as the charitable food system.”
Jenkins said those wishing to help can learn how to donate food or volunteer on Arkansas Foodbank’s website.
“A lot of these pantries are going to have a spike in first time visitors specifically, but just in traffic in general,” she said. “For every $1 that is donated to the food bank, we can provide five meals.”
Kent Eikenberry, the president and CEO of Northwest Arkansas Food Bank, said in an email that the money from the state “comes at a very opportune time.”
While he couldn’t speak for other food banks, Eikenberry said the funds would be used to assist their partner agencies, purchase additional food for mobile and school pantries and stock up on low-stock items.
But Eikenberry said while the funds are “appreciated, it does not negate the fact that for every meal we distribute, SNAP generates nine meals.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5213-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-31 13:04:23.142859

The race for governor

Michigan Secretary of State and gubernatorial candidate Jocelyn Benson reported raising $1.2 million in the period running from July 21, 2025 to Oct. 20, 2025, bringing her total fundraising to over $4.7 million, which her campaign said was “more than any other Democratic gubernatorial candidate in an open seat at this point in the cycle.” She ended the reporting period with just under $3 million in cash on hand.
Her main rival for the Democratic nomination, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, who has raised more than $1.1 million since launching his campaign, reported raising nearly $360,000 in that same time frame, ending the reporting period with more than $370,000 cash on hand.
Also in the hunt for the Democratic nod is Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, who raised more than $295,000 in the most recent reporting period, bringing his fundraising total to $1.3 million. He ended the period with over $385,000 cash on hand.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a lifelong Democrat now seeking an independent run for governor, announced Monday that his campaign had raised more than $1.17 million in the third quarter, leaving him with more than $2.46 million cash on hand. His campaign said the numbers were “a clear sign of growing support for his independent run.”
Not so fast, said the Democratic Governors Association, which released a memo Monday questioning Duggan’s viability as a candidate, and pointing to previous reporting that “a sizable share” of the mayor’s campaign fundraising “comes from donors of President Donald Trump, GOP party leaders, and conservative power brokers”.
Over on the GOP side, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox reported the biggest war chest, with nearly $3.8 million in cash on hand for his gubernatorial bid, although that includes a $2 million loan he made to his own campaign, which as the Detroit Free Press noted brought the “total he has lent his own campaign to over $3.5 million.”
Also seeking the Republican nod is U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), who raised just under $1.4 million during the July 21, 2025 to Oct. 20, 2025 fundraising period, bringing his total fundraising to more than $3.6 million since the start of his campaign and leaving him with nearly $2.3 million cash on hand.
Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) reported more than $2.1 million cash on hand as of Oct. 20, including $420,000 raised in the most recent fundraising period, which brings his total raised to over $2.7 million.
Ralph Rebandt, who is the newest entrant to the GOP race (he also ran for governor in 2022), reported raising almost $927,000 between July 21, 2025 and Oct. 20, 2025, although that includes $800,000 in loans he made to his own campaign. He ends the period with over $880,000 cash on hand.
Meanwhile, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard (R-DeWitt), raised more than $290,000 in the period, leaving him with just over $700,000 cash on hand. While he has raised over $930,000 in total, that includes a $105,000 loan he gave his own campaign.

On this year’s ballot for mayor, Democrat Justin Elicker is running for reelection against Republican Steve Orosco. 
Elicker, who is currently serving his third 2-year term as mayor, is seeking a fourth term. But beginning next year, mayoral terms in New Haven will be extended to four years. The Democrat is also endorsed by the Working Families party. 
Orosco, who is hoping to become the first Republican mayor of New Haven since 1953, is also endorsed by the Independent Party.

(photo: Ahmed Jallow /NC Newsline)Inside the Urban Ministries of Wake County’s food pantry on Thursday morning, volunteers slid boxes of pasta and cans of vegetables into brown paper bags, the day’s rations for families waiting outside in a line of cars that wrapped around the building.
Outside, pantry manager Jerry Leslie moved from car to car with a clipboard, checking names and employment status as volunteers hustled to keep pace. The line has grown in recent weeks, he said, a sign of rising need as the federal shutdown unsettles families across North Carolina.
“We’ve got a lot of furloughed workers coming through,” Leslie said. “A lot of truck drivers are starting to come through the line, too.”
The morning before, he noticed a woman typing on her laptop while she waited. “I asked about her situation, and she told me she’s employed but not getting paid.”
As the shutdown stretches into its fourth week, food pantries like Urban Ministry have become a vital safety net for furloughed workers and low-income households bracing for impending disruptions to federal food assistance.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program still has funding, but benefits will halt this weekend if the Trump administration does not authorize emergency USDA reserves. The agency has said it will not do so.
On Tuesday, North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined several states in suing the U.S. Department of Agriculture, seeking to compel the release of reserve funds to continue SNAP benefits in November. The lawsuit aims to protect food assistance for 1.4 million North Carolinians, including about 580,000 children.
On Thursday, Gov. Josh Stein announced that the state and private donors are sending $18 million to North Carolina food banks to help. However, that’s just a fraction of the $230 to $250 million SNAP benefits pump into the state every month.
If payments pause for long, food aid groups warn they will not be able to meet the surge in need.
“We used to serve between 80 and 100 people a day,” Leslie said. “Now we’re seeing at least 200 daily.”
Sitting in his car, Theodore Robinson, 78, said the looming threat of cuts worries him and his neighbors. “It’ll affect the very essence of our lives — everyone who depends on these programs,” he said.
Franklin County mom Rebecca Cuering is also worried about what the coming disruption will mean for her family. 
When stagehand work comes through, she takes it. At home, she raises her 6-year-old son while caring for her 78-year-old mother, who has dementia, and her brother, a veteran. Their well barely produces clean water, so part of her SNAP benefits goes toward buying it by the gallon.
Before she qualified for SNAP, she fell behind on utilities and her car was repossessed. The benefits, she said, have given her just enough breathing room to keep the lights on and begin rebuilding. 
“Since getting SNAP, I’ve been able to start catching up on bills,” Cuering said. “Without it, I don’t know what we’d do — probably start asking strangers for help.”
Inside the food pantry, the shelves remain stocked for now, but staff worry that a shutdown could quickly change that. 
The Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides about 70% of Urban Ministries’ monthly supplies, distributes staples like canned vegetables, beans, rice, applesauce, and usually three types of meat.
But with the shutdown, even that lifeline is  at risk. Recent deliveries have arrived short, particularly on protein. “The last order we had, we didn’t get any meat,” Leslie said.
To fill some of the gap, Urban Ministries has turned to local partners, scheduled six community food drives for November, and is using its limited funds to stock the pantry.
“It’s going to be cutting it close,” Leslie said.
Even so, he expects they will make it through the end of the year. “We have a good base of support. We’re just trying to keep up with the need.”
Jessica N. Holmes, former state auditor and executive director of Urban Ministries of Wake County, recalled growing up reliant on free lunch, pantries, and SNAP benefits. 
“Even though North Carolina is known for agriculture, too many of our neighbors still go hungry,” Holmes said in a statement. “With the government shutdown, things can go from bad to worse very quickly for hard-working families and children.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s top state government budget official warned Thursday that the current budget cycle “is playing out to be another belt-tightening year.”
Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger spoke during a Governor’s Council of Economic Advisors meeting.
“We probably just have to take a cautious approach as we move forward, given some of the circumstances that we’re in right now,” Terwilliger said. 
Through September, the state’s general fund revenue was 2.5% below the budgeted projection, which meant revenue was $17.4 million less than expected. Derek Johnson, the bureau’s state economist, said the bureau is anxiously awaiting October tax collection reports. Sales taxes were $6.1 million below estimates through September.
Johnson pointed to numbers indicating slower spending despite rising personal income, and cited weak consumer sentiment — a measure of consumers’ attitude and confidence about the economy and their personal finances — and higher prices as part of the explanation. 
The farm sector is another drag on state revenue. Taxable sales of farm machinery fell 21% in fiscal year 2025 and were down about 20% in the first three months of the state’s fiscal year 2026, which began in July. Corn, soybeans and wheat prices are all lower than last year, although cattle prices are up. 
Council members from around the state reported uneven conditions. Sioux Falls City Finance Director Shawn Pritchett said the city will miss its sales tax revenue estimate and has already cut $6 million in ongoing expenses, with fee hikes on the table to help account for the remaining $4 million shortfall. He said the city is seeing softer restaurant traffic ticket sales and hotel occupancy.
Rapid City is benefitting from a boom tied to the Ellsworth Air Force Base expansion (construction is underway to accommodate the impending arrival of new B-21 bomber planes) and continued migration into the Black Hills. City sales tax collections are up just over 3% this calendar year. However, “that number just tracks with inflation,” said Marnie Herrmann, chief banking officer at Security First Bank in Rapid City.
Retailers are bracing for a lean holiday season. Kevin Nyberg of Nyberg’s Ace Hardware, which has locations in Sioux Falls and Watertown, said national surveys suggest the average household plans to spend about $1,600 less on Christmas gifts this year. He hopes discounts, rewards and rebate programs will drive traffic.
“Call it a gimmick, call it a marketing ploy — either way, it works,” he said.
Carla Gatzke of Daktronics, an electronic display manufacturer based in Brookings, flagged tariff impacts, child care cost and eligibility, and workforce shortages as key issues in the Brookings regional economy. South Dakota’s unemployment rate sits at 1.9% — the lowest in the nation — with roughly three job openings per unemployed worker.

It is a statement. It’s about honoring the roots of America’s music and culture.""","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

It is with great pride and excitement that Mississippi’s Capital City prepares to host the 82nd Annual National Folk Festival, Nov.  7-9. This is significant in the life of the National Folk Festival because it marks the first time in the history of the event that it has been held in the Deep South.
November also marks the beginning of a three-year residency for Jackson. The event also will be hosted in Jackson in 2026 and 2027.
At the conclusion of the 2027 festival, the Jackson community will have the opportunity to create a legacy that will sustain a vibrant, locally-produced festival celebrating our living heritage, utilizing the infrastructure of the National Folk Festival.   
For years, citizens and visitors alike have inquired, “When is Jubilee JAM! returning?” Well, hosting the National Folk Festival creates an opportunity to birth an annual event with many similarities to that historic and enduring event.
Why does the National Folk Festival matter?
For over 90 years, the National Folk Festival has celebrated the artistry, music, dance, story and crafts that form the living traditions of America. We are honored to bring this storied festival to Jackson. The 2026 festival will play an integral role in the American 250 (Mississippi) Celebration.

The National Folk Festival is more than a festival. It is a statement. It’s about honoring the roots of America’s music and culture, from the Mississippi Delta to the Gulf Coast, from African-American traditions to Native American crafts and beyond.
Everybody knows that Mississippi is the Birthplace of America’s Music. Also, it is about a place known as “The City with Soul” stepping into the national spotlight and celebrating what makes us unique. It’s about doing so together. We at Visit Jackson call it “collective ambition.”
What Is folk?
Folk is a cultural tradition from all across America.  It’s Bobby Rush, bluegrass, steel guitars, gospel and Jackson State University’s Sonic Boom of the South marching band. It is western dance, South African qawwali, the Korean Performing Arts Institute of Chicago and E.U. and their hit from my college days, “Da Butt.” It is basketmaking and multiple other activities. 
Over three days, downtown Jackson will be transformed. More than 300 artists, musicians, dancers and storytellers will grace multiple stages, with continuous performances, craft demonstrations, food representing regional and international traditions, a bustling marketplace of folklife and family-friendly programming.
From blues and bluegrass to hip-hop and Irish fiddle, from Choctaw social dancing to South Asian qawwali, there is something for everyone. 
The event reinforces the commitment to accessibility, sustainability, community and cultural celebration.
Hosting the National Folk Festival isn’t only about the arts. It’s about the broader impact on our city and state. Over the three-year run, the festival is projected to generate significant economic benefit and elevate Jackson’s standing as a cultural destination.
It will bring tens of thousands of visitors, fill our hotels, restaurants and shops, and spotlight our region’s talents on a national stage.
Jackson is uniquely positioned to host the event.
Mississippi is rightly known as the birthplace of so much of America’s music: blues, gospel, soul, marching bands and traditions that shaped the world. Jackson is located at the heart of that legacy, and we are perfectly positioned to host a festival of this magnitude.
The city of Jackson, Visit Jackson, the Greater Jackson Chamber Partnership, the Mississippi Arts Commission, Visit Mississippi, the Jackson Redevelopment Authority, Hinds County Economic Development Authority, the Community Foundation for Mississippi and many others have come together to make this possible.
Far too many times I have heard metro Jacksonians say that there is nothing to do here. And while that is far from the truth, I encourage our residents, families, friends and visitors to attend this historic event. Bring your children, grandparents and friends.
Walk the streets of downtown Jackson, enjoy the music, sample the food, browse the crafts and celebrate the diversity of tradition that binds us together. Volunteer opportunities are available, vendor applications are open, and the festival is a platform for our local artists and makers to shine. 
Will the festival be safe?
The festival is produced by a respected national organization, the National Council for the Traditional Arts, in partnership with the city and local agencies, which suggests there will be professional event planning, crowd management, security coordination and infrastructure.
In fact, local and state law enforcement agencies have been a part of the planning process since the event selected Jackson.
The location and staging have been intentionally strategic. Multiple stages and programs have been planned in an open public space, utilizing proven event safety best practices.
We encourage attendees to review the event map before arrival so that they can more easily locate venues, vendors and stages. Also, know where you will park. The event organizers have this type of information and much more on the website, www.nationalfolkfestival.com.
Thank you for being part of this journey. I look forward to seeing you downtown in Jackson, Nov. 7-9, tapping your toes, dancing, exploring and celebrating –  together.
In short, enjoy the National Folk Festival in Jackson, Mississippi – MY CITY –  THE CITY WITH SOUL.

New benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will not be issued beginning Nov. 1 due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, the Mississippi Department of Human Services announced Oct. 24. Food assistance has continued to flow in past shutdowns, but the federal government has said it cannot use emergency funds to pay for the program. 
Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has not indicated that he will move for Mississippi to bridge the gap in the food assistance program. Democratic and Republican governors in a handful of other states, including Louisiana, have pledged to use state funds to cover all or part of the program.
There will be long-term consequences for children if Reeves and state legislators do not take similar steps to fund the benefits, leaders of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote in a Tuesday letter. 
“The cost of inaction will be far greater than the cost of temporary assistance,” said the letter penned by President Dr. Patricia Tibbs and Vice President Dr. David Reeves. 
“Families already struggling to make ends meet will be forced to choose between food, utilities, and medicine. Hospitals and clinics will inevitably bear the burden of increased malnutrition and preventable illness. Our children, the future of this state, will suffer the most.”

Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus Chairman Kabir Karriem, a Democrat from Columbus, encouraged Reeves to declare a state of emergency and call a special session of the Legislature to appropriate funds to cover the shortfall. 
“Ensuring that no Mississippian faces hunger due to gaps in SNAP delivery is a critical public health and humanitarian priority,” he wrote in a letter Tuesday. 
Reeves did not respond to a request for comment from Mississippi Today.
In a social media post Monday, he blamed Democrats for the government shutdown’s ramifications and said the state cannot cover the halted funds. 
“Democrats in Washington are evidently more interested in providing free healthcare to illegals than a safety net for poor Mississippians,” he wrote. 
“They evidently hate Trump more than they like their constituents. There is sadly no simple way for state government to just step in and pay the hundreds of millions of dollars in harm that this shutdown by the Washington Democrats is causing.”
The battle over whether or not to extend expiring tax credits that make health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans is at the heart of the government shutdown standoff, with Democrats pushing for their renewal, along with the reversal of cuts to Medicaid. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for the subsidies, nor are they eligible for full Medicaid benefits.  
Nearly 400,000 Mississippians — or 13% of the state’s population — receive food assistance through SNAP. Two thirds of participants are in families with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. 
Mississippi has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the nation, with over 1 in 5 children living in poverty and lacking reliable access to food.  
“I’m really worried,” Tibbs told Mississippi Today. She referenced the effects that hunger can have on children’s development, behavior, academic performance and long-term health. 
Some counties rely heavily on SNAP benefits. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT. 
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 as Congress works to strike a deal on the national budget. It is now the second-longest government shutdown in U.S. history.
More than two dozen states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over the halted food assistance benefits, arguing that the decision was illegal and will harm the 42 million Americans who depend on the benefits. 
Federal officials say they are legally prohibited from extending the benefits by using emergency funds.
“No child in our state should go hungry because of political gridlock in Washington,” Tibbs and Reeves, the pediatrics association’s vice president, wrote in the Oct. 28 letter. 
SNAP beneficiaries in Mississippi must meet income and resource limits, and most able-bodied adults must also meet work requirements. 
New work requirements for SNAP are set to begin next month as a result of federal budget legislation President Donald Trump signed into law last summer. The law increases the existing work requirement’s upper age limit from 54 to 65 and extends the requirement to people who were previously exempt: veterans, those facing homelessness, and young people aging out of foster care. There is still a caregiver exemption, but parents must have children younger than 14 — down from 18. 
Even in the best of times, many Mississippi families aren’t able to provide healthy meals for their kids, said Tibbs. A pause to SNAP could be devastating. 
“I just hope that the state sees the crisis that’s looming for our vulnerable citizens and that they do something to extend benefits for as long as we can,” she said. 
“We need to have said in the future that we tried, we tried to do the things we need to do for the children in our state, regardless of what’s happening in Washington, D.C.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30123917/Mississippi-Economic-Council-annual-Hobnob16B.jpg,,,2025-10-31 12:03:06.124374

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Delays in the sale of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, have led the owner of both hospitals to propose two new alternatives: transferring the facilities to state ownership, or closing them.
In a motion filed in federal bankruptcy court Thursday, attorneys for Prospect Medical Holdings sought court permission for its new backup plan. The LA-based hospital chain operator, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January, had hoped to onload its Rhode Island facilities onto a new, nonprofit owner. But prospective buyer The Centurion Foundation still can’t sell the bonds needed to finance its purchase, and Prospect has had enough.
“Now, more than eight months after approval of the Centurion Sale, and six months after that promised closing date, the Debtors can no longer afford to fund the RI Hospitals on the hope that Centurion may finally obtain adequate financing to close the Centurion Sale,” states the motion filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for The Centurion Foundation, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Friday.
The 346-page document includes a tranche of exhibits documenting the history of the drawn-out sale, from the initial, conditional approval by state regulators in June 2024, to the series of revisions granted to ease the financial terms of the transaction. Centurion has struggled to secure investors to back the $150 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds needed to finalize its purchase amid unfavorable credit ratings and a bleak outlook for health care facilities nationwide under federal budget cuts.
Despite these obstacles, proponents, including Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, insist that the Atlanta-based nonprofit is the best hope for saving the critical, safety net hospitals from closure. 
“Given the developments over the past few weeks, we are not surprised by this development and have been preparing for it,” Neronha said in an emailed response Friday. “We will oppose this motion in court in the coming days and will continue to do everything we can to keep these hospitals open and operating for the foreseeable future.”
However, Neronha’s office has refused Prospect’s request to repurpose $51.5 million already held in escrow for hospital operations to cover Prospect’s losses, according to the court document. The escrow account was set up in 2021, paid for by private equity firm Leonard Green as part of its exit from the local hospitals ownership.
Neronha has remained insistent that the money remain available for hospital operations, while blasting the corporate owners for financial mismanagement.
But Prospect, which continues to face short-term cash flow woes as its assets are sold off through federal bankruptcy proceedings to pay its creditors, can’t afford to keep waiting. The six-month delay in closing has caused the company to incur an additional $18.7 million in losses, with another $6 million loss by the end of November, the motion states.
“The Debtors cannot continue to operate the RI Hospitals indefinitely,” the motion states. “Continued operations at these facilities past December 31, 2025 would risk further administrative insolvency of these chapter 11 cases. It is particularly inequitable to burden the Debtors’ creditors with these losses under the current circumstances, where the Debtors will receive little, if any, consideration from the transfer of these assets.”
It seeks a federal bankruptcy judge’s permission to start the process to transfer the hospitals to state ownership or to begin their “orderly closure.” 
The company has proposed a Dec. 31 closure date, noting that it will adjust the end of clinical operations ‘if necessary to ensure safe patient care.”
The closure plan also details the timing of layoff notices for the 2,400 affected employees and patient discharges, along with transferring and storing medical records and getting rid of medical waste and hazardous materials.
The two hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, equal to more than 20% of behavioral health beds. They accounted for more 50,000 emergency room visits in 2024.

Former Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Steven Harpe approved a million-dollar deal with a private vendor in early April to install AI call monitoring software in seven state prisons.
Months later, he resigned from state service and took a job with that company.
On Oct. 3, Harpe posted on LinkedIn that he had accepted the position of chief product officer at LEO Technologies, an Austin, Texas-based artificial intelligence company that caters to law enforcement and corrections officials. More than 80 people, including two Board of Corrections members, responded to the post wishing Harpe congratulations. Harpe also shared news of the job change on Facebook.
Six months earlier, on April 3, Harpe authorized a one-year, $1.017 million deal with LEO Technologies. Agency officials gave final approval to the contract, which includes four one-year renewal options, on April 8. The contract stipulates that LeoTech will “assign designated personnel to support Oklahoma DOC operations.”
Harpe announced his resignation in late August, effective Sept. 30. The announcement stated that he was leaving state service to rejoin the private sector but did not specify which company. Typically, if the company is in business with the state, such a move would require a one-year cooling off period.
Oklahoma statutes stipulate that a state officer or employee who exercises discretion or decision-making authority in awarding a privatization contract is prohibited from becoming an employee of that business or organization within one year of the contract award date. Penalties for violating the statute include the cancellation of contracts and a temporary prohibition on doing business with the state.
The Legislature passed the law in 1999 to stop a revolving door of state officials leaving to work for private vendors. In 2009, lawmakers updated the statute to include sanctions for businesses that hire an involved state employee.
Lee Ann Bruce Boone, executive director of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, said enforcement of the statute likely falls with the attorney general’s office. Leslie Berger, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, declined to comment on whether the matter is under investigation, citing an internal agency policy.
Abegail Cave, director of communications for Gov. Kevin Stitt, said people within the governor’s office were unaware of Harpe’s employment plans upon leaving state service. She declined to comment on the law requiring a cooling off period. Harpe was the second Department of Corrections director appointed by Stitt following a 2019 law change that transferred power to appoint the agency’s director from the Board of Corrections to the governor’s office.
Bob Burke, an Oklahoma City-based attorney and historian, said Harpe’s signature on the contract should concern taxpayers.
“It’s a sad day in this state when directors of agencies even recommend the award of a contract and months later go to work for that same company,” Burke said. “The appearance stinks. That kind of self-dealing should be frowned upon by the people and by the governor and legislative leaders who appoint members to the Board of Corrections.”
Harpe did not respond to phone calls, a text message or an email seeking comment. LEO Technologies did not respond to a phone call or written inquiry.
Harpe, who worked as the chief information officer for Gov. Kevin Stitt’s Gateway Mortgage Group prior to entering state government in 2019, regularly promoted the Department of Corrections’ artificial intelligence initiatives in media interviews and at out-of-state conferences.
In July, he traveled to Washington, D.C., to represent the American Correctional Association at a congressional briefing on AI in public safety. At the hearing, Harpe touted broad AI implementation efforts within the Department of Corrections.
“What if I was able to take that labor and instead of using people to do it, I was using facial recognition AI, not just one time, but use it all the time,” Harpe said during the briefing. “I always know where they are. You get logistics of who’s talking to who. Technology now exists where you can look at a body in real time and tell if they’re carrying something, if you have something stowed somewhere on you. It also lets us do really cool things like suicide prevention.”
Harpe earned $275,000 per year in his role as agency director, comparable to top prison officials in larger states like Texas. Stitt has defended the salary as necessary to recruit and retain the best and brightest from the private sector to work in state government.

Patrol investigators cited him after investigating an allegation by a woman attending a sine die party often attended by staff, family and friends of legislators, Patrol Public Relations Director Cody Thomas confirmed to the Nebraska Examiner.

The Patrol received a report in early September about an alleged incident in the evening hours of May 29 at Lincoln Country Club. That is the same time and location that lawmakers attended the first of two post-legislative session sine die parties.
“An adult female reported that Dan McKeon had made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” Thomas said in response to a reporter’s questions about the incident.
Thomas said the State Patrol issued McKeon a citation for public indecency — a Class II misdemeanor — Thursday afternoon. The allegation was forwarded to Lancaster County Attorney Pat Condon’s office, which had no immediate comment.
McKeon’s office declined to comment on the allegations Friday morning, and he did not answer a call to his cell phone.
McKeon was elected to the Nebraska Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon has been married for 30 years and has four children, according to McKeon’s biographical page on the Nebraska Legislature’s website.
During his first session in office, McKeon passed two bills to ease agricultural regulations and has another bill pending that aims to protect veterans from “predatory claim sharks.”

The Examiner is not naming the woman making the allegation, because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to name people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly. Her lawyer declined to comment Friday morning.
People around the Capitol have been talking for months about an alleged incident involving someone who works for the Legislature.
On Oct. 20, State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha posted on social media in response to a comment criticizing her that the Legislature doesn’t “have an ‘ethics committee,’ and if we did, my colleague who grabbed a staffers ass at an event a few months ago would have resigned already.”
As of midmorning Friday, no resignation letters from a member of the Legislature had been received by the legislative or executive offices that would expect them.
Gov. Jim Pillen, through a spokesperson, had no immediate comment.
McKeon is expected in Lancaster County Court Dec. 10, authorities said.

The Iowa Board of Nursing has charged 48-year-old Andrea Marie Meisinger, formerly of Altoona, Ankeny and Grimes, with professional incompetence and with having her nursing license sanctioned by other jurisdictions.
While the board has not disclosed any information as to what led to the charges, regulators in other states have publicly detailed a long history of alleged violations related to Meisinger prescribing weight-loss drugs to patients in states where she wasn’t authorized to do so.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Meisinger’s licensing troubles began in October 2018 when she — then known as Andrea Richey and Andrea Althaus — surrendered her Iowa license as an advanced registered nurse practitioner after being accused of prescribing controlled substances to people with whom she had no provider-patient relationship and with using a prescription pad she obtained from a previous employer.
In February 2020, the Iowa board agreed to reinstate Meisinger’s license subject to one year of probation.
Nebraska, South Dakota and other states take action
In May 2024, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services’ Division of Public Health charged Meisinger with several regulatory violations, including gross incompetence or negligence, unprofessional conduct, immoral or dishonorable conduct, and having had her license sanctioned in the states of Georgia, Texas, Florida and New Mexico.
The Nebraska division alleged that Meisinger had placed on Facebook a set of advertisements for weight-loss drugs. A prospective patient allegedly contacted Meisinger through Facebook Messenger and received in return a pricing schedule and an assurance that no medical appointment or consultation was needed to receive the drugs.
Meisinger later invoiced the patient $2,700 for a six-month supply of the drugs, although the patient canceled the order before it was fulfilled, the division alleged.
As a result of the disciplinary charges, Meisinger agreed in July 2024 to pay a $3,000 civil penalty and have her Nebraska license suspended for 90 days followed by a period of probation.
In September 2024, the state of South Dakota sent Meisinger a cease-and-desist order, alleging she was unlawfully practicing without a license in that state. Meisinger’s Iowa license, however, remained in good standing, authorizing her to continue working in Iowa as both an ARNP and RN.
In November 2024, Nebraska’s Division of Public Health filed new charges against Meisinger seeking the immediate suspension of her license because “her continued practice would constitute an imminent danger to public health and safety.”
The division alleged that after her July 2024 suspension took effect, Meisinger, as the CEO and advanced registered nurse practitioner at AR Virtual Health in Omaha, had begun prescribing weight-loss drugs to additional patients in states where she was not authorized to do so, such as California, New York, Illinois, Idaho, Kansas, Washington and other states.
The division also alleged Meisinger was prescribing medications for various patients by having the drugs delivered to her home address or to the Iowa addresses of employees or associates.
‘We don’t want a lot of people snooping around in here’
The Nebraska division also alleged that in September 2024, after one of Meisinger’s employees at AR Virtual Health resigned, Meisinger had a phone conference with the worker and stated, “If people start investigating this … we don’t want a lot of people snooping around in here … Your name is on every single chart.”
Meisinger, the division alleges, also told the former employee she was considering offering the individual a severance package and specifically asked the worker not to file a report against her.
“I’m just asking to please not do anything in haste in making decisions right now,” Meisinger allegedly told the worker. “I want to make it right with you. And that doesn’t mean just smoothing things over with a few words. It means taking care of you financially.”
At around that same time, the Nebraska division claimed, Meisinger was advertising on Facebook that she could provide patients “in all 50 states” with prescription-only weight loss medications.
As a result of the allegations, the Nebraska division revoked Meisinger’s probation and scheduled a hearing to again suspend her nursing license in that state. Within days, Meisinger agreed to a revocation of her Nebraska ARNP and RN licenses and also agreed to pay a $16,000 civil penalty.
New allegations surface while Iowa license remains in effect
In March 2025, with her Iowa license still in good standing, the Nebraska division again took action against Meisinger, this time issuing a cease-and-desist order related to her alleged ongoing efforts to provide nursing services in Nebraska despite her license revocation.
The division alleged that on her AR Virtual Health website and on social-media platforms, Meisinger was continuing to offer consultation on “detox” and supplements to individuals in all 50 states.
“These advertisements and comments make it clear that you are holding yourself out as a nurse practitioner and are operating a business to do so,” the division claimed, warning that continued violations could result in felony charges, up to four years in prison, and a $25,000 fine.
Currently, Meisinger’s Iowa licenses as an ARNP and RN remain active and in effect. A hearing on the Iowa Board of Nursing’s charges is scheduled for Jan. 16, 2026.

(Photo courtesy of the S.C. Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — An inmate who pleaded guilty to killing three and leaving messages written in blood chose to die by firing squad, according to a letter submitted to the state Supreme Court on Friday.
Stephen Bryant’s execution is scheduled to take place at 6 p.m. Nov. 14, marking the fifth to take place in the state this year. Bryant, 44, will be the third inmate put to death by firing squad since legislators added it as an option in 2021.

The other four inmates executed since the process resumed in September 2024 selected lethal injection. By law, inmates have until two weeks before their execution date to choose their method of execution. Anyone who doesn’t make a choice faces electrocution, which legislators made the default method in 2021, though no inmate has died by that method in the state since 2008.
Legislators made firing squad an option four years ago in an effort to restart executions after years of being unable to purchase the drugs used in lethal injections. A secrecy law passed in 2023 allowed prison officials to get the drugs later that year, making it an option once again.
Bryant’s execution would be the sixth in the country carried out by firing squad since the state Supreme Court resumed executions nationwide in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Before the two in South Carolina this year, the last firing squad execution took place in Utah in 2010.
Previous questions over methods
Attorneys for death row inmates have raised concerns about the legality of lethal injection and firing squad, though the state Supreme Court decided last year both were constitutional.
The most recent firing squad execution, carried out in April, faced scrutiny after inmate Mikal Mahdi’s attorneys claimed the bullets mostly missed his heart.
During a firing squad execution, three marksmen shoot live rounds at the inmate, who is strapped to a chair, through a hole in the wall 15 feet away, according to Department of Corrections protocols released during court proceedings.
An autopsy after Mahdi’s execution showed two bullet holes, instead of the three that appeared on the last inmate to die using that method, according to filings attorneys submitted to the state Supreme Court. Fragments of the bullets pierced Mahdi’s heart, but they did not strike it directly the way they did with the previous inmate, according to court filings.
Department of Corrections officials contend nothing went wrong. Two bullets struck Mahdi’s chest in the exact same spot, creating one entrance wound, spokeswoman Chrysti Shain has said. No bullet fragments were found in the room, she said.
Lethal injection has faced its own concerns. In court filings to the state Supreme Court and federal lawsuits, attorneys have repeatedly asked for more information about the drugs used to kill prisoners, which judges and the state’s highest court have said is unnecessary.
Death by lethal injection can be long and painful, as the inmate’s lungs fill up with fluid, attorneys have claimed in court filings, though experts for the state contend the drugs knock out inmates long before that occurs.
Bryant’s crimes and appeals
Bryant was sentenced to death for one of three Sumter County murders he committed 21 years ago. He never professed innocence. He pleaded guilty to all three killings.
His crime spree began on Oct. 5, 2004, when he broke into a house. Continued burglaries escalated three days later, when he shot Clinton Brown in the back while he was fishing in the Wateree River in Richland County. Brown survived.
Bryant picked up two of his victims, Cliff Gainey and Chris Burgess, in his truck before shooting them and leaving their bodies by the side of the road, according to court documents.
The killing of Willard Tietjen, however, was different.
Bryant broke into the 62-year-old’s home in Sumter County, where he shot Tietjen nine times before ransacking his house looking for items to steal. Bryant stayed at the house, smoking and using Tietjen’s computer and answering calls from his wife and daughter, telling them he had killed Tietjen, according to court filings.
Police found Tietjen’s body with cigarette burns on it, along with notes written on the walls, with some letters written in blood.
“Victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you can,” Bryant wrote, according to court documents.
Bryant also pleaded guilty to multiple other charges, including attacking a detention officer while in jail awaiting trial, according to court filings. He received two life sentences for the other two killings, along with a combined 100 years for his other crimes.
Bryant’s attorneys are asking the state’s highest court to reconsider his death sentence, claiming his mother’s drinking while she was pregnant with him, combined with childhood sexual abuse by multiple male relatives, caused Bryant to have mental defects that led to the slayings.
Other courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have declined to overturn his sentence for similar claims.
Until the court comes to a decision in that case, Bryant’s execution should be put on pause, his lawyers claimed in a filing asking for a stay.
The state’s response to those claims is due next week.
Intervention from a court or the governor is the only way Bryant, who has run out of normal appeals, can avoid the death chamber. Gov. Henry McMaster has not granted clemency since executions resumed.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-10-31 11:22:51.969101

Public data shows that Victory Field Operations has been paid throughout the cycle by the campaign of U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) for ballot access work. Additionally, Mission Michigan, the issues-based political action committee supporting James, has paid the firm for political strategy consulting. 
Victory Field Operations is a Republican petition signature collection firm founded by consultant Meghan Reckling, chief of staff for state Sen. Lana Theis (R-Brighton), and Jeff Wiggins, the current press secretary and senior advisor to Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt’s legislative office.

Nesbitt is also running for governor, raising questions of whether Wiggins was playing both sides of an intraparty horserace for the top seat in Michigan government.
Other Republicans seeking the GOP nomination include former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, pastor Ralph Rebandt and anti-property tax advocate Karla Wagner.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Mission Michigan was created in April to support James, and received a large $5 million contribution from Dan and Pamela DeVos, members of the prominent Republican DeVos family. The Detroit News’ editorial page editor, Kaitlyn Buss, wrote about the influx of cash from members of the DeVos family to Mission Michigan in May.
Michigan campaign finance reports show that the committee paid Victory Field Operations $40,000 for political strategy consulting, according to July and September filings.










It’s very unethical, and I would question his allegiance to either candidate.


– John Truscott, CEO of the Lansing-based bipartisan Truscott Rossman communications firm


The Michigan campaign finance reporting and disclosure interface has, by all accounts, struggled over the past year to accurately report filings due to an overhaul of the system, which has caused some backlash from the oversight arm of the state House of Representatives. Several instances have arisen where filings needed to be amended due to issues with the system.
Mission Michigan’s treasurer did not respond to two phone calls and messages requesting confirmation that it paid Victory Field Operations for strategy consulting.

James is viewed as a leading candidate for the office of governor on the Republican side, a campaign being waged against the better wishes of President Donald Trump and the leaders of the GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Wiggins’ firm was founded in the wake of the 2022 petition signature scandal that sank the gubernatorial campaigns of several Republicans, preventing James Craig, Michael Brown, Donna Brandenburg, Perry Johnson and Michael Markey from ever reaching the ballot that year.
Massive signature fraud scandal upends Michigan GOP gubernatorial race

Victory Field Operations aims to cut out the third-party signature collection vendors, the type of which caused the 2022 debacle, and to ensure that quality Republican candidates can make it on the ballot. The outfit also prides itself on its in-house work ethic.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Wiggins was asked if there had been a firewall built around his work with Victory and its work for James’ campaign given that his legislative staff position serves in an advisory role to Nesbitt.
“We ensure that all of our clients are comfortable with who they work with at our company,” Wiggins said. “And there are point people who work with specific clients, and so we do everything to make sure that our clients are comfortable with who their point person is at our company. If the candidates are comfortable, it’s whatever our clients are comfortable with.”
When asked more pointedly if he was the point person for James’ campaign with Victory Field Operations, Wiggins said he was not willing or able to discuss the inner workings of the company.
Asked if Nesbitt knew about the work he was doing on the side for James, or if he raised any concerns about him working for the campaign, Wiggins again said that he was not able to discuss client communications.

Two Lansing and Michigan political insiders who spoke with the Advance said the situation was a clear conflict of interest, even if it wasn’t illegal in terms of Michigan election law.
“It’s very unethical, and I would question his allegiance to either candidate,” said John Truscott, CEO of the Lansing-based bipartisan Truscott Rossman communications firm and an expert in public relations. “You can’t get paid a government salary working for one candidate, and get a campaign salary while being paid by another one. I don’t know anybody who thinks that would be OK.”
Truscott went on to say that the situation and others like it was “a symptom of the lack of ethics that seems to be creeping into every corner around Lansing these days.”
“I really thought that, looking at things like the prosecution of [former House Speaker] Rick Johnson and the prosecution of [former House Speaker] Lee Chatfield … would get people to tighten up and look at their conduct more carefully,” Truscott said. “But it appears things are getting even more loose, and that’s really unfortunate. It’s what drives the public to not have any faith in their elected leadership. If I were Aric Nesbitt or John James, I would fire him immediately.”
Jeff Timmer, formerly the executive director of the Michigan Republican Party, and now a principal of the political strategy firm Two Rivers Public Affairs, as well as a senior advisor to the Lincoln Project, said that it was certainly unethical, but the more interesting aspect, in his view, was that it was all happening out in the open.
“This is all transparently disclosed, so it’s not like you can be sneaking around behind your boss’s back,” Timmer said.
He also employed a sports analogy to describe the situation, noting that James hiring Nesbitt’s legislative senior advisor, and that Nesbitt would allow Wiggins to be hired by James, is akin to a coordinator for one football team building a game plan during the week and then showing up on the sideline of another team on game day.
Asked if that analogy still held water even though Wiggins wasn’t working on Nesbitt’s campaign, Timmer said he believed that it did.
“You don’t work both sides of the fight,” Timmer said.
In response, Wiggins said he considers Victory Field Operations as a vendor for ballot access, nothing more. Riffing off Timmer’s football analogy, Wiggins said the work, in his view, was more akin to making the pads and helmets for high-impact players.
“We make sure that the people that are trying to play the game are doing so as safely as possible,” he said.

The East Coast Migrant Head Start Project, aimed at providing early education for the children of migrant farmworkers, is set to temporarily lay off 258 employees across 12 North Carolina counties and suspend operations at nine child care centers in the state on Nov. 1, according to a filing with the NC Department of Commerce.
The Salisbury-Rowan Community Action Agency is also stopping all services at the end of October, including its Head Start programs as well as workforce development offerings. According to the program’s website, that will leave 408 children without care.
Head Start offers free, federally funded child care for children up to 5 years old with the aim of preparing them for school and helping them develop social skills, providing care to around 750,000 infants, toddlers, and children across the U.S.
Federal funding for Head Start programs is disbursed annually to local nonprofits at the start of each month. An estimated 140 nationwide were due to receive their year’s funding in October or November. Those programs provide child care to about 65,000 students across the country.
Gov. Josh Stein, joined by Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt and State Superintendent Mo Green, wrote in an April letter to Congress that the Head Start program adds $290 million to North Carolina’s economy, creating thousands of  jobs.
Roughly 19,500 North Carolina children depend on Head Start for their early education and care, according to the governor’s office. Rural counties could be the hardest hit by the freeze, as many depend on Head Start funding for more than 20% of their child care slots.
Some nonprofits dependent on Head Start funds are already reeling from the loss of other federal dollars.
Earlier this month, Gaston Community Action, which operates Head Start programs in Gaston and Lincoln counties, furloughed employees who were funded by the Community Services Block Grant, as that program is also on hold. The organization wrote in a Facebook post that its Head Start programs remain unaffected for now.
The Wayne Action Group for Economic Solvency, which provides Head Start care for 812 children across five North Carolina counties, has also halted services funded by the Community Services Block Grant, and wrote in an update on Facebook that its Head Start offerings may be impacted starting Nov. 14.
“Research consistently shows that children who attend Head Start are more likely to graduate high school and enroll in and complete college and are less likely to be arrested, enter foster care, or experience poor health outcomes,” Stein wrote in the April letter. “Without Head Start, our most vulnerable children will suffer — with likely ripple effects on our education, child welfare, health, and criminal justice systems.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1367212888-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 11:22:51.969101

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is ordering the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services to give $7 million to regional food banks and up to $18 million in emergency relief benefits to more than 63,000 low-income Ohioans. 
DeWine’s executive order requires ODJFS to allocate $7 million to regional food banks using Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds. The order also requires ODJFS to double the monthly benefit for the state’s 63,000 Ohio Works First recipients — which include more than 57,000 children. 
Ohio Works First provides assistance to low-income families with children — at or below 50% of the federal poverty level — using TANF funds.

Ohio Works First recipients will receive their usual monthly benefits on Saturday and will receive an additional weekly benefit equaling a quarter of their typical monthly allotment.  
“While we will always do everything we can to support Ohioans who need it most, this is not a viable, long-term solution,” DeWine said in a statement. “SNAP is a federal program that is specifically federally funded.”
About 1.4 million Ohioans receive SNAP benefits and the U.S. Department of Agriculture said federal food aid would not be issued Nov. 1 because of the government shutdown, which started on Oct. 1. 
Ohio’s average SNAP benefits are $190 a month, ODJFS Spokesperson Tom Betti said. Ohioans must have a net income at or below federal poverty guidelines —  $32,150 a year for a family of four — to qualify for SNAP. 
“Not every family is going to get additional funds, but we want to target specifically those families where we thought that they really desperately would need the money and would need the help,” DeWine said to reporters. 
Food banks across Ohio have said the need will be beyond what they can bear with SNAP benefits not being distributed. 
“Governor DeWine’s approach allows us to allocate funds using ordinary distribution channels – providing targeted support to families in greatest need, while also assisting food banks, which can reach people quickly and directly,” ODJFS Director Matt Damschroder said in a statement.
Ohio’s minority leaders in the House and the Senate expressed gratitude while also asking DeWine to do more.
“I am grateful that there will be some relief for those in need, but this executive order does not go nearly far enough to help,” said Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati. “We are on the tipping edge of a crisis and the governor needs to do more.”
“While we’re glad the governor has taken steps to protect Ohio families that are caught in the middle of political debates taking place in Washington, this is not nearly enough to make up for the potential gap in funding,” said Senate Democratic Leader Nickie J. Antonio, D-Lakewood.
Ohio Democratic lawmakers have been calling on DeWine to authorize funds during a lapse in federal food assistance. DeWine’s spokesperson Dan Tierney, however, says there is no mechanism for the state to directly fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments, “regardless of funding source.” 
“Ohio does not run the SNAP payment system,” Tierney said in an email. “We do not have access to that system to fund SNAP. Ohio’s role is to verify if beneficiaries are eligible for SNAP and to transmit that to the federal government.” 
Ohio Republican lawmakers are blaming U.S. Senate Democrats. Congressional Democrats have refused to sign on to a funding bill if Republicans don’t agree to extend subsidies to buy health insurance on marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.
“The easiest and best way to help Ohioans in need of food assistance is for U.S. Senate Democrats to end its filibuster of SNAP benefits and other important federal programs and approve the clean continuing resolution passed by the U.S. House,” DeWine said in a statement.
Ohio Republican lawmakers also argue this needs to be solved at the federal level, not the state level. 
“Everyone’s heart is in the right place on this,” state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, said during the most recent Senate Session. “If you want a solution to this, it’s at the federal level. It’s not at the state level.” 
State Rep. Latyna Humphrey, D-Columbus, introduced Ohio House Bill 502 which would make an appropriation through the Budget Stabilization Fund (also known as the “Rainy Day Fund”) to continue to fund SNAP and some other federal programs if there were to be a lapse in federal funding, but the bill has had no hearings.  
“Ohio families are truly going to be in crisis,” she said during a recent press conference. “We can’t stand by while families wonder how they’ll put food on the table.”
The Ohio Senate Democratic Caucus sent a letter to DeWine asking him to use the state’s $3.9 billion “Rainy Day Fund” as a way to continue funding SNAP benefits to Ohioans, saying funding SNAP benefits for one month would cost $263 million.
“The sole purpose of the Budget Stabilization Fund is to support a previously enacted budget if state revenue decreases in an economic downturn,” Tierney said in an email. “The fund may be accessed only if the Ohio General Assembly enacts legislation to do so.”
Several other states — including Republican-led Iowa, Louisiana, Nevada, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia — have also announced plans to help those who are losing SNAP benefits, according to NBC News. 
The Ohio House Democratic Caucus also sent a letter to DeWine asking him to declare a state of emergency and to work with lawmakers to make sure food banks have enough resources to feed people. 
Ohio Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, offered up an amendment during the most recent Ohio Senate Session that would have allowed the use of the Ohio Budget Stabilization Fund to fully fund the SNAP program during a lapse in federal funding and allowed the state to ask for reimbursement from the federal government for those funds. 
“These (SNAP) funds are vital drivers for our local economy, generating commerce at our grocery stores and neighborhood markets,” Smith said. “Losing this spending power would inflict substantial harm, not only on families, but on small businesses and employees.” 
The amendment was voted down in a party-line vote. 
“I’m very sympathetic to the idea in this amendment that we do need to restore SNAP funding, but unfortunately, this is a very expensive endeavor,” said Ohio Sen. Bill Blessing, R-Colerain Twp.
Ohio Senate Republicans argued there’s no guarantee the state would get reimbursed from the federal government. 
“The potential damage to our budget as a result of this could be devastating,” said Ohio Sen. George Lang, R-West Chester.
Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, called the SNAP amendment “appalling.” 
“If Ohio and other states might follow in our footsteps of backfilling the federal government, all that does is encourage them to remain closed because we will backstop them whether or not we get reimbursed at some point,” he said. “… Do we want to encourage that human behavior?”
The longest government shutdown took place during Trump’s first term as president in 2019 and lasted 35 days.

And which state has a fancy for Almond Joy? And where's all the chocolate?,"Tonight, thousands of young ghouls and ghosts will hit the streets in search of the best sweets in their neighborhoods — but what candy do Connecticut kids (and their parents) enjoy most from these yearly hauls?
Starburst is the most popular candy in Connecticut and in the nation, topping the charts in a total of 13 states, according to a year-long study done by InnerBody analyzing Google Trends search data over the past year. Sour Patch Kids came in second place, taking the top spot in eight states.
Chocolate candy was much less popular across the nation, according to the study. Reese’s took the slot for top chocolate candy in the U.S.
Connecticut’s neighbor, Rhode Island, was the only state where Almond Joy came in first place.
Nationwide, spending on candy is expected to reach $3.9 billion this year, and Halloween costs are predicted to reach a record $13.1 billion, according to the National Retail Federation’s annual consumer survey. Candy and chewing gum prices have risen 9.8% from September 2024 to September 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
This comes out to around $114 on overall Halloween spending per person, another spending record for the holiday, according to the survey.
As for costume attire, spending is also high, but the NRF survey found that 51% of consumers plan to dress in costume. The most popular kid costume is Spiderman, and the most popular adult costume is a witch.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bMhGz-what-s-the-most-popular-halloween-candy-in-each-state--1024x844.png,,,2025-10-31 11:22:51.969101

(Amodei photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images; Trump and Lombardo photos by Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)One of the most surprising revelations of the SNAP saga is how powerless Republican leaders are. 
At least according to them.
When it was suggested last week that the state of Nevada should step in to deliver SNAP benefits if the federal government wasn’t going to, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo said it couldn’t be done because the Trump administration said so.
Lombardo was at least partly right. The Trump administration’s Department of Agriculture has declared states can’t pay Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Benefits.
Citing selected passages from federal legislation and regulations, the USDA had crafted a rationale not only for not paying SNAP benefits during a shutdown, which is unprecedented. Drawing on a precious reading of dainty rules, the USDA has also decreed that states can’t pay SNAP benefits in the federal government’s stead, or if states do, they won’t be compensated later.
As of Friday morning, USDA websites were continuing to post a blatantly political attack on Senate Democrats while invoking MAGA red meat tropes like “illegal aliens” and “gender mutilation procedures.” So a reasonable person might be excused for suspecting the agency’s order telling states they couldn’t pay for SNAP benefits is not a result of earnest and honest interpretation of the law, but of cherry-picking and misinterpreting it to play MAGA shutdown politics, the well-being of households be damned.
The USDA’s arguments flummoxed a federal judge Thursday, who struggled to get Trump administration lawyers to explain a coherent legal, regulatory, or budgetary justification for failing to put money on households’ SNAP EBT cards during the shutdown. (As this is written the judge has yet to rule on the request from 22 state attorneys general, including Nevada’s, to keep SNAP benefits coming.)
In declaring that he is powerless in the face of a memo from a federal agency, Lombardo is not alone. Governors in other states, heeding the Trump administration’s directives, have also determined they can’t fill the void and pay SNAP payments.
Some states, however, are preparing to deliver SNAP benefits directly to their residents’ EBT cards. Why Virginia’s Republican governor can create a program to do that but Nevada’s can’t is a question Lombardo hasn’t answered.
There may be perfectly good reasons; Virginia’s state government infrastructure is larger and more robust than Nevada’s, and Nevada may simply lack the administrative wherewithal to establish an EBT distribution system on the fly.
But whatever the scope of technical or administrative challenges beyond Lombardo’s control, there’s another fact that can’t be ignored: Republicans love to whine about “federal overreach” and “unelected bureaucrats in Washington.”
Lombardo’s no exception. He sends strident letters to the president complaining about all the red tape and regulations that are hindering federal land sales or hurting the economy. 
Or at least Lombardo sent strident letters when the president was Biden.
When the heavy hand of the federal government dictates policy to states, Republican governors don’t take it lying down. They challenge the offending policies, even in court. 
But Lombardo left that to Nevada’s attorney general, Democrat Aaron Ford.
Instead of blasting federal overreach from unelected Washington bureaucrats, Lombardo responded to the USDA’s memo meekly, saying “even if I called a special convening of the Legislature and the Legislature opted to appropriate temporary SNAP funding, the State would not be able to directly fund the program.” Because the Trump administration said so.
Rep. Mark Amodei, the only Nevada Republican in Congress, has similarly exhibited powerlessness in a crisis. Even though his party controls the White House, both houses of Congress, and the United States Supreme Court, there is simply nothing Republicans can do to prevent the end of SNAP benefits, according to Amodei.
“There is no mystery that, despite some commendable efforts from private individuals and the administration to delay the realities of government shutdowns, everyone knows when SNAP benefits run dry and programs start shutting down,” Amodei said in a (syntactically compromised) press release this week.
“Everyone knows,” congressman? 
SNAP benefits have not “run dry.” The reserve fund has $6 billion. And to reiterate, ending SNAP benefits is unprecedented during a government shutdown.
But Amodei’s right when he says “there is no mystery” about why SNAP benefits are scheduled to end Nov. 1.
 It’s the result of a choice made by the Trump administration.
Trump has spent the last nine months aggressively flaunting laws enacted by Congress, and gloating about it. He’s reduced Amodei and the Republicans who hold majorities in both houses of Congress to irrelevance, mere nodding bobblehead dolls.
But now Trump and his White House are claiming they are powerless to continue paying SNAP benefits during the shutdown. A man who is eager to defy and willing to shred the U.S. Constitution now asks everyone to believe he is constrained by some regulatory fine print — fine print that the administration itself fished out to willfully misinterpret.
“Republicans and Democrats have to work together” is a mantra being chanted from coast to coast, often accompanied by assigning blame to both sides.
But when it comes to the argument over providing food assistance to needy households, there’s a big difference between Democrats and Republicans.
Democrats have argued the USDA’s decision is wrong, and sued over it. They’ve pleaded with the Trump administration and the courts in an effort to see that SNAP benefits are not interrupted.
But the only thing Democrats have the power to do is unconditionally surrender to Republicans in the shutdown fight, and then hope that Trump and Republicans will graciously agree to negotiate with Democrats to shore up a health insurance program Republicans have spent the last 15 years vowing to repeal.
On the specific issue of continuing SNAP funding, Democrats are powerless.
Trump isn’t. He could assure benefits will continue to be distributed to EBT cards in Nevada and the nation with a single post on social media ordering USDA to make it so.
Democrats don’t have any power. Trump does. But instead of using it to help people, Trump’s wielding his power to deprive families of food, because he thinks hurting them will hurt Democrats. Republican officials in Nevada are going along with the fiction that the SNAP crisis is the result of Democratic defiance, while ignoring the fact that it is a deliberate choice sanctioned by their dear Republican leader.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image-10-31-25-at-7.24 AM-1024x555.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 10:57:30.580980

Barring a deal in Congress that would end the federal government shutdown, SNAP, which helps roughly one in eight Americans buy groceries, will lose funding this Saturday, November 1.
In Connecticut, more than 10% of the state’s population rely on SNAP benefits to feed themselves, their families and their children.  Across our state, 58,000 families are expected to lose at least $25 per month in SNAP benefits, with these families experiencing an average monthly benefit loss of $194. These cuts will have immediate and devastating consequences for thousands of families who are already struggling to put food on the table. Waterbury is projected to see over 4,600 families losing monthly benefits. Yet, impacts will reach beyond urban areas. In Connecticut, families receiving SNAP assistance span every corner of our state, and every one of our 169 towns have families and our neighbors receiving food assistance. 
The Challenge Before Us
While we are grateful that Connecticut is stepping forward with $3 millionin emergency funding to CT Foodshare, we must be clear-eyed about the scope of this crisis. This emergency allocation represents just a fraction of the $72 million in monthly costs required to fully fund SNAP benefits in Connecticut. The math is sobering, and the gap between need and resources is staggering.
The People Impacted
These are not just statistics. Behind every SNAP benefit cut is a parent deciding whether to skip meals so their children can eat, a senior citizen stretching their medication budget to afford groceries, a working family forced to choose between paying rent and buying food, and a child going to school hungry – unable to focus on learning because they don’t know when their next meal will come.
Our food banks and emergency food providers are already operating at capacity. They cannot absorb this level of increased demand without significant community support.
A Call to Action
This is a moment that demands action from all of us. Here’s how you can help:
Donate to Your Local Food Bank – Financial contributions allow food banks to purchase nutritious food in bulk and respond quickly. Every dollar makes a difference, and every donation, whether $10, $100 or $10,000, helps feed a neighbor in need.
Organize a Food Drive – Rally your workplace, school, faith community, or neighborhood to collect non-perishable food items. Focus on nutritious, high-protein options like peanut butter, canned proteins, whole grain cereals, and canned vegetables and fruits.
Volunteer Your Time – Food banks need volunteers to sort donations, pack food boxes, and distribute meals. A few hours of your time can help feed dozens of families.
Advocate – Contact your elected representatives at the state and federal level. Let them know that food security is a priority for you and that all Connecticut families deserve to eat. Share your concerns on social media and in conversations with neighbors. Collective voices create change, and our elected officials need to hear that this issue matters to all of us.
Moving Forward Together
Food insecurity is not just a hunger issue – it’s a health issue, an education issue, an economic issue, and a moral issue. Our neighbors, our seniors, our veterans, our children – no one should go hungry in our state.  No one in Connecticut should have to choose between feeding their family, keeping a roof over their heads, or putting gas in the car to get to work.
The wise Ashleigh Brilliant, author and cartoonist, brilliantly reminded us that “Not being able to do everything is no excuse for not doing everything you can.” And while we work toward systemic solutions, there are things – big and small – that each of us can do to help our neighbor have a meal.
The need is immediate. The stakes are high. The time to act is now.
We urge every person, every business, and every organization in Connecticut to join us in this critical effort.

Some residents will be casting ballots that may have an impact on everything from the direction their communities take to who represents them. They will also weigh in on specific questions surrounding civil service reform and whether they should bother issuing public notices to local newspapers.
These are some of the questions up for a vote on ballots.
Bethel
Bethel, a town of slightly over 20,000, has the most revisions up for a vote in Fairfield County. Eight proposals will be voted on in Bethel this election season. Some of them include raising the threshold for referendums on capital expenditure and infrastructure projects which are not funded through user fees, grants, or loans, from at least $1 million and up, according to Republican Bethel First Selectman Dan Carter. Other changes include lengthening the board of selectmen’s terms from two to four years and including more inclusive gender pronouns when referring to people in the town charter.
Bridgeport
Voters in Connecticut’s largest city can now vote on reforming the city charter. Key proposals include ending the practice of electing city and town clerks. Instead, those roles would be switched to civil service positions, starting in 2031. The Bridgeport’s Sheriff’s Office would be eliminated, partly because according to the charter revision proposal, state marshals are able to perform the same roles and protect the city from potential lawsuits.
[Who’s on the ballot in Bridgeport? A 2025 election voters’ guide]
Other proposals include strengthening the Ethics Commission to include a municipal ethics office and adopt a code of ethics. Many Bridgeport officials have been accused of various legal and ethical transgressions over the years, including the 2023 mayoral Democratic primary, tainted by allegations of ballot fraud.
Fairfield
Fairfield residents are heading to the ballot box, and can vote on seven proposals. Voters will be asked to answer a question on the ballot that would revise the town charter by mandating any selectman filling a vacancy during the first 18 months of their term to stand for election to serve the remaining two years.
That change could impact future first selectmen finding themselves in a similar position to current First Selectman, Christine Vitale. Former Democratic First Selectman Bill Gerber, elected in 2023, died in office earlier this year, succeeded by Vitale, his running mate in a process many town Republicans claimed was not transparent. Vitale denied those claims, saying she followed the town charter. Vitale is expecting to face off against Republican State Sen. Tony Hwang in a future special election. They are not on the ballot this November.
Other changes include ceasing publishing notices in local newspapers unless required by state law, instead publishing them on the town’s site and allowing the town’s legislative body, the Representative Town Meeting, to vote on whether to retain lawyers.
Norwalk
Voters in Norwalk may end up revising their town charter for the first time in over a century. The city’s charter revision commission said the charter needed to be changed to reflect the rapid changes the city experienced over the last decades.
Some of those changes include renaming Norwalk’s legislative body from the Common Council to the City Council, tying councilmember compensation to a percentage of the mayor’s annual salary, and lengthening the mayor and city clerk’s terms from two to four years starting in 2029. City council positions would also be extended beginning in 2030.
The language of the charter could also be revised to make it more comprehensible for city residents.
Other key changes also include making it easier to introduce petitions and using a public applicant pool to fill city board and commission vacancies.
Trumbull
Trumbull residents have just one question up for a vote this year, but it’s a question that has inflamed local opinion and that’s whether or not Trumbull should fork over $27 million to build a new senior/community center that has been in the planning stages for years.
Supporters of a new center include the local Democratic Party including First Selectman Vicki Tesoro, who stated the benefits of a new structure and the value it would bring over time, noting the alternative, renovating the existing center, isn’t feasible due to its age.
Town Republicans who regained control of the town council two years ago said the original plan was too costly. They responded by proposing cost saving measures which resulted in a smaller design, although that process was also met with controversy.

In addition to the payout to 34-year-old Ramsey Kettle, the settlement calls for several policy changes in jail operations, including a new requirement that all correctional officers, regardless of rank, report any instance in which food or water is withheld as a disciplinary measure.
“While the court’s decision and this settlement cannot undo the unlawful torture Mr. Kettle endured, they have shone a light on Otter Tail County’s failure to respect the human rights of those in their custody,” Catherine Ahlin-Halverson, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, said in statement announcing the settlement.
The ACLU partnered with a pro bono lawyer from the firm Norton Rose Fulbright in bringing the suit.
Ahlin-Halverson said the settlement ensures that “the withholding of food and water as punishment ends here.”
Kettle’s ordeal began on February 9, 2024, just as he finished serving a 30-month sentence at the state prison in Rush City on a felony conviction for terroristic threats. Instead of being released, Kettle was arrested on new charges of aggravated witness tampering.
Several months later, those charges would be dismissed. Before that happened, Kettle was transferred for pre-trial detention to the Otter Tail County Jail, where he was immediately placed in “disciplinary segregation.”  
The rationale: Kettle had committed infractions during a prior stint in the jail, and so he would have to serve out the remainder of his sanction – a practice referred to as “rollover discipline.”
The following morning, Kettle asked officers to retrieve some personal paperwork. When he was provided with documents belonging to another inmate, he became agitated and smeared feces on the window of his cell door.
According to the lawsuit, as well as a separate investigation by the Minnesota Department of Corrections, Kettle was subsequently told by his jailers that he would not be given food or water until he cleaned the cell.
Over the following days, Kettle languished in squalor.
At one point, according to the lawsuit, Kettle was observed “licking the feces off the cell window” and told officers he was “hungry so I’m eating my own sh*t.”  The stench was bad enough that inmates were removed from adjacent cells, while the guards used vapor rub as a masking agent.
During the 52 hours that Kettle went without food or water, officers recorded more than 100 welfare checks, all of which reported him as “ok.”
A whistleblower at the jail eventually reported the episode, which triggered an investigation by the DOC. In the end, the agency temporarily stripped the jail of its certification to hold detainees for more than 72 hours; employees underwent additional training; and Sheriff Barry Fitzgibbons issued a public apology.
The lawsuit against Otter Tail County included claims for civil rights violations, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In August, U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Menendez rejected the county’s motion to dismiss, paving the way for the settlement.
In addition to the cash payout, according to the ACLU, the county agreed to end its practice of rolling over disciplinary sanctions. 
It will also now require that correctional officers conduct “meaningful” welfare checks on detainees to look for signs of mental distress, ensure the person’s safety is not compromised by “biohazard material” and confirm they have access to water.
Kettle was released from the Otter Tail County Jail in April 2024 when the witness tampering charge was dismissed.
He is now incarcerated in the neighboring Becker County Jail on charges of felony assault and arson.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-31 14:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,New Trump admin. rule bars loan relief for public service workers tied to ‘illegal’ activity,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/31/trump-education-department-public-service-loan-forgiveness/,New rules give the US Education Department expanded power to ban organizations from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is forging ahead with plans to eject some nonprofits from a popular student loan forgiveness program if their work is deemed to have a “substantial illegal purpose” — a move that could cut off some teachers, doctors and other public workers from federal loan cancellation.
New rules finalized Thursday give the Education Department expanded power to ban organizations from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Trump administration said it’s necessary to block taxpayer money from lawbreakers. Critics say it turns the program into a tool of political retribution.
Set to take effect in July, the policy is aimed primarily at organizations that work with immigrants and transgender youth.
It grants the education secretary power to exclude groups from the program if they engage in activities including the trafficking or “chemical castration” of children, illegal immigration and supporting terrorist organizations. “Chemical castration” is defined as using hormone therapy or drugs that delay puberty — gender-affirming care common for transgender children or teens.
It amounts to a major reworking of a program that has canceled loans for more than 1 million Americans and was created by Congress in 2007 to steer more college graduates into lower-paying public sector jobs. The Trump administration has yet to identify specific groups it intends to target, but it estimates fewer than 10 would be barred per year.
The program “was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service – not to subsidize organizations that violate the law, whether by harboring illegal immigrants or performing prohibited medical procedures that attempt to transition children away from their biological sex,” Education Undersecretary Nicholas Kent said in a statement.
The new rules are weaponizing loan forgiveness to make it harder for groups that work on issues like refugee and transgender rights, said Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights.
Lukens said many of the attorneys, social workers and paralegals who work at his organization on deportation defense and other immigration litigation count on public service loan forgiveness to take jobs that pay significantly less than the private sector.
“All of a sudden, that’s going away,” Lukens said. “The younger generation, I hope, will be able to wait this out for the next couple of years to see if it gets better, but if it doesn’t, we’re going to see a lot of people leave the field to go and work in a for-profit space.”
The program has rewarded a wide range of public service careers
The program promises to cancel federal student loans for government employees and many nonprofit workers after they have made 10 years of payments. It has long been open to government workers, teachers, firefighters and employees of public hospitals. Eligibility rules laid out by Congress focus mostly on nonprofits’ tax status and their field of work.
The benefit has gone to workers at organizations across the political spectrum. Yet in a March action demanding new limits, President Donald Trump said it has “misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.”
A central concern of critics is the wide latitude the department is giving itself to determine if an organization’s work should be considered to have a “substantial illegal purpose.”
Employers across state and local government as well as nonprofits can be expelled from the program if a state or federal court rules against them, or if they agree to a legal settlement that includes admission of guilt. Performing gender-affirming care in the 27 states that outlaw it, for example, appears to be grounds for expulsion.
Even without a legal finding, the education secretary will be able to independently determine that an organization should be barred. The secretary would weigh whether the “preponderance of the evidence” leans against the employer.
The department dismissed concerns from many who said that bar is too low.
“It ensures decisions are grounded in fact, not speculation, and allows the Department to act promptly to protect both borrowers and taxpayers,” federal officials wrote.
Critics see an opening for decisions based on ideology
Among those opposing the proposal were prominent associations in higher education, health care and legal professions. In public comments submitted to the department, many called it an illegal overstep and said it would undermine an incentive that has helped address work shortages in high-demand fields.
The American Bar Association said it could decrease the ranks of public defenders and those in public interest law. Thousands of people will lose access to representation, the association said, “simply because those attorneys’ jobs were deemed politically unfavorable by the Secretary.”
The National Council of Nonprofits said the policy would allow future administrations from any political party to change eligibility rules “based on their own priorities or ideology.”
Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the overhaul will prevent taxpayers from covering loan relief for employees at “radical organizations that violate state and federal laws.”
Under the new rules, employers can only be sanctioned for activities that take place on or after July 1, 2026. Those barred from the program can reapply for eligibility after 10 years or rejoin sooner if they follow a “corrective action plan” approved by the secretary.
Documents from the department indicate that a single violation of the law may or may not be enough to get an employer barred, depending on the circumstances. Not all organizations that break the law have a “substantial illegal purpose,” the agency said, and it ultimately comes down to the secretary’s analysis of the evidence.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lyndon-Baines-Johnson-Building.jpg,,,2025-10-31 14:02:34.575980

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The U.S. Department of Energy of Wednesday closed on a nearly $1.6 billion loan to Indiana’s Wabash Valley Resources for a “clean” fertilizer facility in West Terre Haute — and the project’s carbon dioxide capture and storage system.
“For too long, America has been dependent on foreign sources of fertilizer,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a news release. “Under President (Donald) Trump’s leadership, we are changing that by putting America first, relying on American coal, American workers, and American innovation to power our farms and feed our families.”
Wabash Valley Resources intends to pipe and inject 1.67 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface as part of its plan to produce “low-carbon-intensity” anhydrous ammonia fertilizer at a former coal gasification plant.
‘Too many unknowns’: As company forges on with carbon sequestration project, residents mobilize

The gasifier will use coal and petroleum coke — an oil refining byproduct — as feedstock, according to a project summary.
The DOE’s loan was for $1.559 billion.
A panoply of political and business leaders celebrated the announcement, including Indiana Gov. Mike Braun.
“Wabash Valley Resources is putting America first — transforming an idle fossil energy plant into a fertilizer engine that strengthens our farmers, bolsters energy independence, and revitalizes coal country,” he said. “This is the kind of vision and leadership we need to compete globally.”
The company’s CEO, Dan Williams, called the project “more than an investment.”
“It’s a new chapter for a world-class facility and the community that built it,” he said. The project is “restoring good-paying jobs and proving that rural Indiana can help lead America’s clean energy future.”
Williams also praised organized labor, “whose skill and professionalism will bring this vision to life.”
But groups of Hoosier landowners and other opponents denounced the project as a “scam.”
“It is shameful that this administration would hand out $1.5 billion to a privately owned, Korean-backed corporation during a shutdown when everyday people can’t receive basic government services and government employees go unpaid. That is not the American way,” Janet Cianteo, a member of the Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources and Indiana Action Team.
Korean firms Hanwha Asset Management and Korea Investment Real Asset Management have invested in Wabash Valley Resources, and the Korean government has also been involved, according to the company’s news release.
“This company and its foreign partners will be hard pressed to ever have majority support in our community,” Cianteo said. “We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting Hoosier land and lives from this dangerous scheme.”

The Indiana Action Team is part of the Nebraska-based Bold Alliance, best known for its opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline extension.
“It is disgraceful that this project is being foisted on Hoosiers with the backing of our government and our public money,” said Emma Schmit, the Bold Alliance’s pipeline fighters director. “Enough is enough. We should not have to sacrifice our property rights or take on the risks of a proven-to-fail technology so Wabash Valley Resources’ investors can afford another private island.”
The groups observed the loan was initiated under former President Joe Biden’s administration but frozen under Trump’s, and the project description no longer boasts of the undertaking’s carbon dioxide sequestration components.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued permits early last year allowing Wabash Valley Resources to construct wells. The EPA in August found the injection and monitoring wells would have “no significant impact” on the environment.

As the then-new CEO of the Full Employment Council of Kansas City, he needed to get a handle on the technology on his desk.
“I had to learn how to do this stuff — work the computer,” McQueen told The Beacon via Zoom. “I had to go back to training, as a CEO, at a community college on my own. … Now I can do it.”
McQueen said he had to continually learn new technology just to stay up to date with the ever-evolving workforce. Today’s workers, he said, also need constant learning and skill refinement as they see the disruptive rise in generative artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT.
“You’ve gotta keep your skills up to compete in the market,” McQueen said. “You can’t use the same oil in your car for a year — you’ve got to change the oil to not wear your pistons out. We’ve all got to update and change.”
In Kansas City and beyond, AI is transforming work with a combination of automation and augmentation. Automation is when an AI can fully complete a task, and AI augmentation is when a human and AI work in tandem.
Jobs have started disappearing in information services, professional and business services, and office and administrative support sectors as automation and AI-assisted work have increased productivity, reducing the need for workers. Meanwhile new, but so far fewer, positions emerge in AI development and data center construction and maintenance.
“This is not a maybe, sometime, Star Trek prediction,” Miles Bassett, founder of Prairie Code AI, told the 2025 Kansas Economic Outlook Conference recently. “The AI revolution is happening right now.”
AI represents an exponential change to the workforce beyond jobs lost to automation or increases in productivity. The very nature of work — the tasks that fill our days — is being rewritten in real time, and workers will need to adapt.
“If we fumble this (AI implementation) and AI doesn’t take your job directly, someone using AI will,” Bassett said.
 AI disruption has started

More than 40,000 workers in Kansas City work in the 10 largest occupations most susceptible to AI automation, according to a recent analysis from Jasmine Escalera at MyPerfectResume. The career expert used data from Microsoft’s Working with AI study and cross-referenced it with occupational and employment wage statistics in the Kansas City area to reach that conclusion.
The analysis found customer service representatives to be the most vulnerable to AI in Kansas City. There are 23,750 customer service workers in the area, and 44% of their daily tasks could potentially be automated.
Escalera told The Beacon that doesn’t necessarily mean that 44% of customer service workers will lose their jobs. People will still be needed for escalated customer service issues. But she wasn’t surprised to see customer service representatives as the most vulnerable vocation since automated systems have been used by many companies for years now.
“One of my biggest irritations in life is trying to get to a customer service rep and never speaking to an actual human,” Escalera said. “We’ve been seeing the slow evolution and change of the customer service space, and we will be seeing continued impact there.”
Escalera’s analysis also found that white-collar service jobs are vulnerable to AI. Roughly 17,000 Kansas City workers like financial advisers, management analysts, public relations specialists and web developers all have at least 35% of their tasks that are potentially automatable.
The University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School found that nationwide 42% of current jobs are potentially exposed to AI and that based on real-world generative AI applications, companies could expect a labor cost savings of roughly 25% from gains in efficiency.

That means that as companies see productivity increase as AI is implemented, they will require fewer workers to achieve the same results. Employers will then decide to cut employees or change their current employees’ job duties.
“There cannot be a customer service worker that comes in and all you do is answer the phone,” McQueen said. “That’s done.”
Bekah Selby-Leach, director of the Center for Economic Development and Business Research at Wichita State University, told the Kansas economic conference that the uncertainty surrounding AI — paired with inflation, tariffs and other concerns —  has many businesses in “wait and see” mode over hiring for the next year.
“We’re in a period of high uncertainty,” Selby-Leach said. “Change is happening, whether we want it to or not.”
Selby-Leach noted that statewide, Kansas is expected to see employment decline for financial service workers, information service workers and business and professional services workers in the next few years due to automation and AI. Those sectors of white-collar service workers have already seen thousands of jobs lost in the Kansas City area in the last year, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Early indications are that young people trying to start their careers are bearing the burden of the initial wave of AI’s workforce transformation.
An August report from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab showed that since widespread adoption of generative AI in 2022 there has been a drop in entry-level white-collar service jobs. Those aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed occupations saw a 13% decline in employment. This was while the report found that jobs numbers overall have grown during the same time period.
The study also found that employment remained steady for those who work in jobs whose tasks are augmented by AI rather than automated by AI.
“AI will be more of a complement to workers versus a substitute,” McQueen said. “If you are static, then you might get replaced, not because of AI, but because you haven’t upgraded your skill set.”

He said employers should also adapt, including by training their employees on new skills.
 Opportunity in AI transformation

McQueen and others say that alongside the change AI brings is opportunity. McQueen points to the Full Employment Council, which recently completed a staffing search for a Northland data center.
“They are offering jobs to like 75 to 100 people,” said McQueen. “Those jobs are paying like $23 an hour, so they’re not cheap jobs.”
Data centers are springing up all over the country to house the hardware needed to power and process the large data sets needed for generative AI. Despite environmental concerns, companies have invested $40 billion in the U.S. on new data center construction between June 2024 and June 2025, according to Reuters.
Mychal Shaw, founder of Uwazi.ai, a Kansas City-based startup that looks to use AI to promote civic engagement, said that there will be short-term challenges as AI implementation scales up, but that those challenges will ultimately be worth it.
“I think we are in the Industrial Revolution phase,” Shaw said. “AI is going to be the biggest disrupter in a positive way.”
Shaw said that the change AI represents is bigger than the implementation of the internet, email and smartphones combined. He said AI has grown exponentially and will continue to as AI large language models can be used to produce even more specifically targeted large language models.
That big of a change is naturally scary, Shaw said, but AI can be used to upskill yourself. He said he taught himself to code during the pandemic but has used AI tools to advance his skills and to help build his startup.
“The fun thing about AI is the opportunity to advance your mindset, your skill set, those things, those (tools) will all be available to you,” Shaw said. “They’re a lot more accessible now than they were even just five years ago. I say that particularly to minority communities who historically have not had that available. AI is a tool that allows you to catch up.”
Bassett said that AI can also level the playing field between larger and smaller companies.
“AI acts as the great equalizer,” Bassett said. “It allows a five-person team in Manhattan, Kansas, to compete with a 500-person team in Manhattan, New York.”
Mark Esposito, professor of economics and strategy at both Hult International Business School and Harvard University, told the Kansas economic conference that over the next 50 years the economy will see a shift in value from labor production to learning systems like AI.
“The future economy will be built on algorithms, not assembly lines,” Esposito said. “AI as a new factor of production is really the new horizon of competitiveness.”
 How to adapt as a worker

For Kansas City workers currently in jobs that are exposed to AI automation, Escalera said to focus on increasing skills in aspects of your job that can’t be automated. That could eventually mean a pivot in job titles like moving from a customer service representative to a customer experience specialist who strategizes how to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Bassett and Shaw said white-collar workers may have no choice but to adopt the use of AI.
“I think it takes a conscious investment, especially in the white-collar space, to educate yourself on utilizing AI properly, because it can actually maximize your productivity,” Shaw said. “That makes you, in a way, unfireable.”
Bassett says that AI can’t replace strategy, vision, taste, relationship building or emotional intelligence — among many other innately human qualities — and that honing those skills will give you a leg up. He advocates for adopting AI use over time, familiarizing yourself with models incrementally, to rid yourself of repetitive “busy work.”
“Become a director, not a doer,” Bassett said. “If your day is all task work, you’re just doing AI’s job of tomorrow. In a couple of years AI is going to be doing 99% of that to-do list and doing it better than you.”
McQueen said that no matter your field you must continue to grow and hone your skills to remain competitive. If you work in a field that uses AI — the Full Employment Council also connects people to jobs that are largely unaffected by AI, like the trades — you’ll need to adapt or risk being left behind.
“AI means a market adjustment in terms of your skills and the job that you perform,” McQueen said. “You’ve got to plan for the market to adjust. It’s not going to be the same.”

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature video)TOPEKA — The first audit under expanded powers from the Kansas inspector general’s office identified more than a dozen problems within organizations providing health care through Kansas’ Medicaid program.
The audit is just the beginning of a campaign to weed out fraud and inefficiencies within social welfare programs, following the 2025 Legislature’s approval of broadening the office’s authority to encompass oversight of cash, food and health assistance.
Steven Anderson, the state inspector general, presented 17 findings with accompanying recommendations based on hospital complaints about delays, discrepancies and a potential conflict of interest. He spoke to the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency at an Oct. 21 hearing. 
The audit analyzed hospital complaints from 2023 to determine whether organizations prolonged reviews, manipulated patient statuses and lacked consistency in determining post-visit levels of care. The audit also identified a potential conflict of interest within United Healthcare, one of three managed care organizations that have offered services under KanCare, as Medicaid is known in Kansas.
The inspector general’s office, which is housed within the Kansas Attorney General’s Office, interviewed staff at six Kansas hospitals, representatives from the three KanCare managed care organizations at the time of the report, staff from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, and representatives from the Kansas Hospital Association. KDHE agreed with most, but not all, of the audit’s recommendations.
The audit found that managed care organizations refused to reimburse claims that involved returns to a hospital within 30 days of the initial visit, even if the visits were unrelated.
The hospitals typically eat those costs, Anderson said.
“It’s probably incalculable how much money is lost through all this,” said Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican.
The percentage of denied claims for hospital services across the organizations averaged 6% in 2023. However, the value of hospital service claim denials makes up a disproportionate amount of all denials.
One organization denied $1.8 billion in claims in 2023. Hospital claim denials made up 70%, or $1.3 billion, of those denials. Another denied $1.02 billion in claims, and hospital denials accounted for 69%, or $707 million. The third organization denied $1.8 billion in claims, and hospital denials accounted for 62% or $1.1 million.
Anderson said the amounts have grown larger every year.
“The reality is, if I’m going to deny claims, I’m going to look for the higher-dollar ones,” he said. “We can draw some conclusions, maybe, that they were approving the smaller-dollar ones, but the big money ones were oftentimes denied.”
The audit also found that United Healthcare used its proprietary health care criteria and billing system to judge its own claims.
“So they own the process from front to back,” Anderson said.
He said the organization “controls so much of the narrative,” and United Healthcare’s use of a system owned by one of its subsidiaries “looks bad on the surface.”
However, he acknowledged his office cannot prove United Healthcare uses its system inappropriately. KDHE said in a response in the audit that state Medicaid programs must follow certain conflict of interest provisions, “but to date, United acquiring billing and other health care companies and continuing to use those products is not a conflict per the current standards.”
The tools were used by all three contracted organizations at the time, KDHE said. Trying to restrict United Healthcare’s use of the systems and allowing other organizations to continue would create “additional dynamics.”
“These tools are widely used and accepted by healthcare providers across the nation to make medical decisions and validate claims,” KDHE said.
Anderson said his office, the managed care organizations and KDHE are scheduling a meeting to discuss the audit’s findings.
“I’m thrilled to hear that,” said Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican and chairwoman of the committee.
The best solution, she said, is to get stakeholders together to sort out their differences.
“I always say, if you want the Legislature to do it, no one’s going to be happy with that fix,” she said, “so I’d rather the entities get together and work it out.”
Ultimately, the audit poses the question of whether the state’s contracts reflect what Kansans need, Erickson said.
Upcoming audits span government assistance programs, according to Anderson. One examines data sharing between the state agencies that oversee KanCare and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to verify eligibility for those programs based on comparing residency, household composition and income reporting. Anderson promoted another audit that will look at what he called the pregnant women program to identify whether those accessing it qualify.
The state facilitates the Special Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children, often called WIC, which would fall under Anderson’s purview.
He said his office also plans to release audits of Kansas’ waiver programs, which assist elderly and disabled Kansans through Medicaid, and the pharmaceutical drug program, which is also operated through Medicaid.
Sen. Michael Murphy, a Republican from Sylvia in Reno County, commended Anderson’s work.
“I’m a simple guy,” Murphy said, “and I think when you find you have a hole in the fence, you shouldn’t be surprised when the cows get out.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251021_anderson-1024x597.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 09:57:26.093244

Mike Braun this week puts in motion a statewide task force that aims to make Indiana a national leader in drone research, manufacturing and security technology.
The new “Indiana Initiative for Drone Dominance Task Force” will coordinate work across government, universities and private industry to support federal efforts to strengthen U.S. leadership in drone technology and airspace security.

“Indiana has always stepped up to use our skills and labor to support America’s defense,” Braun said in a statement announcing the order. “Indiana’s advanced manufacturing capacity and our concentration of defense and research assets make us uniquely suited to lead in America’s pursuit of drone dominance, and this new Task Force will position Indiana as a national asset and drive innovation in this important sector.”
Braun developed the executive order in collaboration with Republican U.S. Sen. Todd Young, who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee and has worked on drone policy at the federal level.
“Drones are increasingly critical to our economy and national security, and as a leading manufacturing state, Indiana is positioned to help unleash American drone dominance,” Young said in a statement.
“Over the past several months, my team has worked hand in hand with Governor Braun’s team on developing this executive order,” he continued. “Governor Braun has been a great partner on this issue, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Governor and Hoosier stakeholders to support the President’s executive order and empower the U.S. drone industry.”

The task force will draw on the state’s “robust advanced manufacturing industry, expertise from NSWC Crane, restricted airspace over assets like Camp Atterbury and Muscatatuck Urban Training Center, strong policy framework, and universities with established programs to further drone research and development,” according to Braun’s office.
Priorities include developing a cross-sector aerial test corridor linking those sites; expanding public safety uses of unmanned aircraft during major events; strengthening Indiana’s drone-manufacturing supply chain; and supporting workforce training programs with colleges and universities.
Federal officials said the North American drone market is estimated to reach $59 billion by 2030.
The task force must deliver its strategic plan and recommendations to the governor by July 31, 2026.

(Photo by Linda Shaw/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service)When a young Sealaska intern walking a beach in July 2022 found the first evidence of European green crab presence in Alaska – a discarded shell on a beach on Annette Island in the state’s far southeast corner – it was an ominous sign about the invasive species’ northward spread.
Since then, the Metlakatla Indian Community, the tribe based on Annette Island, and its partners, which include Alaska Sea Grant, have found not just more shells, but live invasive crabs. Discoveries numbered just a handful at first, then dozens, then hundreds, then thousands.
This year, the Metlakatla tribe’s team has trapped more than 40,000 of them on and around Annette Island, a representative said.
“This year we’ve had a complete explosion of green crab — over seven new locations on Annette Island we found green crab, and eight new locations off Annette Island,” said Nicole Reynolds, an environmental specialist working with the tribe, in a presentation at a three-day Anchorage meeting on invasive species in Alaska this week.
The more than 40,000 crabs removed this year compares to last year’s total of 1,800, Reynolds said.
European green crabs are small, usually measuring no more than 4 inches wide, but they  are powerful forces of destruction. They mow down eelgrass beds that are vital habitat for salmon and other native species. And they gobble up native marine life like juvenile salmon, clams, mussels and juvenile Dungeness and other crabs that are important to commercial and subsistence harvests.
“They’ll eat the baby crabs. They’re meaner and tougher than the Dungeness,” Reynolds said during a break in the annual Alaska Invasive Species Partnership Workshop.
European green crabs have already spread north of Annette Island. Last year, they were found at Gravina Island, and this summer they were found by participants in a local university class at beaches in Ketchikan that lie about 30 miles north of the initial Annette Island discovery site.
Just this month, they were found at Etolin Island, Reynolds said. Etolin Island is roughly 60 miles northwest of the city of Ketchikan, making it the northernmost North America discovery to date.
And now European green crabs appear to be entrenched in Alaska waters for good, Reynolds and Genelle Winter, a grant administrator with the tribal government, told the workshop audience.
That means the fight against green crabs will also have to be long-term, Winter said, with a permanent staff and a strategy of what is known as “functional eradication.” That is an eradication strategy that accepts the reality of the invaders’ presence in some places, but tries to keep them out of other places with resources that are most important to protect.

Reynolds and Winter presented information at the annual Alaska Invasive Species Partnership Workshop in Anchorage about the Tribe’s work to combat the spread of European green crabs.

	Such a strategy involves “focusing all our efforts on protecting the most vital subsistence and commercial resources,” she said.
Conditions in Alaska waters, the farthest-north spots in North America where the crabs have spread, do not faze the invaders, DNA analysis shows. For that information, the tribe consulted with an expert, Carolyn Tepolt of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. Tepolt has also been investigating the genetics of green crabs that have invaded Washington state.
Tepolt’s analysis found that the green crabs in Alaska are a genetic blend of those in Washington and British Columbia, diverse enough to persist in the more northern waters, Reynolds said.
“She even called it a ‘super-crab’ just because of how perfectly genetically suited it is for the environment in Southeast Alaska,” Reynolds said.
European green crabs have been altering North American marine ecosystems for a long time.
They were first found in East Coast waters in the early 1800s, likely carried there in ship ballast water. The first West Coast discovery was in 1989 in San Francisco Bay. Since then, they have been spreading north up the Pacific coast. They were first confirmed in British Columbia in 1999 and continued moving up that Canadian province’s coast before being found at Annette Island three years ago.
Beyond the accidental releases through ballast water, scientists say warming conditions are aiding the spread of green crabs. Larvae are more likely to survive in warmer waters brought on by climate change and weather events like El Nino cycles.
The 2023-2024 El Nino, which warmed Alaska waters, is a possible factor in this year’s explosion of green crabs in Southeast Alaska, the Metlakatla tribal representatives said.
Warmer temperatures than those that used to be normal in Alaska marine waters are known to encourage green crab proliferation.
A study by Danish scienetists that was published in September identifies a temperature range that appears ideal for the crabs. At temperatures of 12.5 to 16.6 degrees Celsius, or 54.5 to 61.9 degrees Fahrenheit, European green crab abundance peaked, the scientists found.
Average temperatures in Southcentral Alaska’s Cook Inlet were within that range this August, an indication that conditions would be suitable for green crabs if they somehow reach that area.

	Preparations are already underway in Alaska for what experts believe is an inevitable spread north from the Southeast region.
In Southcentral Alaska’s Kachemak Bay, over 700 miles northwest of Ketchikan, residents this summer deployed over 60 traps in what was effectively a pre-invasion drill. The program was a cooperative effort of the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, the Seldovia Village Tribe and its council member, Michael Opheim, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
There and elsewhere, a big part of the fight against green crab infestations is public education.
European green crabs can be identified by the array of bumps on their shells. They have five sharp spikes on either side of their eyes and three lobes in between their eyes. Despite their name, they are not always green – they can be red, yellow or mottled. Some of those found by her team have even been blue, Reynolds said.
To help boost awareness, local Tsimshian artist Elizabeth Anderson has designed a green crab logo – with an angry face to reinforce the message that the species is a bad actor, Winter said.
In Metlakatla, awareness appears to be keen already, including among some of the youngest residents.
“The other day, the mayor was driving down the street and got flagged down by two little kids. And they said, ‘We found some green crab! We know its green crab because it’s 5-3-5,’” Winter said during the workshop presentation. The numbers reference the array of shell bumps on a green crab. “Those little kids absolutely knew how to identify the European green crab.”
Those crabs, found at a beach right in front of town, were stashed in a plastic bag and added to this year’s count, Winter said.
Aside from identifying, trapping, counting, measuring and analyzing the European green crabs, the inundated community faces another challenge: what to do with thousands of unwanted invaders.
In Metlakatla, the ultimate destination is the community compost heap. That is a good end use, Reynolds said. “They add heat to the compost, and because it’s cold and wet in Southeast, it’s actually really helpful to have more heat,” she told workshop attendees.
On the East Coast and elsewhere, some of the eradication work involves eating the invaders. Experts say they have little meat but can be useful for making soups. One organization, Greencrab.org, has compiled recipes and sells a cookbook and T-shirts with a catchy slogan: “If you can’t beat them, eat them.”

Although they are called green crabs, they come in different colors, and heat can turn their shells orange.

Delaware Court of Chancery Delivers Opinion on Split-Rate Property Taxes
WILMINGTON, Del. — The Delaware Court of Chancery has delivered its opinion regarding the Delaware General Assembly’s controversial move to permit split-rate property taxes, upholding the legislature’s authority to enact the law. The ruling marks a significant moment in Delaware’s ongoing debate over property taxation and its impact on residents and local governments.
In a decision released Thursday, Vice Chancellor Jane Smith wrote that the General Assembly acted within its constitutional powers when passing legislation that allows municipalities to set different tax rates for land and for buildings. The split-rate system, proponents argue, encourages development by lowering taxes on improvements while maintaining or increasing rates on land, thereby discouraging speculation and blight.
“The General Assembly possesses broad discretion in matters of taxation, so long as it does not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection and fairness,” Smith stated in the court’s opinion. “The split-rate property tax law falls within these bounds, offering municipalities a flexible approach to local fiscal policy.”
Opponents of the law, including a coalition of property owners and advocacy groups, had challenged the measure, claiming it unfairly burdens landholders and could lead to unpredictable changes in tax bills. The court, however, found that the legislature had conducted sufficient study and public hearings before enacting the law, and that the split-rate structure does not constitute unlawful discrimination.
A Lose-Lose Proposition for Residents
The judgment is being viewed by many as a “lose-lose” proposition for county residents. If the court had ruled with the plaintiffs, taxes on homeowners would have increased, as rates reverted back to the original reassessment values prior to the General Assembly’s actions on September 12 and subsequent interventions by the school boards. However, since the judge ruled against the plaintiffs, the revised tax structure will disproportionately affect corporately-owned rental properties, leading to higher rents for many low-income families. As a result, the financial strain on renters could be significant, amplifying concerns about housing affordability in New Castle County.
As a result of the decision, New Castle County is freed to issue revised property tax invoices to all county property owners.  At this time, the bills remain due on November 30, 2025.
Legislators Call on New Castle County to Repeat the Property Reassessment Process
In the wake of today’s Delaware Chancery Court decision upholding a proposed two-tier system of property taxation, two Delaware State Representatives are calling for New Castle County to repeat its property reassessment process, maintaining the previous evaluations and tax rates in the interim.
State Reps. Kevin Hensley (Townsend, Odessa, Port Penn) and Mike Smith (R-Pike Creek Valley) say the best path forward is for New Castle County to take a “mulligan” and repeat the process. Both legislators sit on the House Special Property Reassessment Committee and have been taking part in a joint investigation of the county’s flawed outcome.
“Regardless of whether we have a one-tier or two-tier system of tax rates is kind of beside the point,” Rep. Hensley said. “The property valuations on which those taxes are based are badly flawed. For instance, at the first committee meeting, we learned that there was no differentiation between preserved farmland and farmland not in the preservation program, even though there is a huge difference between the two.”
Rep. Smith agreed that New Castle County residents have no trust in what’s been produced. “Even under the standards used by Tyler Technologies, we know that many commercial properties were severely undervalued. Some properties vanished during the process or had major components that were left unassessed. Even if we have an extended and thorough appeals process, that would only potentially correct overvalued assets. No one who owns undervalued properties will be appealing those decisions. Leaving the owners of commercial properties to pay less than their fair share means homeowners will collectively pay more. No one should find that acceptable.”
State House Minority Whip Jeff Spiegelman (R-Townsend, Smyrna, Clayton), who works in the commercial real estate industry, echoed the thoughts of his caucus members. “Taxation, like any government institution, is based on public faith. I’ve seen some of the commercial property valuations produced by this process and, even having insight into the market that most people lack, I can’t make the numbers work. The fact the legislature took the extraordinary step of meeting in a special session and is now conducting a joint probe of what went wrong emphasizes what we all already know: The public has no confidence that the reassessment was done well or fairly.”
All three legislators note the county’s 2024 reassessment resulted from the settlement of a 2020 lawsuit filed by a coalition of groups. The plaintiffs successfully claimed that the lack of contemporary valuations had created disparities in public education funding. Prior to the legal action, New Castle County last conducted an assessment in 1983. Delaware’s other two counties, which were also sued and entered into separate settlements, had also not reassessed in decades.
“This reassessment was only done to address the unequal property tax burdens placed on homeowners and business owners,” Rep. Hensley said. “I would argue that the county’s latest efforts have done nothing to correct the situation. It’s just produced a different pattern of inequities.”
Rep. Smith said there is only one acceptable remedy. “We need to toss the most recent reassessment, continue the investigation, learn from the mistakes that were made, observe the best practices employed by Kent and Sussex counties, and redo this thing. In the meantime, use the old valuations and tax rates.”
Both Reps. Hensley and Smith said they would work across the aisle with other members of the House and Senate Special Property Reassessment Committees to make their proposal a reality, including the potential for the state to finance a portion of the work.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6374e3fe79e83.image_.jpg,,,2025-10-31 09:16:31.385728

As millions of low-income Californians — most of whom are children and senior citizens — brace for the absence of federal food benefits starting Saturday, local officials, schools and organizations are scrambling to provide support for their communities.
More than 5.5 million Californians depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as CalFresh in the state, for food. California issues about $1.1 billion in CalFresh benefits every month, but due to the federal government shutdown — soon entering its second month — benefits for November have been delayed. 
In San Francisco, Mayor Daniel Lurie on Wednesday said the city will cover food benefits through the month of November for its nearly 112,000 CalFresh residents. Some of the money comes from a $400-million reserve set up by San Francisco lawmakers to cover possible cuts from federal and state governments, according to KQED.
Staff at California K-12 schools and colleges are also stocking up food pantries and connecting students with local food resources, reports EdSource. San Jose State University, for example, is urging students specifically affected by CalFresh delays to request assistance, and Chico State is offering free meals for food stamp recipients.
Some restaurants in the Bay Area and Los Angeles County are also offering free food to children and seniors, including bowls of pho in Oakland and shelf-stable snacks in Lynwood. 
Meanwhile, food banks — already stretched thin since the pandemic and affected by federal and state funding cuts — are preparing for the surge in demand. In Shasta County, nearly one in five residents are on food stamps. The county’s food bank is ordering more food through funds the state set aside to support food banks, reports Shasta Scout. But concerns of being overwhelmed remain.
At the state level, Gov. Gavin Newsom deployed the California National Guard and allocated $80 million to assist food banks. California is also suing President Donald Trump’s administration to use emergency funds to cover food benefits.

Who’s spending the most on Prop. 50?

All three of the campaign committees on Proposition 50 — one Yes on Prop. 50, and two No on Prop. 50 — are pouring millions of dollars for their causes, with the Yes campaign outspending and outraising its opponents. But groups not directly affiliated with these campaigns are also pouring big bucks, known as independent expenditures, to influence voters.
As CalMatters’ Jeremia Kimelman explains, anybody can advocate their position on a California ballot measure as long as they follow certain rules, including registering with a state committee, and not coordinating with the primary campaigns.
Entities such as nonprofits, political parties and independent billionaires have reported spending nearly $26 million as of Oct. 30 to pay for ads, mailers and canvassers to promote their stances on the redistricting measure. 
The largest spenders outside Prop. 50’s campaigns are billionaire Democrat Tom Steyer, who reported more than $12.8 million in expenditures, as well as the California Republican Party, which reported more than $10.2 million.
More than two dozen county parties and current and former elected officials have also reported spending more than $1 million in total for Prop. 50. Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, a San Diego Republican, spent more than $430,000 from his Reform California committee to oppose Prop. 50 because he didn’t “trust the failed consultants of these mega-committees.”

DeMaio: “My intuition was correct. The ads were horsesh–t, off message.”

OpenAI wants to change things up

Artificial intelligence company OpenAI said Tuesday that it plans to restructure as both a nonprofit foundation and a for-profit company after it received approval from California Attorney General Rob Bonta. But concerns remain that the move could set a precedent for the company and others to misuse certain tax benefits, report CalMatters’ Khari Johnson and Levi Sumagaysay.
Originally launched as a nonprofit in 2015, the California-based creator of ChatGPT moved forward with plans last year to set up a for-profit public benefit corporation. The shift would remove certain barriers for raising money, as well as conflict-of-interest issues between its nonprofit and for-profit arms.
Bonta opened an investigation into the restructuring to ensure the company abided with its original stated mission, which was to make artificial intelligence that benefits humanity. He ultimately gave the proposal his blessing on Monday.
But critics say the reorg could allow OpenAI to reap the benefits of charitable tax exemptions, and that even though its nonprofit arm is nominally in control of the for-profit entity, the for-profit company could end up pulling the strings.

In a ruling issued Oct. 23, Circuit Judge Cotton Walker said administrative law judges, who work in the Division of Workers’ Compensation and hear disputes over claims, are not entitled to any more job or pay protections than any other state employee.
The decision means former state Rep. Gina Mitten of Richmond Heights, who was appointed as an administrative law judge in 2021 and fired in May 2024, will not get her job back. And Ryan Asbridge, appointed in 2019 but on active duty with the Air Force since 2021, will receive only three weeks of pay each year while away from his state duties.
Mitten and Asbridge filed the lawsuit in August 2024. Andy Hirth, the attorney for Mitten and Asbridge, said they will appeal the decision.
“We basically think that the courts found in favor of the state contrary to the plain language of Missouri statutes,” Hirth said.
In the lawsuit, Mitten argued that state law is clear that administrative law judges can only be discharged or removed if three of five members on a review committee vote no confidence after two successive performance audits two years apart.
Walker disagreed, pointing to another state law that states employees of the executive branch “may be discharged for no reason or any reason not prohibited by law.”
The law for biennial performance reviews, Walker said, “does not limit the executive branch’s appointing authority by prohibiting the unilateral termination of employment of an ALJ with or without cause.”
Around the same time division Director Pamela Lewis fired Mitten, she informed Asbridge that the department would no longer pay his entire salary of approximately $120,000 a year while he was deployed with the Air Force. Asbridge had received approximately $335,000 in pay while away from his state duties.
Asbridge received no other payments after he received a new deployment in June 2024 until after Oct. 1, 2024, the start of the federal fiscal year, when the state paid him salary for three weeks.
In the lawsuit, Asbridge argued that because his salary is set by statute, the state must pay him regardless of hours worked. The lawsuit cited an attorney general’s opinion from 1998. 
Walker, however, ruled that Asbridge’s pay status is governed by a law that allows 120 hours of pay for employees and officers of the state on leave to perform active duty with the National Guard or other armed forces.
“Asbridge is entitled to 120 hours, or three weeks’ pay, per federal fiscal year during his
leave of absence for military duties,” Walker wrote. The department “could pay him more, up to his full salary, but the law does not require this of (the department).”
Mitten, a Democrat, was a member of the Missouri House from 2013 to 2021. She is seeking nomination for the state Senate in the 4th District in 2026.
Mitten could not be reached for comment.
Asbridge, who is listed among the 26 administrative law judges, remains on active duty and has received orders extending his service to at least August 2025, Hirth said.
The decision, if it stands, has implications for every executive branch employee, he said.
“The language of that ruling is so broad,” Hirth said, “that if that is right, then the governor of Missouri can fire any employee from any commission including the Missouri Ethics Commission, Administrative Hearing Commission or anywhere.”

Re: “Protecting Jewish students or chilling speech? Inside California’s ‘hardest’ fight over antisemitism”
When Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 715 into law on the solemn second anniversary of the deadliest attack against Jews since the Holocaust, California declared that every child deserves to feel safe in our schools.
For years, Jewish students in California have shared painful stories: slurs shouted in hallways, swastikas drawn on desks, lessons that distort Jewish history. These aren’t isolated incidents. Antisemitic acts in California schools have surged 623% in the last decade, according to the ADL. 
AB 715 creates the nation’s first statewide antisemitism prevention coordinator, a position dedicated to helping schools respond to incidents, train educators, track data and recommend future reforms. It also requires swift responses when bias occurs and promotes inclusive learning environments so that all students can learn without fear. 
None of this should be controversial. The bill ultimately passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
This victory was years in the making. Assemblymembers Rick Chavez Zbur and Dawn Addis worked closely with the Jewish, Black , Latino and AAPI caucuses — backed by the largest coalition of Jewish organizations ever assembled for Capitol legislation. After three different bills, countless amendments and feedback from education leaders, civil-rights advocates and legislators of every background, the north star for this two-year effort was protecting students.
The tenacity of this coalition was tested at every turn. The state’s largest teachers’ union ultimately opposed the bill for “prioritizing one form of discrimination over others,” yet education union leaders refused to answer basic questions about whether antisemitism was a problem in schools.
Despite these challenges, California passed a law that affirms both academic freedom and equal protection, ensuring classroom discussion remains open while discrimination is not tolerated. It sends a statement to Jewish families that the state stands by them.
Now comes the next phase: ensuring this law fulfills its promise. Training must be substantive, not perfunctory. Reporting must be transparent. Accountability must be real. Our community will be there every step of the way.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/082625_ScienceClass_FM_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-31 08:56:45.877924

(Photo by Susan Tebben/Ohio Capital Journal)A new map was introduced Thursday at the second meeting of the Ohio Redistricting Commission, one that leaders say was a compromise between the Democrats and Republicans on the commission.
A vote could happen at the meeting scheduled for Friday morning, though commission members did not indicate whether or not they had a unanimous vote as of Thursday.
“This is the process working,” said State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, also the co-chair of the commission.
“There are pros and cons to all different aspects of this process, but I think those legislators did what the constitution envisions, which is accept those pros and cons and come to an agreement.”
The newest map would create a state with 12 Republican-leaning districts and three Democratic-leaning districts, increasing the Republican districts in the state from the current 10-5 map.
The commission has until Oct. 31 to approve a bipartisan map, or the process goes back to the Ohio General Assembly.
The districts that would change most significantly under the new map would be those of Democratic congress members, including U.S. Reps. Marcy Kaptur, Greg Landsman and Emilia Sykes.
Landsman’s 1st district would lean Republican with a 54% to 47% breakdown. Kaptur’s 9th district would lean Republican with a 54.5% to 45.5% Republican to Democrat ratio.
Sykes’ 13th district would lean Democratic, 52% to 48% Republican, according to data provided by the commission.
The biggest gap is in the 4th district, held by Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, which breaks down to 72% Republican and 29% Democratic. The Democrats see a 78% advantage in the 11th district, held currently by Democratic U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown.
Minority Leader Nickie Antonio led most of the meeting, which was punctuated by complaints from the crowd and one person who was escorted out by security.
Antonio would not say which way she was planning to vote on the map, but emphasized the flaws in the redistricting system.
“We have a broken system of redistricting, I think that bears out in the testimony we heard today as well,” Antonio said after the meeting. “It was not what the voters expected when in 2018 we voted to end gerrymandering.”
Antonio said the process is down to the “11th hour” in that system.
“This system that we have, in the long-run, is probably going to be need to be fixed again, but today, we have to look at the best way to go forward with our congressional maps because we are required to do that,” she said.

Gov. Mike DeWine told reporters Thursday that he supported the map as presented, noting he got a look at the map early Wednesday. He said it was a welcome compromise between the two sides.
“The goal here was to get maps and get Democrats on board with the map, it would appear that that’s going to happen,” DeWine said.
DeWine didn’t attend Thursday’s meeting, but met with reporters in the hallway as the meeting went on to discuss action on SNAP funding and redistricting.
“What Republicans will get out of this is a sure map, that will be done, both sides get that,” DeWine said. “These are all negotiations and in negotiations no one gets what they want.”
The commission has now met twice since reconvening last week, with the first meeting covering consideration for the legislative Democrats’ map proposal. That proposal would have split the state into eight Republican-leaning districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts. The Democrats said this map was based on voting trends for the last 10 years in the state.
Republicans on both the Joint Committee on Congressional Redistricting, which met in September, and the commission dismissed the map as an unfair gerrymander, and questioned the use of the election results as a measure for what the partisan breakdown of the state should be.
Stewart presented the newest map to the commission on Thursday, saying the proposal “complies with ‘one person, one vote,’” as 13 districts have the same population, and the other two districts are only off by one individual in each district.

Members of the public who came to speak at the commission hearing on Thursday continued a familiar complaint throughout the renewed redistricting process, shaming Republicans for not showing up with a map earlier than October, and further decrying the process as a closed-door, unaccountable method of redrawing the districts that establish the members of Congress who will represent Ohioans on Capitol Hill.
Some shed tears, expressing anger and frustration and calling the process “just one big sham.”
“We are gathered here again, with less than 48 hours before this commission is expected to have produced something more than political theater,” said Dayton resident Zachary Gibbs. “And yet, the drama continues.”
Even self-identified Republican Paul Miller, who has spent his testimony in previous redistricting hearings over the years highly criticizing Democrats, had notes about the map.
“In the past we’ve had the ‘snake on the lake,’ and you’ve turned it into an elephant,” Miller said. “…The map is crap, that’s all.”
Jen Miller of the League of Women Voters of Ohio said the actions of the commission make clear “the politicians on the Ohio Redistricting Commission don’t care about voters or good government.”
“The public was shut out, the process rigged and incumbents favored,” Miller said in a statement. “The resulting congressional map still doesn’t reflect the will of the voters of Ohio.”
Stewart had previously said he saw no point in bringing forth a map without assurances that it would have bipartisan support, which is why the Republicans hadn’t released a map until now.
The Thursday meeting announcement came almost exactly 24 hours before the meeting was to be held, and the GOP map wasn’t released to the public until Thursday’s hearing.
Another meeting is scheduled for Friday morning, the same day as the deadline the state constitution gives the commission to adopt a bipartisan map.
Maps can be challenged through the Ohio Supreme Court after they’re passed, and there is talk of a possible referendum to once again challenge the redistricting process in the state. If a map is passed by the commission, a referendum can’t be attempted.
If no agreement comes from the commission, the map comes back to the Ohio General Assembly, where the Republican supermajority would have an easier time passing a map because it’s only required to obtain a simple majority.
But passage by the General Assembly would open up the map for potential referendum, to keep the current map in place for now.

SB 21, sponsored by Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, would require candidates for most political offices to be “natural born citizens” of the United States. Those offices include governor and lieutenant governor; state legislators, civil and criminal judges, attorney general and secretary of state, and local sheriffs and district attorneys.

Chesteen said in an interview Thursday that he is not worried about constitutional challenges, despite the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteeing equal protection to all citizens, naturalized and native-born.
“The language in the bill speaks for what it’s trying to accomplish,” Chesteen said. “I don’t want to make this anything more complicated than it is.”
According to the American Immigration Council, about 77,300 Alabama residents were naturalized citizens in 2023, about 1.5% of the state’s population. 
The amendment came from Secretary of State Wes Allen, Chesteen said. Currently, the only office that requires a candidate to be a natural-born citizen is President of the United States. Allen said in a release Monday that the requirement should apply to state government officials.
“For the same reasons our founding fathers sought to ensure that our nation’s leader was a natural born American citizen, we believe the same standard must be required of those operating in the highest levels of our state government,” Allen said. 
Currently, Alabama law requires the governor and lieutenant governor to be U.S. citizens for 10 years; the secretary of state, treasurer, and commissioner of agriculture for seven years; and state lawmakers for three years, according to the bill. Other constitutional offices do not have a specified length of citizenship requirement.
No state requires all constitutional office holders to be natural born citizens. Chesteen wants Alabama to be the first.
“I don’t think it’s ever been challenged before. There’s a first time for everything,” Chesteen said. “We’ll try to move the bill through the legislative process. If it’s challenged, it’s challenged.”
Until a repeal in 1955, Maine required its governor to be a natural born citizen. It was amended to require U.S. citizenship for 15 years.
Only one immigrant has served as Alabama governor. Robert Lindsey, who was born in Scotland and came to the United States when he was 20, served as governor from 1870 to 1872.
While nobody is entitled to a right to hold office, every citizen has the right to run for office under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, according to a University of Pennsylvania law review. 
The review quoted a 1969 U.S. Supreme Court case that originated in New York, 1969 Kramer v. Union Free School District No. 15.
“Statutes granting the franchise to residents on a selective basis always pose the danger of denying some citizens any effective voice in the governmental affairs which substantially affect their lives,” the opinion said. “Therefore, if a challenged state statute grants the right to vote to some bona fide residents of requisite age and citizenship and denies the franchise to others, the Court must determine whether the exclusions are necessary to promote a compelling state interest.”
Pam Karlan, a professor of law at Stanford Law School, said in an interview Thursday that beyond the unconstitutionality of the proposal, there is a question of what a natural born citizen is. People born in Indian tribes are considered citizens at birth since a law passed in 1924, she said, as well as children born outside the country to parents who are U.S. citizens.
“As a matter of morality and policy, this is a truly evil proposal, because some of some of our most distinguished citizens over time have been people who were immigrants to the United States,” Karlan said. “This idea that even if the people of Alabama think that one of these people who’s an immigrant would be the best governor or be the best state legislator, they’re prevented from voting for this person by this law that says, well, because you weren’t born here, your citizenship is not good enough. It’s really kind of staggering.”
She said that regardless of what type of citizenship somebody has, they are protected equally under the Fourteenth Amendment and seen as citizens of the U.S.
“I don’t see the constitutional argument for why it is okay to treat these groups differently,” Karlan said. “On top of that, I don’t see any normative argument for why you would want to treat them differently, other than, to my mind, nativism. That is really quite inconsistent with American values.”
If 60% of both houses of the Legislature approves the bill, it must get a majority approval from voters to be added to the Alabama Constitution. Currently, the Republican party holds 71% of the Legislature in both chambers. Chesteen said he has talked with the Republican caucus and the members are supportive of the bill. 
“It could be a challenge working the bill through both sides of the aisle, but we’ll get to work on it in session,” he said. 
The 2026 Legislative session begins in January.
Chesteen said he has concerns about naturalized citizens in other states running for office, but did not specify who or which offices. He said he is not aware of any such candidate in Alabama.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC02190-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 08:16:31.620504
,California,2025-10-31 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Even California’s iconic industries are cutting back in this sluggish economy,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/california-sluggish-economy-cutbacks/,Technology companies and Hollywood corporations are laying off thousands. The only job growth is in government and healthcare.,"As Gov. Gavin Newsom ramps up what appears to be a 2028 White House bid, a mainstay of his pitch during television interviews and social media appearances is California’s economy.
As Newsom tells it, the state’s $4-trillion-plus annual economic output is not only the fourth largest in the world, were it a nation, but it’s a model of entrepreneurial vigor and programs  advancing equity.
Were it only true.
A year ago, the Legislature’s budget analyst, Gabe Petek, indirectly blew the whistle on Newsom’s braggadocio.
“California’s economy has been in an extended slowdown for the better part of two years, characterized by a soft labor market and weak consumer spending,” Petek wrote while outlining the state’s deficit-ridden budget dilemma.
“While this slowdown has been gradual and the severity milder than a recession, a look at recent economic data paints a picture of a sluggish economy. Outside of government and health care, the state has added no jobs in a year and a half.”
Nothing has changed since then. Employment has been stuck at virtually the same level for a couple of years. At 5.5%, California’s unemployment rate is the highest of any state, with more than a million workers lacking jobs.
Meanwhile, the state has been overspending its revenues, creating what budget experts call a “structural deficit,” meaning spending programs locked into law are greater than the reliable income to fund them.
California really can’t afford those compassionate services Newsom boasts about creating. He and the Legislature, amid great fanfare, extended state-paid medical care to undocumented immigrants, only to be forced to roll it back after costs turned out to be double their estimate.
It should be noted that what Petek saw a year ago, and remains fundamentally true today, pre-dates Donald Trump’s becoming president, so blaming him, which Newsom attempted earlier this year, is groundless.
One of the most troubling aspects of California’s wheel-spinning economy is the turmoil in two revered sectors, high technology in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California’s movie and television production industry.
Silicon Valley has been shedding jobs for the past several years as it shifts emphasis to artificial intelligence. This weeks’ announcement that Amazon is cutting 14,000 jobs  — and may eventually double that number as it focuses on AI — was a jolt.
Not all of those cuts are in California, of course, but the online seller has been heavily involved in California, operating multiple warehouses.
 “We expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains,” Beth Galetti, Amazon’s senior vice president of people experience, said in a memo to employees.
Meanwhile, the Paramount production conglomerate, a mainstay of the Southern California entertainment industry for decades, also announced payroll cuts as new owners took over.
Paramount on Wednesday began cutting about 1,000 employees, the initial cohort of what could be much deeper cuts. David Ellison, Paramount’s new boss, said the reduction is aimed at “building a strong foundation for the future.”
The layoffs hit not only Paramount’s movie production, but also staff at its CBS television subsidiary, MTV and Comedy Central. The Los Angeles Times reported that another 1,000 jobs are expected to be cut later, bringing the total reduction to about 10% of Paramount’s workforce.
Movie and TV production in Southern California has been declining for years as companies have coped with high costs and been lured to other states or nations with lower costs and subsidies. Another iconic movie company, Warner Bros. Discovery, is currently for sale.
Despite California’s budget woes, Newsom and the Legislature increased state tax credits — in effect, cash subsidies — for in-state TV and movie productions to $750 million this year. But the hemorrhage has continued.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022024-Amazon-Warehouse-REUTERS-SH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-31 08:16:31.620504

Tim Walz’s announcement of a pause in payments for 14 Medicaid programs in Minnesota caused widespread confusion and anxiety among the people who provide services to the elderly and disabled. The Walz administration announced Wednesday that the governor ordered a “pause on all payments for 14 DHS Medicaid services until (an) audit is complete.” […],"Gov. Tim Walz speaks after the end of the special session in June Tuesday, June 10, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz’s announcement of a pause in payments for 14 Medicaid programs in Minnesota caused widespread confusion and anxiety among the people who provide services to the elderly and disabled.
The Walz administration announced Wednesday that the governor ordered a “pause on all payments for 14 DHS Medicaid services until (an) audit is complete.”
Providers and Democratic legislators reacted with alarm given the prospect of unpaid caregivers and vulnerable Minnesotans shut out of lifesaving services. DHS clarified that each payment will undergo a review and only be paused — for up to 90 days — “if an anomaly is detected and needs to be reviewed further. If the review determines the bill is fraudulent, it will not be paid.” It’s not clear how long the review will take.
DHS told providers hours after the governor’s announcement via email that “DHS is not holding all submitted claims for these 14 Medicaid services for 90 days.” (In bold.) The snafu comes as Walz seeks to get ahead of the fraudsters who have bilked state and federal programs out of hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years — as well as Republican attacks on the fraud issue, which are already incoming as he begins a race for a third, four-year term.
Rep. Tina Liebling, DFL-Rochester, said lawmakers encouraged the administration to clear up any confusion. “We were very clear with (the administration) that they needed to correct that misinformation” about the payment pause, she said. “I know they didn’t intend that, but it scared a lot of people. A lot of us when we saw that were startled, and providers were too.”
State Rep. Mohamud Noor, DFL-Minneapolis, the top Democrat on the House Human Services Finance and Policy Committee, said that he’s been receiving calls from providers who are concerned their payments will be paused, but he expects payments will be timely: “Most of the claims — any clean claims — should be paid on time,” he said.
A DHS statement to providers on Wednesday stated that there still may be “payment processing delays as we roll out this new prepayment review process,” but the payments pause is not as all-encompassing as providers feared from the press release.
Optum, the third-party auditor contracted by DHS, did not immediately respond to questions regarding the auditing process and how long payments will be delayed for claims that are not flagged. The health care company, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, is familiar with investigations — along with UnitedHealth’s insurance arm, Optum’s pharmacy benefit manager is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice for possibly illegal business practices, according to Bloomberg.
The Association of Residential Resources in Minnesota, which represents disability service providers, said in an earlier release that a pause in all payments could cause people with disabilities to lose their housing and critical services, care workers to go without paychecks and providers to shutter.
Sue Schettle, the CEO of ARRM, said on Thursday that she was previously under the false impression, from Walz’s press release, that the pause would be “sweeping; that all providers that were providing those services would be affected by it.”
Now, after a day of fielding questions from worried providers, Schettle has questions of her own.
“The words that were put in the press release really did cause a lot of confusion, concern and aches for providers,” Schettle said. “What was the intent behind putting it out so poorly?”
Providers also said that they got no heads up about the new review process prior to the public press release.
Had the governor’s office consulted their organization or any other provider, Schettle said, “We would have been able to give them five questions to say, hey, you’re missing this or that.”
The governor’s office defended the language of the press release.
“The press release accurately conveys that all providers will be subject to an audit before payments are made,” said Claire Lancaster, a spokesperson for Walz’s office.
In the meantime, nonprofits that provide critical support for Minnesota’s elderly and disabled residents are worried about the consequences of what they thought was a more sweeping pause in payments.
John Estrem, CEO of Hammer, a nonprofit that provides housing and support services to people with disabilities, said a 90-day pause on payments from the integrated community supports program could impact around $2.2 million in funding. The vast majority of that money goes towards salaries for the workers who help their clients live independently, Estrem said.
But Hammer operates on thin margins, and even smaller disruptions in payments could force the nonprofit to borrow money to cover workers’ paychecks, Estrem said.
Shannon Bock, the executive director of CCRI, another support services nonprofit, also said that it was her understanding that all payments for the 14 programs will be paused for up to 90 days, which would mean “shutting down lines of support for so many people in our state.”
Social service providers are already confronting a hostile budget environment at both the state and federal level. This year, Walz and lawmakers were tasked with making budget cuts to account for a projected deficit in coming years. Walz’s budget proposal suggested cutting payment rates for disability service providers. (The final budget bill passed by lawmakers cuts nursing home funding instead.)
That move also blindsided disability service providers, Estrem said.
“So this seems to be a pattern,” he said. “And it really is hard to do, to run a service organization, when things are coming at you out of the blue.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250609_0562-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 08:16:31.620504
,Utah News Dispatch,2025-10-31 12:00:25+00:00,Utah News Dispatch,Deadline closing in for Utah and 6 other states hammering out a new water plan,Annie Knox,,,,,https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2025/10/31/deadline-closing-in-for-utah-and-6-other-states-hammering-out-a-new-water-plan/,Utah and six other states along the Colorado River are pushing up against a deadline to figure out as a group how to manage the river and its reservoirs.,"The Colorado River is pictured where if flows near Hite, just beyond the upper reaches of Lake Powell, on Friday, Sept. 19, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah and six other states along the Colorado River are pushing up against a deadline to figure out as a group how to manage the river and its reservoirs. 
If they can’t reach an agreement by Nov. 11, the federal government is set to intervene and make its own plan. The existing agreement expires at the end of next year. 
“There’s still hope,” Marc Stilson, principal engineer for the Colorado River Authority of Utah, said Thursday. “They’re working hard, and they’re close.” 
The upstream Upper Basin states — Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming — and the Lower Basin states of Nevada, Arizona and California pitched competing plans to the federal government last year. 
As November deadline nears, Colorado River states ‘nowhere close to an agreement’

Now, in the home stretch of negotiations, the seven states are working through questions including which reservoirs would be managed under the new agreement, how they’ll measure water use and whether the plan will include mandatory cuts to water allocations, Stilson said. 
The Upper Basin states have resisted the idea of mandatory cuts in dry years, saying they typically use much less than their yearly allocation. 
Lower Basin states have said all seven should share water cuts during dry years under the new plan, warning if they don’t, downstream states could face cuts that aren’t feasible for them to absorb, the Nevada Current reported. 
The river provides water to 40 million people across the U.S. and Mexico, and contributes 27 percent of Utah’s water supply. Hotter temperatures tied to climate change have mixed with drought and overuse to reduce its flow. 
Utah isn’t waiting to prepare for potentially significant changes to how it manages water, said Michael Drake, deputy state engineer with the Utah Division of Water rights. 
It’s been investing in expanding its use of tools to better measure and monitor water use since 2023, Drake told reporters Thursday. 
That year, the Legislature poured $1 million into a Colorado River measurement infrastructure project and approved $650,000 in annual funding to monitor water use, according to the division. 
Whether the state ends up facing cuts as part of the new plan or just working toward new targets, Drake said, it sees a need “to be able to manage water better, and you can’t regulate what you can’t measure.”
“As we get close here, I think reality is starting to hit and so we want to put out the messaging, you know, we can do this,” Drake told Utah News Dispatch. 
He noted the possibility of forced cuts is troubling to many of the state’s farmers. 
“What we’re going to be asking people to do is to see water running in a stream, and to not take it, to leave it there,” Drake said. “It’s a hard pill to swallow.”
Scott Thayn, who farms alfalfa and the grain sorghum in unincorporated Carbon County, agreed.
“If something happens with this new treaty and they drop it 10, 15, 20%,” Thayn said, “most of the years we’re going to be hurting.”

By contrast, food banks have to get food into their warehouses, then back out their doors to distribution spots where the food is given out. (Photo: Aramelle Wheeler/Food Bank of Northern.)Food banks are vowing to do everything they can to keep people fed as federally funded “food stamps” are withheld from the 1 in 6 Nevadans approved for them. But they warned state lawmakers Thursday they will not be able to fill the gap of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP.
Lawmakers this week approved nearly $40 million in assistance to local food banks, which are expected to see a 25% surge in demand because the Trump administration has declared it will not issue November SNAP benefits while the federal government shutdown continues.
Beth Martino, the president and CEO of Three Square in Southern Nevada, told state lawmakers on the Interim Finance Committee that the food banks will be moving “as quickly as possible” to get food into the community. But she offered a sober warning.
“This is not enough to meet the need, and there’s probably no way that philanthropy can fill this gap,” she said. “The answer is to reopen the government and run these programs as intended.”
SNAP is “highly efficient,” Martino said. It loads benefits onto electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards that individuals and families can use on their own schedules.
By contrast, food banks have to get food into their warehouses, then back out their doors to distribution spots where they are given out.
“That takes time,” Martino said. “It’s not as efficient, and that’s one of the challenges that we’ll face. I would expect that this investment today will take us 10 to 12 weeks to move back into the community, at minimum.”
Even if lawmakers were to give $90 million to the food banks overnight, it would be a logistical challenge, said Martino. 
“No dollar amount would allow us to be out in the next two weeks serving 90 million pounds of food to Nevadans,” she said.
Seniors and families, who make up the majority of SNAP recipients, would find themselves waiting for hours in a car line to get a box of food.
“We always try to serve people with dignity,” she added.
Demand already on the rise
Three Square has already recorded a 16% increase in the number of people coming into its food pantries, according to Martino. That increase does not include the month of October.
“But I can tell you anecdotally that we have certainly seen an increase above and beyond that,” she said.
Three Square has done special distribution sides for federal workers who’ve been impacted by the federal government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and is now on day 31.
“And we’ve been contacted by several of our partners to say that they needed more food, that they were actually running out of food at distributions because we were sending at the levels we had been over the last four months and that was not adequate to meet the needs that had been coming in,” said Martino.
Three Square estimates that 25% to 35% of the SNAP recipients who don’t receive their approved benefits next week will seek out a food pantry.
“We would need to almost double our distribution in order to meet that need,” said Martino.
Shane Piccinini of the Food Bank of Northern Nevada told lawmakers their pantries have not seen a significant increase since July.
“However, I do want to put on the record that we have been serving 160,000 people a month in that period,” he said. “So, the need has not been low.”
Pre-pandemic the food bank’s visitation hovered around 98,000, he added.
Piccinini said the Food Bank of Northern Nevada anticipates a 25% increase in November. That equates to an additional 40,000 people.
In preparation, the food banks have already started purchasing foods, with a focus on nonperishable items because nobody knows how long the shutdown will continue. Families may need to be able to stretch what they get as long as they can.
Typically, perishable items like proteins, fruits, vegetables and dairy items make up 60% of what Three Square distributes, according to Martino.
Nevada National Guard to assist
As part of the state’s “food insecurity plan” to bolster the food banks, Gov. Joe Lombardo committed to deploying the Nevada National Guard to assist at food banks.
Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno said situations like this are “exactly what the National Guard is designed to do” but she worries the weaponization of the guard by the Trump administration might result in some people not feeling safe standing in a food pantry line.
Nicole Lamboley, president and CEO of the Food Bank of  Northern Nevada, said they plan to use the National Guard for warehouse and logistics operations, rather than having them hand out food to people. For distribution, they plan to use community volunteers.
Lamboley and Martino said the community has stepped up to volunteer. Lamboley said that after the food bank put out a call for volunteers they “were at wait-list level” within 24 hours.
Martino added that some business owners have called and offered up all of their employees for volunteering.
Still, both food banks welcomed additional members of the public to sign up as volunteers.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PXL_20250305_172257574.PORTRAIT-large-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-10-31 08:56:45.877924

As election day approaches, nonprofits, political parties and a billionaire have spent nearly $26 million on ads and other communications in an effort to convince voters to support or oppose Prop. 50 – the most of any ballot measure in recent state history.


Voters in Sacramento got a mailer in recent weeks declaring that “California’s landmark election reform — under attack by Sacramento politicians.” Orinda residents have received flyers that shout “Fight back against Trump — Vote Yes.” The narrator on a video ad shared on X intones, “Two wrongs don’t make a right — Vote No.” These are among a barrage of advertisements, yard signs and billboards bombarding Californians with direction to support or oppose redrawing the state’s congressional districts four years ahead of schedule.
But none of it was paid for by the major campaigns advocating for and against Proposition 50, the ballot measure put forth by Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter Republican redistricting efforts in Texas. Instead, nonprofits, political parties and a billionaire have financed an independent effort as election day approaches Tuesday.
Groups not directly affiliated with any Prop. 50 campaign have reported spending nearly $26 million to influence voters as of October 30, more than any ballot measure in California history, according to a CalMatters analysis of secretary of state campaign finance data. The spending does not include the $118 million reportedly spent by the three major campaign committees.

Anybody can buy ads, pay canvassers, or otherwise promote their position on a California ballot measure as long as they register a state committee, disclose major funders in the ads themselves and don’t coordinate with the primary campaigns. Once they’ve spent at least $1,000, they must report their spending to the secretary of state as independent expenditures.
Independent spending for the redistricting measure is significantly more than the previous record-setting Prop. 32 in 2012, which drew $10.8 million in similar spending and would have restricted campaign contributions from labor unions if it passed.
The largest spenders outside of the major campaigns this time are billionaire Democrat Tom Steyer, who reported more than $12.8 million in expenditures and the California Republican Party, which poured more than $10.2 million into ads and messaging opposing the measure. As a result, Steyer and the state GOP have become the second- and third-largest independent ad buyers in state history. The only group to have spent more was run by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s “California Dream Team,” which reported spending a combined $27.8 million on multiple ballot measures in 2004 and 2005.
In yet another example of how the campaign has drawn national attention, Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, gave $8 million to the state GOP in October, which they used to buy nearly $2.9 million worth of digital ads two weeks ago; the super PAC also gave $5 million directly to one of the major campaigns against Prop. 50 — “Stop the Sacramento Power Grab.” 
Some large nonprofit organizations are spending money on Prop. 50, too. The largest expenditures come from the California Community Foundation, which reported spending $800,000 to support the proposition, although that doesn’t capture all of the money the nonprofit is putting into the election.
Miguel Santana, president and CEO, said that the foundation is additionally spending more than a million dollars to convince voters to participate in the election without telling them specifically how to vote, though efforts to increase turnout without taking a position are not reported to the secretary of state.
“California representation at the federal level matters,” Santana said. “Our power is being diluted by the gerrymandering that is taking place in other parts of the country.”
Not just Democrats and Republicans
Other political parties and groups in the state have also reported independent expenditures for Prop. 50. The left-leaning California Working Families Party reported spending more than $36,500 on digital ads and outreach to reach voters who might be less receptive to Newsom as a messenger.
“This isn’t the fight we wanted, but I think it’s important that California, the most populous state in the country, fights back,” said Jane Kim, California Director of the Working Families Party. “We really want to hit younger voters who are less party loyalists.”
The Libertarian Party of California spent more than $6,400 for postcard mailers opposing the proposition. Loren Dean, chairman of the state party, said the outreach was an opportunity to raise the party’s profile. “It is important to us to take every opportunity to remind people that the ‘two-party’ choice is a fiction built by would-be monopolists who yearn for authority over their neighbors,” Dean said. “Third-party voices matter.”
Though not a registered political party, the California Democratic Socialists of America reported spending more than $3,500 to try to persuade voters to vote yes while maintaining distance from Gov. Newsom.
“We are not doing this to support him,” said William Prince, co-chair of the organization. “We must ally with him in the struggle against fascism.”
Similarly to the Libertarian Party, the DSA also sees value in putting out campaign materials stamped with “Democratic Socialists of America.” 
“When voters think about who encouraged them to vote against a permanent MAGA majority in Congress, more are going to think of [California] DSA than they would have if we sat this out,” Prince said.
Elected officials and local parties hit their districts
More than two dozen county parties, along with current and former elected officials, have reported more than $1 million in independent expenditures for and against Prop. 50.
The Sonoma County Democratic Party reported spending nearly $90,000 on postcards, phonebanking and radio ads to support the initiative, while the Yuba County Republican Party reported almost $55,000 to spread opposition signs around Northern California.
Pat Sebo, chairperson of the Sonoma County Democratic Party, said the county party spent money on its own mailers and canvassing because it wanted to move faster than its state counterpart. “We wanted to act, we had volunteers, we had them basically beating down the doors at headquarters here,” she said. 
“Ballot measure campaigns usually do not distribute signs to local Republican groups,” said Johanna Lassaga, chair of the Yuba County Republican Party. She credited her group’s expenditures for raising visibility of the party’s unified position: “If you drive through the North State, you will see [our signs] everywhere.”
Along with a $5,000 contribution to the main Yes campaign, former Democratic state Sen. Steve Glazer from Orinda used his ballot measure committee to spend more than $160,000 in support of Prop. 50, because he said he could reach voters in his district in a way a statewide campaign could not.
“When you’re running a statewide campaign, you don’t always have that luxury of microtargeting,”  Glazer said. “I felt that I had a good handle on the pulse of the voters in my area, where I believe I have a heightened level of credibility.”
“We decided we want to do it quicker, better, faster,” said Assemblymember Juan Alanis, Republican from Modesto, whose ballot measure committee reported spending more than $12,500 on signs to oppose Prop. 50. He said the short election cycle meant the statewide campaigns could not ensure enough signs would reach his district in time, so he decided to “make sure my area is taken care of.”
Assemblymember Maggy Krell, a Democrat who represents Sacramento, said that the most valuable way she could have spent $8,000 was to organize door-knocking in her district. “My best contribution to the campaign is my network of volunteers — people who are going door-to-door and engaging voters one conversation at a time,” she wrote in an email.
Republican Assemblymember Carl DeMaio from San Diego spent more than $430,000 from his Reform California committee, because he didn’t think the official No campaign was up to the task. He released a final ad last week that urged voters statewide to reject Prop. 50.
“I don’t trust the failed consultants of these mega-committees,” he said. “My intuition was correct. The ads were horseshit, off-message.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/103025-PROP-50-IE-MONEY-GH-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-31 08:16:31.620504

The Alabama State Board of Education is scheduled to vote on new textbooks at its meeting next month (Todd Van Emst for Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Board of Education will vote on adopting new social studies and arts education textbooks for the 2026-2027 school year at its November meeting.
Members of the Alabama State Board of Education earlier this month were given scores granted to textbooks by the Alabama State Textbook Committee.
The two committees, one for social studies and one for arts education, were appointed in April to review and rate textbooks. Once the ratings were complete, they were sealed and given to State Board of Education members.
The scores and number of textbooks evaluated were not shared with the public. Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey told the board the textbook approval process in Alabama is a “tight-lipped” process due to contracts with publishers.
“Until the board votes and says, ‘This is the list we are sending to the governor to sign contracts with,’ then they can’t be public,” he said to board members.
The board will vote on the textbooks at its Nov. 13 meeting.
Mackey also told the board the textbook approval process is the only one that carries criminal charges if done incorrectly.
“Remember that for textbook companies, these are multi-million dollar contracts, and if they get pushed out of a contract, and they think it’s because board members or the superintendent didn’t follow the law, they would, in a heartbeat, bring charges against us,” he said.
ALSDE only facilitates the textbook approval process. The textbook committee reports directly to the Board of Education members.
Mackey reminded board members that previously, Alabama textbook law stated that recommendations from the committee couldn’t be made public until the governor signed contracts with publishers.
“You all went to the Legislature and got that changed, because that’s an extra couple of months, and now the law is as soon as the board votes on them, they’re public so that’s been speeding things up by about three months,” he said.
Members of the public may review the social studies and arts textbooks that are under consideration until Nov. 12 at select libraries. 
Alabama social studies standards were updated last December. A report from Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education thinktank, was mostly positive but critiqued the teaching of slavery, “state’s rights,” and lack of post-1970s history.
The updated curriculum includes three years of world history and geography and three years of Alabama in American history and government. It also requires schools to teach the Holocaust and shifts teachings of the Civil Rights Movement to the fifth grade to build on context and expand on the role Alabama played in the movement.
In 2021, board members approved the Preservation of Intellectual Freedom and Non-Discrimination in Alabama Public Schools. The resolution prohibits “concepts that impute fault, blame, a tendency to oppress others, or the need to feel guilt or anguish to persons solely because of their race or sex.” The move was aimed at critical race theory, an academic framework that seeks to understand the persistence of racism in the United States after the civil rights movement. Teachers and officials repeatedly stressed that critical race theory is not taught in K-12 schools. 
The textbook selection process ties into the new curriculum that has yet to be implemented. While the state can set the course of study, companies don’t always create textbooks with each state’s standards in mind.
According to American Public Media, California and Texas have the most influence in the K-12 textbook industry with Florida beginning to have influence as well.
The last time Alabama updated social studies textbooks was 2013. EdReports, a non-profit organization that reviews instructional materials, said in a statement Oct. 23 that new textbooks and other instructional materials are needed for students.
“We believe that students are best served by high-quality instructional materials (HQIM) that reflect the most current research on how kids learn and what they need to succeed in school and beyond. These materials help support educators with clear instructional pathways and strong guidance, especially when paired with thoughtful local adoption processes and professional learning,” the organization said.
Local school boards get the final say in what books are adopted for their schools and can even consider textbooks that are not recommended by ALSDE.
“So long as the state board of education doesn’t reject it. If you reject a textbook, then they cannot use state funds to buy the textbook. But if it’s a textbook that they just didn’t submit to the committee, and they want to go sell to a local county, they can still do that,” Mackey told board members.
This will be the last textbook adoption for a core class until math in 2029.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15-txtbook-tve-15-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-10-31 08:16:31.620504
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-31 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,SNAP suspension a reminder to CT GOP: Trump sets the agenda,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/31/ct-gop-trump-sets-the-agenda/,Criticizing Trump is unthinkable in a GOP primary for governor. But standing with him on some issues can carry risks in a general election.,"A demand by state Senate Democrats that Republicans challenge President Donald J. Trump over the suspension of the SNAP food assistance program is a harbinger of the challenges Trump could pose for Republican candidates next year in blue states like Connecticut.
His administration’s plan to cut off SNAP on Saturday and deny food aid to 42 million Americans is a step Trump did not take during the longer federal government shutdown during his first term, buttressing a Democratic claim that the suspension is a tactic, not a fiscal necessity.
“This crisis is being precipitated needlessly in order to inflict more suffering on people,” Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said Wednesday, flanked by a half-dozen other Democratic senators. 
Are elected Republicans in Connecticut supporting the move? Looney asked. His immediate goal was to cause discomfort for Republican state senators, who dismissed the press conference as a stunt. 
It will be harder for Republican candidates for governor to be similarly dismissive once the 2026 campaign is fully underway.
Polling points to two factors problematic for blue-state Republicans: Given his popularity among Republican voters, criticizing Trump is unthinkable for any Republican planning on competing in a GOP primary. But standing with him on a growing list of controversial positions carries risk in a general election.
An Economist/YouGov Poll released Wednesday showed Trump hitting a new low: 39% approve and 58% disapprove, a net negative rating of 19 points. The same poll, however, showed 86% of Republicans still backing him.
Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat on the verge of announcing his candidacy for a third term in 2026, notes the aversion of his two would-be Republican challengers, Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and Mayor Erin Stewart of New Britain, to differences with Trump. 
Do they agree with the suspension of SNAP and other aid programs during the budget impasse in Washington, which sparked a partial federal shutdown that begins its second month Saturday? Are they in agreement with the president? Those are questions Lamont says Fazio and Stewart won’t answer now, even though they are unavoidable for a sitting governor.
“I know these guys are going to embrace Trump like there’s no tomorrow, right up until somebody wins the primary. Then they’re going to show their feisty independent streak,” Lamont said, smiling. “Don’t be fooled.”
Stewart opened an exploratory campaign in January, a step that allowed her to begin raising money. She is not seeking reelection as mayor and will leave office on Nov. 11, a week after the municipal election. A gubernatorial campaign announcement is expected soon after. 
Ryan declared his candidacy for governor two months ago. 
Fazio and Stewart previously had kept a respectful distance from Trump. Until recently, Fazio had declined to say if he had voted for Trump in any of his three runs for president. In 2018, Stewart accepted an invitation to visit Trump but stressed her independence of the MAGA movement.
“I have no ties to them, and I’ve been pretty outspoken about not supporting Trump and about not supporting or being in favor of a lot of what he’s done and his approach,” Stewart said then. “If I was out there wearing ‘Go Trump’ stuff, I’m sure that they would be using that against me. But I haven’t been. I never have been.”
Both have dropped their reticence, praising the president and sharing that they had, indeed, voted for him. 
Ben Proto, the chair of the Connecticut Republican Party, said leaning one way in a primary then moving to the center is hardly unique to Republicans. He said he expected Lamont, who angered the Democratic left with his veto of an omnibus housing bill intended to promote affordable housing, to be more attentive to liberals on housing until their anger subsides.
“And then once we get past all of this, suddenly he’s going to become Uncle Ned again, and back in the middle, right? That’s what he’s going to do. Why? Because the vast majority of Connecticut lives in the middle,” Proto said. “And so, yeah, he’s going to do the same thing, just on his side of the aisle.”
One difference is that Lamont, to a large degree, can choose the issues where he takes on liberals in his party. Fazio and Stewart have no say over what issues Trump will put over every front page, newscast and social media feed.
Trump has leaned into controversy since the opening hours of his new term, pardoning the Jan. 6 rioters, declaring an end to birthright citizenship, barring leasing for new offshore wind projects, suspending refugee resettlement and curtailing federal funding for humanitarian aid and medical and scientific research.
In late August, the administration ordered a stop-work order on the nearly completed Revolution Wind, an offshore wind project largely staged from the State Pier in New London. It was expected to provide carbon-free power the New England electric grid, supported by power-purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island.
Connecticut, among others, sued, and a federal judge lifted the stop-work order. The episode was a stark example of the potential for conflict between a Connecticut governor and the president.
One prominent Republican, House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, spoke against the order and the administration’s failure to offer a clear rationale for the action or a path to go forward. Fazio, the ranking Republican on the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee, did not.
“If I was running to be a member of Congress or the U.S. Senate, then I should be answering for every single issue that is a federal issue,” Fazio said. 
He sidestepped saying whether he agreed with the Trump administration’s suspension of SNAP.
“My opinion is our U.S. senators should be voting for legislation to fund SNAP,” Fazio said.
Democratic senators have refused to vote for the continuing resolution to fund government operations unless Republicans agree to preserve at least some of the subsidies created during the COVID pandemic to bring down the cost of health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
Stewart did not respond to a request for comment.
Candelora, who has endorsed Fazio, said he well understands the reluctance to go down the “rabbit hole of trying to score political points on every issue coming out of Washington.” But he believes some of those issues must be addressed by elected officials and candidates in Connecticut.
“I think in the end, people in Connecticut are starving for leadership. I don’t let a sitting president define my principles and who I am as a leader. Any candidate should lead on their own and let the chips fall where they may,” Candelora said.
He added a postscript:

Wes Moore declared a state of emergency Thursday to send $10 million to food banks, responding to the Trump administration's announcement that funds for SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, will run out in November.","Gov. Wes Moore spent a few minutes sorting donated food at the Anne Arundel County Food Bank before signing an executive order Thursday declaring a state of emergency to allow for distribution of food aid. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) declared a state of emergency Thursday to send $10 million to food banks, responding to the Trump administration’s “human-made” crisis when it said funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will run out in November.
“I understand the weight of what it means to put this state under a state of emergency – when the state of emergency is not a natural disaster, when it is a human-made one,” Moore said Thursday at the Anne Arundel County Food Bank. “What’s really unfortunate — is that these are actions that the state of Maryland is taking because the actions that the federal government is taking are actively hurting our people.”
More than 680,000 low-income Marylanders are set to lose their November benefits from the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Moore signed an executive order Thursday declaring the state of emergency and directing $10 million in state funds toward meal assistance programs to alleviate the expected surge when SNAP benefits are denied.
Moore said the state must “move quickly to make sure we’re getting the most support to those most in need” and that the $10 million in additional state funds will go out to “hundreds of institutions with experience of distributing food at the regional level.

“We are also providing support to local nonprofits, faith-based organizations, food kitchens, farmers markets, school pantries and also mobile food units,” he said.
While some lawmakers appreciate the help for meal assistance programs across the state, many note that the $10 million won’t even cover 10% of the $123.2 million state SNAP recipients receive in a typical month.
The $10 million comes from an account funded by capital gains taxes called the Fiscal Responsibility fund. The highly volatile revenue source is difficult to project year to year, but senior administration officials say the fiscal 2025 closeout for those funds was “better than expected” and that about $200 million is sitting in the account.
State fiscal experts treat the revenue like found money, placing it in a separate account to be used for one-time expenses — specifically K-12 and higher education capital projects. Moore’s declaration of a state of emergency allows him to repurpose the money.
Senior administration officials said that they will have more details about how the money will be distributed in the next few days. Meanwhile, more than 371,522 Maryland households are set to lose SNAP benefits for the month of November.
After funding benefits when the government was shut down in October, the Trump administration reversed course last week and announced that it is unable to continue funding SNAP next month, even though critics note there is $6 billion in a U.S. Department of Agriculture account specifically for that purpose. But the White House said it is not allowed to touch that money during a government shutdown/
Unless Congress agrees on a budget, SNAP funding would be halted, the administration said — and it may not reimburse states that decide to fill the gap in the meantime.
The federal funds are set to run out on Saturday, though everyone’s benefit renewal date is different and in Maryland, the first date for which recipients will not have their SNAP benefits renewed for November is Tuesday, Nov. 4. On Tuesday, and every day thereafter, more and more people will find that their EBT cards did not get refilled for the month

More than two dozen states, including Maryland, this week sued the Trump administration in hopes of forcing the government to pay for SNAP amid the shutdown.  In the meantime, a handful of governors in other states have signaled they will use state funds to cover SNAP regardless.
Many state lawmakers called on Moore Wednesday to tap the state’s Rainy Day fund to directly backfill missing SNAP benefits, which could have used up upwards of $123.2 million from the state’s designated emergency dollars just for November. Using money from the Fiscal Responsibility fund leaves the state’s Rainy Day funds untouched for now.
Moore’s approach to mend the SNAP benefit cut-off is getting mixed reviews from lawmakers.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey (R-Upper Shore) thinks Moore should fund SNAP benefits directly, saying that the governor has “once again passed on the opportunity to lead.”
“Other governors found a way to do this the right way — directly and transparently,” Hershey said in a statement Thursday. “Governor Moore chose the harder, less effective path, handing responsibility off to nonprofits despite his administration’s poor track record of accountability in that space. Marylanders deserved better than confusion and headlines.”
Comptroller Brooke Lierman also supported state action to extend SNAP benefits, in November touting the economic benefits of letting people purchase their groceries within their communities through SNAP funds.
Del. Emily Shetty (D-Montgomery), who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees social services, said that $10 million toward food banks is a “good start.”
“$10 million is not a small amount of money,” Shetty said. “It will enable food banks to purchase additional food for distribution efforts. The lines for food banks are already around the blocks.”
However, if the legal challenge to force the Trump administration to release funds for SNAP does not go in Maryland’s favor, Shetty said the next step “has to be an extension of SNAP benefits” by the state.
“Let’s not forget that the total amount of SNAP benefits that are no longer going to be on cards is about $130 million,” Shetty said. “So this is less than 10% of the money that people would otherwise be receiving to purchase food for their families.

“We can look at it week by week as needed, but as we get further into the holidays and families go deeper into their savings,” she said, “this becomes a more urgent, pressing matter.”
But Moore says that he has “no belief that the federal government is going to reimburse anybody for anything,” and with more than three years left in the Trump administration, be believes it is safer for Maryland’s fiscal outlook to be cautious about dipping into the Rainy Day fund.
“Not only are we going to make sure that we’re protecting and taking care of our people, but also that we’re going to ensure that there is a real measure of fiscal discipline when it comes to how Maryland is going to manage its finances,” he said.
Meanwhile, food banks report increased activity and need in the last few weeks.
Maryland Food Bank CEO Meg Kimmel told reporters Wednesday, prior to Moore’s executive order, that “the need in Maryland has been high for some time” and will likely increase as SNAP benefits come to an end.
“Nationwide, SNAP provides nine meals for every one meal provided by the charitable food system,” Kimmel said Wednesday. “We’re already beginning to see the influx of federal furloughed workers on top of historically high levels of food insecurity that came out of the (COVID-19) pandemic, and those levels never went down.
“The SNAP stoppage will have an immediate impact on even more Marylanders, and we can already see this happening,” she said. “We’ve never been in a situation where a lot of our SNAP benefits have been off the table. So of course, we’re very concerned.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_4177-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 07:56:45.602853

A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit seeking public access to recordings of all Oakland County judicial hearings. | ScreenshotA federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, which had sought to make the audio and video recordings of Oakland County court proceedings available to the public.
The lawsuit, Hallman v. Reeds, was filed in April in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and was seen by the plaintiffs as a way to hold judges accountable when they are accused of courtroom errors or misconduct. 
However, in an order issued Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Brandy McMillion granted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, finding that there was no constitutional right to access, copy or disseminate court recordings under the First Amendment.
The motion to dismiss had been filed by the named defendants in the case; Oakland District Court judges Travis Reeds and Lisa Asadoorian, as well as Oakland Chief Circuit Judge Jeffery Matis. 
The lead plaintiff, Dr. Samantha Hallman, filed the lawsuit after being denied access to recordings of Asadoorian’s courtroom, whom she alleged had subjected her brother to abusive conduct during a probation violation hearing.
Hallman was later allowed to view a recording of the proceeding involving her brother, but was denied permission to disseminate a copy to the public, legislators and other policy makers.
While transcripts of hearings are made available to the public, recordings are not and attorneys with the ACLU of Michigan claimed that transcripts were inadequate compared to an audio or video recording in capturing the tone, tenor and demeanor of a given judge, especially when an attorney or a party is seeking to highlight a judicial error upon appeal.
But in Tuesday’s order, Judge McMillion found that Hallman had failed to state a plausible claim for relief and dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning that it cannot be refiled. 
However, the ruling itself can be appealed. A request to the ACLU Michigan to ask if they planned an appeal has yet to be answered.

Kevin made sure my time always aligned with the people of Vermont.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Patrick J. Leahy: Remembering Kevin McDonald.","Patrick J. Leahy represented Vermont in the United States Senate for 48 years – from 1975 to 2023. He also was president pro tempore of the United States Senate from 2012 to 2015 and from 2021 to 2023. 


When I think of Kevin McDonald, who died quite suddenly in September, I think of family, integrity and excellence. But it wasn’t always quiet excellence. Sometimes — often in fact — it was noisy excellence — because Kevin was someone who was full of life, laughter and energy.
For more than three decades in my Senate office, Kevin was at the center of just about everything we did. He worked his heart out every single day but also made sure that every day had joy and purpose in it.
Kevin served as my longtime scheduler and senior aide in the United States Senate. He arrived from another Senate office with glowing recommendations and, within weeks, became indispensable.
He understood that a public official’s schedule isn’t just a list of meetings — it’s a reflection of priorities and values. Kevin made sure my time always aligned with the people of Vermont. He kept the trains running in an operation that stretched from Capitol Hill to every corner of our state, and he did it with patience, warmth and grace.
But he also did it with laughter. Kevin had an unmatched sense of humor — quick, mischievous, joyful and Irish to the core. He could find humor in almost anything, and he made others laugh constantly. He wrote every holiday skit for my office for more than 30 years, dreamed up the goofiest costumes and made sure everyone participated.
Kevin had a gift for understanding people — their stories, worries and joys. I can’t count how many Vermonters told me that Kevin remembered important details about their lives: a son or daughter applying to college; a parent recovering from surgery; or a farmer struggling through a hard season. His empathy was genuine and boundless. People who sat down with Kevin often found themselves opening up about their lives and challenges, and they left feeling seen and understood.
Inside the office, Kevin was our compass. Staff came to him before they came to me, knowing he would listen, think things through and offer practical wisdom. He didn’t say, “You can’t do that.” He’d ask, “Have you thought about doing it this way?” His calm steadiness and quick wit grounded us all. In a place full of large personalities and sharp elbows, Kevin led with humility, humor and heart.
He was deeply loyal — the most loyal person I’ve ever known — and deeply faithful. His religion wasn’t for show; it shaped how he treated people. It kept him humble, grounded and kind.
Kevin was, in every sense, part of our family. Our children adored him. When they learned of his passing, their grief was as deep as ours. To us, Kevin wasn’t staff — he was kin.
Since his passing, Marcelle and I have heard from people across Vermont, the country and abroad — friends, former colleagues, even an ambassador in Ireland — all sharing stories of Kevin’s kindness, humor and humanity. Those messages reminded us how far his influence reached and how many lives he touched, not quietly, but joyfully.
I still catch myself reaching for the phone to call him. After decades together, he could finish my sentences, anticipate what I needed, and, more importantly, remind me what mattered.
Kevin McDonald embodied the best of public service — not ambition or self-promotion, but empathy, loyalty, laughter and heart. Vermont, and all of us who knew him, are better for his life, his friendship and his example.

He is a licensed clinical social worker working at Brattleboro Retreat, a private non-profit psychiatric hospital founded in 1834, where he oversees communications and community partnerships. He lives in Newfane.


As Halloween approaches, the calls start to come in: “Do you think we could have a tour? What about the tunnels? We’d love to do a story for Halloween.” I have to lean back in my chair and take a breath. My colleagues remind me it’s “just a bit of good fun — the boo tour. What’s the harm in it?” But my internal dialogue tells me that this is actually important.  
Persons who sought care — voluntarily or compelled — do not become ghosts when they pass away at any greater statistical frequency than anyone else. Psychiatric hospitals like the Brattleboro Retreat, places that work to help and provide care, do not become “haunted.”
If this is an obvious truth, then we should wonder: why are we so compelled to exotify and “other” those with mental health challenges? Why, driven by a century of “haunted asylum” tropes in movies and media, do we choose this over respecting their basic dignity and memory? 
Mental health symptoms are, after all, quite common, and can come up at many times in life and for many different reasons — not unlike other medical problems.
Thinking of people in my life who are now gone, I remember my mother, the psychologist, who died far too young of pancreatic cancer — a scourge of a disease, then and now. I remember her having psychosis — hallucinations and paranoia — as a reaction to pain medicines and anesthesia when she was in the hospital, confounding nurses as well as friends and family members as she behaved in distinctly different ways than was typical for her.  
Or my uncle, who had been diagnosed at different times in his life with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In his case, the all-too-common problem of poor medical care for persons with mental health challenges nearly took his life. When he was young, his severe Crohn’s disease was dismissed and neglected until my grandmother physically carried his emaciated body into a different hospital to get care.
For so many others, he was “just a person with a mental health problem” not worthy of their time or attention.
There is no eulogy large enough to really capture the scope of his defiance of the stereotypes of these diagnostic labels. Though he always sought care when needed, he refused to let his symptoms define him, and was a loving and passionate advocate for others — at
 one point suing the town of Flint, Michigan because the sewage lines flooded his and his neighbors’ houses, and winning repair costs for all of them! 
My father, too, struggled with a lifelong depression and trauma history that often isolated him, and he survived multiple serious suicide attempts. I choose to remember him as a brilliant labor attorney, who never gave anything less than complete commitment to the causes he took on — even when he would neglect to send a bill afterward! Perhaps he gave the advocacy to others that he couldn’t make use of in his own life. 
They are gone now from this world, and I mourn them as family, but never as psychiatric patients. Their struggles made them more human, not less, and it would bring me joy to imagine that the even as I describe them now, that you, as a reader, take the journey into the shadows of history to find them with me. To find them as they were, in their lives as they lived them, with all the messiness, joy and ordinary tragedy.
I am sometimes haunted by their absence, but I would never want to think that their whole lives could be boiled down to a ghost-status, a “haunting” diminishes their humanity in death.  
And here, the tradition of Halloween fails us, as it doesn’t naturally invite that sort of retrospection and memorialization. Although it is not my cultural tradition, I have always had a respect and admiration for the practices in el Día de los Muertos, including especially the practice of making an ofrenda, a memorial and offering, to remember those who have passed.
What a joy to remember those who are gone, and to sense their spirit and presence being with us — even just for a night each year. For me, it brings an immediate emotional stirring that Halloween has never quite managed to evoke for me.  
At Brattleboro Retreat, we have a small version of this intention in the form of a memorial garden where staff members engrave bricks in honor of those who have impacted them — family, colleagues, teachers, including many who have struggled with mental health challenges. It’s a beautiful place where I can feel the true spirit of those who are no longer with us. 
So this Halloween, please don’t dismiss the humanity of those who sought treatment here, or elsewhere by turning them into ghosts or spectres. They are not wandering our halls, not causing our elevators to malfunction or going bump in the night… at least, not
 any more than in any other place.
The past isn’t a ghost story to be sensationalized; it’s the history of complex, real lives. We honor those who are gone by remembering their full humanity, not by reducing them to specters. The only haunting is the loss of human dignity from stigma and dismissal.

Attar now faces federal extortion and conspiracy charges related to her 2022 re-election effort. (File photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A Maryland state senator, her brother and a Baltimore City Police officer are in federal custody facing federal charges in an alleged blackmail scheme.
The grand jury indictment charging Sen. Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City) and others was unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Baltimore. Prosecutors allege Attar, then a delegate, worried that a disgruntled political consultant would turn against her during her 2022 re-election bid.
The 20-page indictment details how Attar, her brother and a campaign volunteer who was also a Baltimore City Police officer, carried out a scheme to videotape the consultant having an affair, then use the recordings  to threaten the consultant as she sought to arrange the marriages of her children.
It was a conspiracy that included the use of tracking devices on vehicles, video cameras hidden in smoke detectors, and interstate and international communications using the WhatsApp messaging service.
“It was the purpose of the conspiracy that the co-conspirators sought to surreptitiously obtain evidence of the relationship between Victims 1 and 2 so that the evidence could be used to prevent Victim 1 from … engaging in any act or speech that could negatively impact the election campaign or political aspirations of Dalya Attar,” according to court documents.
Attar, a former Baltimore City assistant state’s attorney, was elected to the House of Delegates in 2018 and re-elected in 2022. She was appointed in 2025 to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Jill Carter (D-Baltimore City), who resigned after being appointed to the State Board of Contract Appeals.

With the appointment, Attar became the first Orthodox Jewish woman to serve in the Maryland Senate.
A spokesperson for Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said Thursday that they had just “been made aware of state Senator Dalya Attar’s arrest and we don’t have any additional information to provide at this time.”
“The Senate of Maryland holds its members to the highest ethical standards as we serve our constituents, and we will continue to do so as we learn more about the alleged facts in the indictment,” the Ferguson spokesperson said.
As Attar prepared for her 2022 reelection to the House, she worried about the unnamed female political consultant, with whom she had a falling out after the 2018 campaign, prosecutors said. Attar worried the consultant would try to torpedo her reelection, according to court records. In messages to an unnamed co-conspirator on WhatsApp, Attar worried the consultant “is still looking to screw me badly,” according to the indictment.
“I just want her to be a non-issue in my mind and in reality that won’t happen as long as she is relevant or doesn’t have anything to worry about,” Attar said in a Jan. 9, 2020, message according to the indictment. “Because I believe she’s building things up, even small things, but in the end when it’s the right time for her (close to reelection), it’ll come out … And even more reason why the lady should be afraid to come out with anything at that point.”
A week later, prosecutors said the delegate’s brother, Joseph Attar, and Kalman Finkelstein, a police officer, exchanged messages in which they discussed following the consultant.
The consultant, a U.S. citizen who also lives in Israel, is a friend of Finkelstein’s family. She frequently used a car and apartment owned by the Finkelsteins when she visited Baltimore, the indictment said.
By mid-January, Finkelstein and Joseph Attar, also known as Yossi or Jay, were discussing buying a tracking device that would be placed on the vehicle driven by the consultant. They also discussed, with two other unnamed co-conspirators, recording devices that would be installed in the apartment where the consultant stayed, according to court records.
Joseph Attar and Finkelstein, again using the secure messaging app, allegedly planned when to install video cameras inside smoke alarms in the bedroom and living room areas of the apartment used by the consultant.

In one Jan. 16 message, Finkelstein told two unnamed co-conspirators that the consultant was watching his children until his wife came home. Later that day, Joseph Attar sent a voice message announcing the installation of the cameras.
“Got it connected, tested them and all that. Now I’m on my way there now to go and pick the lock and try to get in,” court records quote Joseph Attar as saying.
It is unclear how long the recording continued. Prosecutors alleged that Dalya Attar sent a series of messages on March 11, 2021, to an unnamed co-conspirator in which she talked about the ongoing effort.
The delegate allegedly wrote that the consultant “needs to be warned before mailers to the Jewish community start coming out about things I voted on in the last three years. We’re nearing my election. We can’t wait until she does it already. Things as simple as anti-police things … She wants her daughters to get married more than she wants to screw with me … There’s the perfect way to scare her re[garding] her daughters shidduchim…Each mailer can do a lot of damage. We have a way that can potentially stop her. Why not at least try.”
A shidduchim is a matchmaking process within the Orthodox Jewish community. Both Attar and the consultant are Orthodox Jews.
By early December, Attar, her brother and Finkelstein were moving their plot forward.
Joseph Attar met with a man described as Victim 2, a married man who was allegedly engaged in the affair with the consultant. The two met at the Atrium at Greenspring Shopping Center in Baltimore.
It was during that meeting that prosecutors allege Joseph Attar told the man of the existence of “hours of footage of you in bed” with the consultant. Attar allegedly told the man that to make “this go away permanently” that he needed to convince the consultant to leave his sister alone.
“Don’t bring her up anymore to anyone. Stay out of this election, the delegate election,” Joseph Attar is alleged to have said. Prosecutors said he then showed the man a video recording of him in bed with the consultant, and warned of the consequences if the man did not do as he was told.

“I’ll share this video with everybody you know, everyone she knows, every Rabbi in town, your kids, your wife, her daughters,” Joseph Attar is alleged to have said. “And every shadchan in Israel who is trying to set up her daughters.”
Later that day, prosecutors said Joseph Attar messaged the consultant saying she should speak to Victim 2.
Five days later, in a message between Victim 2 and Joseph Attar, the man confirmed he spoke to the consultant, who “has indicated multiple times that she is not involved in any activity that could harm Dalia. She has no intention of harming her in anyway either. You have everything you asked for. Put it to bed. Leave me the hell alone.”
Before the end of 2021, Finkelstein and Del. Attar allegedly messaged each other. In that message, prosecutors said Finkelstein urged the delegate to “push [victim 2] one more time.”
Prosecutors said the trio began messaging about the plot again on April 8, 2022.
In an exchange with her brother, Dalya Attar raises concerns about a Facebook post authored by the consultant. The post questioned why some delegates voted against an amendment on a bill before the legislature.
“Looks like she wants the world to know about her and [victim 2],” the delegate allegedly wrote.
She later added that “it’s time to show someone that’ll get back to her,” according to court filings. Attar later allegedly sent a voice message to an unnamed co-conspirator. In it, she allegedly suggested that the co-conspirator should talk to Joseph Attar “about a smart move.”
The plan was to show some of the video to someone who would tell the consultant about it — possibly Finkelstein’s wife.
“I just care about it getting back to [the consultant] and she understands we’re serious. Not another little threat or something like that, she needs to understand we’re serious,” the delegate allegedly said in the voice message.
Prosecutors said Joseph Attar did eventually contact the consultant. In a June 28, 2022, exchange, repeated the threat to send the video to the consultant’s family and the matchmakers. “Do you really want to go down this road?” Attar asked, according to the indictment.
In follow-up messages, Joseph Attar allegedly wrote: “Just leave my family alone and nothing will ever come out” and “put me to the test. I dare you.”
Attar, her brother and Finkelstein face more than a half-dozen charges including conspiracy and extortion. They are also charged with interception and disclosure of wire, oral or electronic communications, and four counts of violating the federal travel act for their use of “a facility of interstate commerce” as part of the alleged extortion plot.
Court records show all three were in federal custody on Thursday. None had lawyers, according to online records.
The charges have potential election implications for Attar, who was appointed to the seat 10 months ago. The district she represents is diverse with sizable Black and Jewish populations.
Attar edged out Del. Malcolm Ruff to replace Carter earlier this year.
Ruff, who was appointed to the house in 2023, announced in August that he would challenge Attar for the Senate seat in 2026.
That race has the attention of Ferguson, the Senate president. He traveled to Attar’s district to spotlight an $800,000 capital project.
The press conference was a first for Ferguson, who had not participated in similar events during his time as Senate president. He later held a similar event for Sen. Shaneka Henson (D-Anne Arundel). Both women were appointed to their seats and are expected to face challengers in 2026.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0312-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 07:56:45.602853

Brown will lead a team that produces contextualized reporting on a range of topics ranging from school funding and postsecondary opportunities to curriculum and mental health in schools. The stories will be anchored in community-centered reporting with an eye toward racial justice and equity. 
She is looking forward to using her expertise to guide and shape coverage of one of the state’s most consequential topics. 
“Jackson is my hometown. As someone born and raised in the city and metro area, I was proud to serve my community years ago as a daily newspaper reporter,” Brown said. “Since then, I’ve relied on Mississippi Today for in-depth journalism that holds state and local officials accountable and uncovers issues important to Mississippians’ everyday lives. It’s an honor to join that team and serve my hometown and state again as a journalist.”
As a former education reporter and a graduate of Murrah High School and the University of Mississippi, Brown is intimately familiar with the successes and challenges of the state’s education system. She also has a keen awareness of how those issues fit into a national context. 
She has worked with national education groups such as the Education Writers Association and, most recently, on a contract with the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics. She also spent more than a decade as a reporter at newspapers in Mississippi, Virginia and North Carolina and received her master’s degree in interactive media from Elon University.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Republican gubernatorial hopeful Jack Ciattarelli has said he wants to remake New Jersey’s high court, moving away from a tradition of partisan balance that has persisted on the seven-seat bench for nearly 80 years.
Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, has called the court’s partisan balance — an unwritten convention that broadly says no party shall have more than four of the high court’s seven seats — a “failed tradition” and pledged to nominate conservative justices.

“I will appoint Supreme Court justices that agree with me on issues like high-density housing and suburban districts where there’s no infrastructure and who agree with me on school funding,” Ciattarelli said during a debate in early October.
The current state Supreme Court has four Democrats, two Republicans, and one who is unaffiliated but worked in the administration of Republican Gov. Chris Christie.
Ciattarelli’s pledge to do away with the court’s tradition of partisan balance, one that has persisted uninterrupted since the state adopted its 1947 constitution, has some court observers worried that New Jersey’s high court could come to mirror the U.S. Supreme Court.
“We don’t have the situation, alas, that we have down in Washington where there’s such obvious bitter divides that it’s almost getting to the point where the justices apparently are being uncollegial to each other,” said Ron Chen, a former New Jersey public advocate who teaches law at Rutgers Law School.
The U.S. Supreme Court, where conservatives have a 6-3 majority, rarely issues unanimous decisions, and those justices now regularly snipe at each other in dissents and concurrences, questioning not only whether the court has overstepped its authority but also whether justices are consulting law when making their rulings.
Only four of the 38 decisions New Jersey’s Supreme Court has meted out this year included a dissent. All others were ruled unanimously.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who is Ciattarelli’s Democratic opponent in the Nov. 4 election, during a primary debate said she would maintain the court’s partisan balance.
The state high court’s current membership provides Ciattarelli with no grand opportunities to remake the bench. New Jersey’s Supreme Court justices are appointed, with Senate confirmation, to an initial seven-year term and can be renominated and confirmed to remain on the court until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70.
Three justices will turn 70 over the next two gubernatorial terms. Two of them are Republicans.
Only Justice Anne Patterson, a Republican, turns 70 during the next governor’s term, in 2029. The next-oldest member of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner, a Democrat, doesn’t turn 70 until the gubernatorial term after that, in June 2030. 
A victorious Ciattarelli could have other avenues to remake the court, though they’re likely to be substantially more controversial.
Members of the court are typically renominated absent major controversy, but Ciattarelli could gain two seats for Republicans in his first term by moving to replace Democratic justices instead of renominating them, and he could gain a third by the same means if reelected to a second term.
Justices Fabiana Pierre-Louis, Rachel Wainer Apter, and Douglas Fasciale will see their initial seven-year terms expire under the next governor, and Ciattarelli is not required to nominate them for tenure (Fasciale is Republican).
Wainer Apter and Pierre-Louis are Democrats, and nominating Republicans in their place could give Republicans a 5-2 majority on the high court. But that path is perilous.
“We saw 10 years ago what happened when Gov. Christie tried that,” Chen said.
When Christie declined to nominate Justice John Wallace for tenure in 2010, Democrats who controlled the Senate ground his judicial confirmations to a halt, rejecting two of Christie’s Supreme Court nominees and refusing to hear two others. Wallace’s seat was not filled until 2016.
The Legislature could blunt a push to stack the high court with conservatives with little difficulty.
Democrats hold 25 of the state Senate’s 40 seats, and members of the upper chamber are not up for election this year, so the next governor will have a Democratic-controlled Senate for at least two years. If Ciattarelli becomes governor in January, Senate leaders can simply refuse to bring his Supreme Court nominations to committee or indefinitely withhold floor votes on their nominations.
Even if Republicans take control of the upper chamber after legislative elections in 2027, Democratic senators could still block broad swaths of his nominees under an unwritten rule, called senatorial courtesy, that allows senators to unilaterally and indefinitely block nominations from their home county or legislative district.
Sen. Holly Schepisi’s (R-Bergen) invocation of courtesy froze Wainer Apter’s nomination for 18 months.
The pains inflicted by courtesy can stretch past the judiciary. Prior to his retirement, former Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren) for a time blocked all gubernatorial nominations in Warren County.
There’s little indication the Senate would back eliminating courtesy, regardless of who controls the chamber. With few exceptions, the unwritten rule is a senator’s greatest source of individual power.

It is still too crowded to end the freeze.","Sara Vasquez, lead teacher in the classroom with 2- and 3-year-old students at The Learning Bee in Frederick County, reads “The Littlest Pumpkin” Oct. 29. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)At The Learning Bee child care center in Frederick County, groups of preschoolers clustered around a table Wednesday to conduct a science experiment combining vinegar, food coloring and baking soda in a small, black pot with a teacher’s help.
As the ingredients bubbled back out of the pot, the children yelled in unison, “Haaaa!”
“Wasn’t that exciting?” asked lead preschool teacher Carolyn Jackson, as more children clamored to be part of the experiment.
It’s the sort of experience Learning Bee owner Cindi Webb wishes she could share with more children. But enrollment at Learning Bee is currently at about 75% of its 112-student capacity, she said, a victim of the ongoing freeze on state scholarships for children in day care.
“We are down, and we contribute a lot of it to not having the scholarship available for families,” said Webb, who said Wednesday that just 15 of her current 83 students are on scholarship.
But any hopes of the freeze being lifted anytime soon were largely dispelled Thursday, when state analysts presented House lawmakers with the latest data on the scholarship program. It is still too crowded to end the freeze, they were told, and new enrollments have been mostly limited to siblings of children who were already getting a scholarship.
Lawmakers in the joint virtual briefing for the House Ways and Means Committee and the Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Education and Economic Development did not offer specific solutions, but pledged to push the issue in the 2026 General Assembly session.

The scholarship program has largely been a victim of its own success. When it began in 2018 as the Maryland Child Care Subsidy, enrollment stood at more than 12,000 children, according to data presented Thursday. By the last fiscal year, enrollment stood at 46,295, more than the state could afford, which sparked the freeze on enrollment.
When it paused new enrollment in May, the state intended to reopen the program once enrollment dropped to a more manageable 40,000, hopefully by the start of the school year. But the latest figures show about 43,000 children enrolled.
There are enrollment exceptions based on certain income guidelines — such as families receiving temporary cash assistance (TCA) or supplemental security income (SSI) — or having a sibling already enrolled in the program.
Alistair Johnston, a policy analyst who works with Ways and Means, said that since the freeze went into effect, about 1,308 children, or slightly more than 80% of eligible children enrolled, have been siblings. In the meantime, about 2,700 families remain on a waiting list.
Laura Weeldreyer, executive director of Maryland Family Network, who participated in the briefing, thinks the number waiting to get in could be higher.
“I would like you to please consider that those numbers are a gross undercount because many families are walking away and not even applying for the child care scholarship program when they find out there’s a freeze in place,” she said. “It’s tough to accept a job or make plans for your family when you can’t access child care.”
Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard), chair of the Ways and Means Committee, asked Weeldreyer if she knew how many families have walked away and not applied.
“It’s anecdotal,” Weeldreyer said. “We’re hearing through those kind of front line supports and providers.”
While over-enrollment has caused problems, Atterbeary said the popularity of the program is something lawmakers should be proud of.
“It means more parents, especially mothers, have been able to return to the workforce here in Maryland,” Atterbeary said. “It’s an extraordinary achievement and it’s one I’m personally proud of as a legislator, and most importantly, as a mother. Ending the freeze is going to be my priority this upcoming legislative session.”
The nearly 70-minute briefing highlighted some legislation to improve the scholarship program, its popularity and challenges.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Johnston said one of the biggest legislative boosts came from a bill approved in 2022, sponsored by Montgomery County Democratic Dels. Jared Solomon and Julie Palakovich Carr. Part of the law now requires the state Department of Education to cover copayments for families participating in public benefits programs, to exclude child support payments calculated from a family’s income and to allow at least 60 days of benefits for recipients while applications are under review.
‘Right thing to do’
Laura Hyde, a senior policy analyst who works with the Appropriations Committee, summarized a few challenges in the early education profession.
Hyde said the annual minimum wage salary for child care teachers in Maryland is about $31,000; it increases up to $43,000 for lead teachers.
According to 2023 data, she said the average cost of child care in the state for children ages 2 to 4 was $14,850 per year. The annual amount increased to slightly more than $19,000 to care for an infant.
To help boost the profession, the state established a child care career and professional development fund to allow workers interested to obtain a college degree. About $3 million was allocated this fiscal year.
Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick) asked if there’s initial data on how much it would cost to implement universal child care in Maryland.
Johnston said there wasn’t specific data available. However, what was presented is that if the state implemented universal child care for children from birth to two years old, the estimated cost could be $2.6 billion annually.
“That’s a very large number, but working towards that long term goal, it is the right thing to do,” Atterbeary said. “And the progress we’ve made in the last four years shows that this is possible if we stay the course and we continue to work hard.”
In the meantime, some children continue to receive an early childhood education at places like The Learning Bee.
Webb said she wishes state lawmakers would visit her center.
“Come see our day to day,” she said. “Come see how we’re preparing the children and loving and caring for them and meeting their needs.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sara-Vasquez-reading-to-students-10-29-2025-1024x668.jpg,,,2025-10-31 07:56:45.602853

The D.C. region’s economy has taken a hit under President Donald Trump’s administration, following a series of government buyouts and layoffs, and now a near monthlong shutdown. But in Seat Pleasant on Wednesday, it was all smiles in hopes that a much-needed economic boost is on the horizon.
The “Blue Line Corridor” is Prince George’s County’s main economic redevelopment and revitalization project, and the wheels were put into motion before the federal upheaval started impacting the region.
Those involved say that upheaval has made the job harder, but it isn’t putting a stop to the project.
A group of developers, elected leaders, business owners and residents came together Wednesday to celebrate the creation of the Blue Line Corridor Coalition. It’s a group that aims to bring together all the stakeholders focused on revitalizing the area closest to the D.C. line and make sure everyone is pulling in the same direction.
“It’s to coordinate our efforts so that we’re moving more strategically, we don’t waste resources, but we also make sure that everyone’s bought in to what eventually happens,” said Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s).
One of the leaders of the coalition is Bryan Franklin, of Local Initiatives Support Corp., or LISC D.C.

“For outsiders, right? Most people would think about this as a drive-through community,” he said.
“But this community is rich in history, and what this coalition is about is bringing that history to the forefront and bringing the type of change and development that the community has been asking for, and bringing the partners to the table,” he said. “Who can make it happen?”
And he maintained the region is still primed for new opportunities and revitalization.
“We have four Metro stops, and 15% of the land around those Metro stops is vacant lands,” he said. “Where in other parts of our region can you see vacant land, near Metro?
“So as the gateway to D.C., with connections to Amazon headquarters, with connections to Dulles and to DCA [Washington Reagan National Airport], not to mention the Capitol, this central part of the county, the Blue Line corridor, is primed for revitalization,” Franklin said. “We want to make sure that revitalization is community driven.”
One of those joining the coalition is Stabina King, who owns and operates Baked By Bina Mobile Coffee Shop. Her coffee is sold at The Capital Market, an area farmers market also guiding this coalition.
“I see a lot of improvement and changes coming along the way that’s needed,” King said.
She said she can remember when the area thrived, and can’t wait to see it happen again.
“But this time, everybody needs to be included,” King said.
Both Franklin and Lewis said the main redevelopment projects focused on housing are still being built. Ground was recently broken on 200 new units near the Capitol Heights Metro station, and Lewis said another project next to it will be announced soon, among other new development projects in the pipeline.
“All these are being led with minority developers too, so we’re still on pace to transform this area with the type of walkable, transit-oriented development that increases quality life for the residents here,” Lewis said.
“There are things happening. And so even amidst the headwinds, it’s showing that when we come together, we can make change,” Franklin added.

(Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)In the absence of much federal action, states have enacted dozens of laws this year to lower prescription drug costs for their residents — and many more are considering following suit.
States cannot lower drug prices directly, but they can go after different parts of the drug supply chain to try to lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs and reduce excessive spending in state-run health plans.
Nearly two-thirds of the new state laws are aimed at pharmacy benefit managers — the drug middlemen who negotiate deals among the manufacturers that make the drugs, the insurers that allow the drugs to be prescribed, and the pharmacies that sell them.
Several states are considering drug affordability review boards. Others have passed laws to hold manufacturers and PBMs to higher transparency standards.
“So a lot of states went into looking at drug costs — trying to understand and follow the dollar,” said Maureen Hensley-Quinn, a senior program director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that works on health policy issues. “Is it the price that manufacturers are setting? Is it the supply chain where there are different entities?”
Advocates of these laws say it’s up to states to take the lead as the federal government lags in compelling drug companies and insurers to lower prices for patients. But critics say some state interventions could lead to local pharmacies shuttering and may stifle innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, leading to fewer new drugs.
Laws targeting PBMs are wide-ranging in scope, requiring PBMs to pass discounts on to consumers or to be more transparent in their drug purchasing activities. Some states have created drug affordability review boards to assess manufacturers’ prices. Some laws aim to place copay caps on critical medications like insulin.
So far this year, at least 31 states have enacted nearly 70 laws designed to lower drug costs, according to a state drug affordability law tracker from the National Academy for State Health Policy. Earlier this year, Indiana’s legislature passed Senate Enrolled Act 140, which was signed by the governor. The law requires insurers and PBMs to ensure network adequacy and restricts anticompetitive practices — but Medicaid, managed care organizations and the state employee health plan were all exempt due to concerns about cost increases.
Health care pricing bill moves before third reading deadline

“States have no leverage, really, to put pressure on manufacturers to lower their prices, and that’s why I think most of the legislation at the state level has been on the intermediaries, the supply chain,” said Geoffrey Joyce, chair of the Department of Pharmaceutical and Health Economics at the University of Southern California.
Those interventions can go a long way in trying to reduce patients’ expenses, he said.
“The concern [is] about, well, ‘States really can’t lower drug prices, per se,’ but they can,” Joyce said. “I think there’s been evidence.”
California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in October signed legislation to cap the cost of insulin for people covered by state-regulated health plans, including the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, private health plans and its Medicaid program. The state also plans to start offering its own generic version of insulin, costing just $11 a pen, in January.
Colorado’s drug affordability review board capped the cost of a widely used rheumatoid arthritis medication.
And Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore signed a law in May to expand the authority of the state’s drug affordability review board to lower prescription drug prices for all residents, not just state employees.
Pointing fingers
The federal government has taken some steps to lower prescription drug prices. The Inflation Reduction Act under the Biden administration created annual caps on out-of-pocket drug costs and capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for patients with Medicare, the health care program that primarily serves people over 65. The law also gave the federal government more power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare patients.
President Donald Trump has promised to slash drug prices by percentages that some experts say are mathematically impossible. He threatened tariffs on manufacturers that import their drugs if they didn’t lower their prices, which led to a deal with biopharmaceutical company Pfizer. And in May, he signed an executive order designed to ensure the U.S. government can secure drugs at prices on par with other nations.
Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, said in a statement that the Trump administration’s website, TrumpRx, which hasn’t yet launched, will lower drug costs by allowing people to purchase drugs directly from the manufacturer.
But some states are going further.
In October, Colorado became the first state to cap the price of a prescription drug for all consumers. Starting in 2027, new insurers and patients will pay no more than $31,000 a year for Enbrel, a drug that treats rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases — a sharp decrease from the average insurance payment of $53,049 in 2023. Nearly 2,600 Coloradans used Enbrel in 2022, according to state research.
Colorado Democratic state Sen. Julie Gonzales, who sponsored the bill creating the state’s drug oversight board, said states have to deal with a lot of competing interests in the drug supply chain. When it comes to establishing who is setting high drug prices, she said, “everyone is pointing the finger at everyone else.”
It took four years from the law’s passage to set up the board and approve its first payment limit because there were so many special interests involved, she said. “We had to overcome a tremendous amount of angst and fear.”
Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington also have prescription drug affordability boards. New Hampshire created a board but dissolved it in July because of budget cuts.
In California, Newsom signed a bill this year to cap the consumer copay of insulin at $35 per month for all state-regulated health plans, after vetoing similar legislation in 2023. More than two dozen other states had already opted to cap insulin for state health plans. He also signed a PBM regulation bill that, among other provisions, requires pharmacy benefit managers to pass drug discounts on to payers and patients.
California Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener, who sponsored the PBM and insulin bills, said states have the power to lower patients’ out-of-pocket expenses, even if they can’t force manufacturers to lower drug prices.
“The federal government right now is a disaster zone when it comes to health care,” Wiener said. “That’s why it’s more important for the states to step up.”
Other states such as Illinois, Iowa and Louisiana enacted similar PBM laws this year, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy.
A complicated system
The system for developing, selling and distributing prescription drugs is complex.
Pharmaceutical companies determine the initial costs of drugs, but are often accused of setting prices too high. Pharmacy benefit managers say they exist to negotiate lower drug prices, but are often accused of pocketing discounts or engaging in predatory practices. Meanwhile, health insurers pay for the drugs and decide what copays patients may end up with, and are often accused of not reimbursing enough.
Experts note that three pharmacy benefit management companies — CVS Health, Cigna and United Health Group — dominate the PBM industry, which adds to concerns about their market power.
“There’s also some truth to the fact that this industry is very concentrated, and there’s not a lot of transparency around how much money they’re making and how they make their money, and if that’s being shared back with plans and with consumers,” said Pragya Kakani, a health economist specializing in drug policy at the Weill Cornell Medical College.
The pharmaceutical industry typically opposes drug affordability boards.
In Colorado, Amgen Inc., the manufacturer of Enbrel, sued the state in 2024 over its drug affordability review board, alleging that a price cap would cause economic harm to the company. A federal district court dismissed the challenge in March.
“Instead of fixing the root causes of patient affordability concerns, the board has rushed into a reckless experiment,” Reid Porter, senior director of state public affairs for PhRMA, a group that represents pharmaceutical companies, wrote in an email statement in regard to the board’s upper payment limit. “Colorado is risking patient access and jeopardizing the development of new medicines.”
Porter argued that PBMs and health insurers, not drugmakers, drive high costs.
But PBMs say their negotiations lower costs.
“Big Pharma sets the price — and the price is the problem when it comes to Americans facing difficulty affording their prescription drugs,” Mike Baldyga, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents pharmacy benefit managers, wrote in an email statement. “PBMs are the only entity in the drug supply chain that lower prescription drug costs on behalf of patients, and there is no correlation between the rebates they negotiate and list prices.”
Hensley-Quinn, of the National Academy for State Health Policy, noted the challenge of making drugs affordable and accessible.
“There is no silver bullet for lowering drug costs,” Hensley-Quinn said. “You have to balance being able to innovate and making sure that drugs are affordable so that what you have just created, which is life-changing, actually gets to the people that need it.”
But this challenge is in some ways expected and more evidence that states must take action, said Priya Telang, communications manager at the nonprofit advocacy group Colorado Consumer Health Initiative.
“Manufacturers point the finger at PBMs, and PBMs point the finger at insurers. And so it’s really hard to get a sense of who the actual bad players are all at the same time,” she said.
“And so that’s why it’s critical for affordability boards to exist, because they get to see the data, they get to see behind closed doors what the root causes are and really work to bring affordability to consumers.”
Drug affordability boards
When Mary Fowler Simmons, 54, was diagnosed with an advanced cancer three years ago, she had to give up her steady job as a state government worker in Virginia to go through months of expensive and painful treatment. Fowler Simmons survived and is cancer-free today, but is still reeling financially.
Fowler Simmons told Stateline that after being saddled with a hospital bill totaling over $323,000 and depleting her savings, she and her husband continue to pay around $300 a month — after insurance — for prescription medications to maintain her health.










I need them to actually consider what they are doing to the American people and just have affordable prescription drugs available.


– Mary Fowler Simmons, a cancer survivor


Fowler Simmons, who also has Type 2 diabetes, says she wants her state and federal lawmakers to recognize that some Americans are having to choose between paying for their next meal or their necessary prescription drugs.
“They need to have more compassion for people. We’re not in the position that we are making millions, that we can afford this. We’re working-class people,” Fowler Simmons said. “I need them to actually consider what they are doing to the American people and just have affordable prescription drugs available.”
Otto Wachsmann, a Republican in the Virginia House of Delegates and a pharmacist, said that he doesn’t think there’s enough evidence yet that prescription drug affordability review boards work.
He said if states set upper payment limits on drugs, that doesn’t mean a pharmaceutical company would necessarily lower the cost. Rather, he says, pharmacies may just get reimbursed even less than the cost of the drug. This year Virginia lawmakers tried to create a drug affordability review board.
“There’s nothing to prevent the board from saying we’re only going to reimburse $100 for this prescription, although those pharmacies may have to pay $120 for the drug,” Wachsmann said in an interview.
He added that if review boards target expensive and rare drugs for which to set upper payment limits, they could stifle innovation.
“If those manufacturers think that those are the type of drugs that are going to get hit by these boards and they realize they’ll never get their investment back, they’re not going to develop those drugs anymore,” Wachsmann said.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill this year that would have created a drug affordability board in the state, saying in a statement, “This approach could limit access to treatments and hinder medical innovation, especially for life-threatening or rare diseases.”
Wachsmann had voted against the board. Instead, he says it’s better to target PBMs, because he said they are engaging in predatory practices that freeze out small pharmacies and leave consumers with nowhere to go.
Neighboring Maryland created the nation’s first drug affordability board in 2019; it got a boost of resources and revved up activities in 2023.
“It will not hurt pharmacists. It will help everybody except Big Pharma,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of health care advocacy group Maryland Health Care for All, in speaking about the state’s drug affordability review board.
The original bill creating the board only authorized the board to create upper payment limits for drugs purchased by states and local governments in Maryland. But this year, Moore signed a law to expand the authority of the board to create upper payment limits for everyone, except patients on health plans regulated by the federal government.
DeMarco said he’s hoping the board will move to create limits on two popular drugs prescribed for Type 2 diabetes, Jardiance and Farxiga.
“In addition to individuals who can’t afford their drugs, all of us pay the price in higher health insurance premiums, because a big part of our health insurance premiums is high-cost drugs,” DeMarco said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Uncompensated health care at Wisconsin hospitals rose more then 30% in 2024 from the year before, according to a new report from the Wisconsin Hospital Association.
People without health insurance or regular health providers are using emergency rooms more, the report also finds.
The association annually assesses the state of Wisconsin hospitals, including their finances, utilization and staffing. The 2024 report was released Thursday.
“We are seeing a modest improvement in hospital financials across the state,” said Kyle O’Brien, president of the Wisconsin Hospital Association, in an interview. Nevertheless, he added, “there’s a lot of uncertainty in the health care market right now.”
While the state’s hospitals were doing better in 2024 than in the previous two years, 40 hospitals had a negative operating margin, O’Brien said, and many hospitals across the state where margins were positive, but narrow.
Uncompensated care includes charity care — provided by the hospital with the full knowledge that the cost won’t be covered — as well as bad debt: care for which the hospital expected to be paid but wasn’t.
In 2024, uncompensated care in both categories added up to $1.77 billion — a 30.5% increase over the 1.36 billion in uncompensated care in 2023.
O’Brien said several factors are responsible for that increase. One of those is generally higher deductibles on health insurance plans, requiring patients to spend more out of pocket before their insurance coverage kicks in.
“If that patient can’t pay for that higher out-of-pocket [expense], hospitals are the ones that either have to try to collect those dollars, or they are the ones that provide relief through charity care, bad debt policies, or things like that,” O’Brien said.
For hospitals, another top concern is how much Medicaid pays to cover the cost of care.
State budgets over the last decade have been increasing Medicaid hospital payments, O’Brien said, with the 2025-27 budget having the largest increases to date. Even so, he said, hospital Medicaid reimbursements fall short of fully covering the cost of the care that Medicaid is supposed to cover.
Decisions by health insurance to deny coverage are a source of “general consternation” for hospitals, O’Brien said — both with group health insurance policies but also for Medicare Advantage policies. Medicare Advantage policies are sold to people eligible for the federal Medicare program but are instead provided by private insurance companies.
O’Brien said the hospital association is also concerned about projected increases in people without health insurance as a result of higher premiums paid by people who buy their own insurance at the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, created under the Affordable Care Act.
Enhanced subsidies for HealthCare.gov policies enacted in 2021 will expire at the end of this year unless they are renewed. The subsidies are provided in the form of federal income tax credits for consumers who purchase insurance through HealthCare.gov
This week the state Office of the Commissioner of Insurance released projected rates for 2026 that reflected the loss of those enhanced subsidies.
Those higher costs have prompted widespread predictions that, after years in which enrollment in the marketplace plans has set new records, enrollment will drop off and more people with go without health insurance instead.
“We are certainly concerned anytime there’s a potential that somebody might lose coverage,” O’Brien said. Federal law requires hospitals to treat patients whether or not they are able to pay.
“We have been advocating with the congressional delegation to reauthorize those enhanced premium tax credits,” O’Brien said. He said members of Congress have been focused on “issues that are playing out right now [that] may be even bigger than hospital-related issues, but I think that they understand our concerns.”

The poll results, which were released this week, actually are far more in line with not only the state’s past political affiliations, but the attitudes and priorities of Montana’s past.  
In short, we still favor the right of individual privacy – with 83% supporting the Montana Constitutional amendment to ensure a woman’s right to make their own decisions when it comes to reproductive choices.
We still believe in separation of church and state — as reflected in the disapproval of mandatory prayer in schools by 59% compared to 21% who approve. 
We’re still strong supporters of Second Amendment gun rights.  But perhaps in response to the wave of mass shootings nationwide, a whopping 63% of those polled support stricter regulations, weapons limitations, and provisions for owning firearms.  
The most significant indicator of our less than ruby red status is in the approval/disapproval rating of top elected officials from Donald Trump to Congress to Gov. Greg Gianforte. In this regard, none of them came even close to breaking even.
Despite showing 58% of Montanans voted for Trump, his approval and disapproval ratings are tied at a mere 41% – and yes, those are seriously skewed by party affiliation with about 3-out of-4 Republicans approving, but 9-out of-10 Democrats and a whopping 48% of independents disapproving.  Not exactly a great showing for MAGA given its 24-7 domination of the news cycle with endless and often baseless braggadocio.
Still and all, if Trump only gets 41%, he’s slightly ahead of our all-GOP Congressional delegation, which is strange since Montanans are supposedly more supportive of their local politicians.
Guess not, eh?  
Gianforte, having been in office now since 2017 as both our Congressman and now into his second term as governor, “topped” the ratings with a paltry 37% approval.  
Perhaps his approach that Montana is an “easy product to sell” hasn’t exactly proved popular with those who would just as soon keep Montana the way it was and is — and not sell everything to the highest bidder while degrading the vast natural assets and beauty most Montanans cherish. 
Even those minimal approval numbers are far beyond what Montanans give Congress (13% approve, 56% disapprove) and our Congressional delegation. 
At the bottom of the pack sits Congressman Troy Downing with a pitiful 16% approval, 15% disapproval and the vast number of respondents saying they don’t know.  So much for the promised transparency and constituent communication.  
Moving up from there, but not much, sits Rep. Ryan Zinke – in his second term — at 26% approval, only 4% above his disapproval at 22%.
Our senior senator, Steve Daines, doesn’t have much to pound his chest about either.  His 31% approval is exactly three points above his 28% disapproval.  
Then comes Sen. Tim Sheehy who, despite only his first year in office, winds up with 34% disapproval, exactly matching his 34% approval.   
Polls are just polls, but tough to argue we’re “deep red” when Montanans say they overwhelmingly think politics is more polarized, but just aren’t that crazy about the job Republicans are doing.
But here’s the rub: Unless the Democrats and/or independents get their act together and field some electable candidates, we’re likely to keep these low-approval Republicans in office — blundering along, parroting MAGA propaganda, and selling Montana to the highest bidders like just another commodity.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1216006088-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-31 06:56:41.496004

As exhaustive “recalibration” process continues, committee adopts many consultant recommendations but may punt on school nutrition, school resource officers, counselors.
The post Lawmakers advance school funding model that includes teacher raises appeared first on WyoFile .","Beau Fulton, a parent and school board member in Park County, remembers when his Powell school district used to receive dozens of applicants for educational staff positions. 
The pool has diminished in recent years as Wyoming salaries have fallen in comparison to other states, he said.
“Now sometimes it is in the single digits,” Fulton told lawmakers Tuesday. 
It was a recurring theme during the Select Committee on School Finance Recalibration meeting in Casper. 
“The hiring environment in Wyoming right now is absolutely the toughest I’ve ever seen in my career, and that’s 31 years in administration,” Carbon County School District 1 Superintendent Mike Hamel said. 
Two years ago, Sheridan County District 2 Superintendent Scott Stults said, “for the first time this has ever happened in the 27 years I’ve been in Sheridan District 2, we went without a teacher. We had a machining teacher [position] that we could not fill for a full year. That speaks a little bit to the quality and to the quantity of applicants out there.” 
His district, he continued, experienced a 72% decrease in elementary school applicants between 2016-2025. Lagging salaries certainly factor into that, Stults said. “Salaries matter.”
A string of parents, teachers and educators testified before the committee, many urging lawmakers to properly fund education staff salaries — be it veteran instructors, janitors or classroom aides.  
At the end of the two-day meeting, committee members, who are tasked with overseeing Wyoming’s public school funding “recalibration” process, appeared amenable to the salary pleas. Lawmakers directed legislative staff to draft a recalibration bill that would set average weighted teacher salaries at $70,000, a bump from the model’s current weighted average of under $60,000. Other suggestions for a draft include paying substitute teachers more, providing more resources for career and technical education programs and setting a cap on how much superintendents get paid based on district teacher salaries.
However, lawmakers may delay funding decisions for school nutrition programs, school resource officers, mental health counselors and other facets. That’s because committee member Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, asked legislative staff to hold those topics over for further study during the next legislative off-season, or interim. 
“There are certain things that we just need more data on,” Bear said.

The committee’s co-chair, Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, stressed that it’s still relatively early in the exhaustive process of assessing the state’s funding model. 
The draft that comes out of this week’s meetings, Salazar said, “is a beginning.” He expects there will be some tweaking, he said, and promised more public comment opportunities at the committee’s next meeting in January. 
Ultimately, the process will shape what Wyoming’s public school landscape looks like, with significant implications for the state’s students. Lawmakers, many of whom are parents, said it’s not a task they take lightly. 
“This has been a heavy lift,” said co-chair Rep. Scott Heiner, R-Green River. “For many of us, this is one of the most difficult committees we’ve been on.” 
Mandates and court rulings 
The recalibration process is required every five years to ensure the Legislature fulfills its constitutional duty to “provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.” 
To do that, the state’s consultants, Picus, Odden and Associates, have been holding meetings with Wyoming educators, analyzing data and making recommendations over the course of many months.
The consultants presented their preliminary findings to the committee in September. Amid the minutiae and acronym-heavy language of education, several issues emerged as topics of high interest for educators and lawmakers — including teacher retention, school resource officers, school nutrition programs and technology.
Many of those overlap with areas identified in a February district court ruling that found the Wyoming Legislature violated the state’s constitution by underfunding public education and must amend that. The ruling, which the state is appealing, is the latest in a string of court cases that have further delineated the state’s education obligations.

In his 186-page order, Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher found the Legislature failed to properly fund the “basket of quality educational goods and services,” that the Wyoming Supreme Court in 1995 ordered lawmakers to set, update and fund every two years. 
The judge also found the state failed to properly adjust funding for inflation; failed to provide funding for adequate salaries for teachers and staff; and failed to provide sufficient funding for mental health counselors, school safety resource officers, nutritional programs and computers for students. Lawmakers also have failed to properly assess school buildings for “educational suitability,” and have allowed inadequate facilities to exist for too long without repair or replacement, he ruled.
Though much of this week’s meeting was spent on those provisions the judge identified, some lawmakers cast skepticism on the ruling, portraying it as one person’s opinion that won’t necessarily stand. 
The issue of pay  
Consultants brought Dr. Christiana Stoddard, a Montana economics professor, to present a report on Wyoming’s teacher and nonteacher labor markets. 
Stoddard, who has studied the issue in Wyoming for 20 years, noted that “labor markets really matter because they affect the quality of teachers.” The body of research, she continued, shows that “a high-quality teacher makes a big difference in a classroom for the success of the students.”
Wyoming used to rank well above surrounding states for teacher pay, she said, but that’s changed. Utah and Colorado have actually surpassed Wyoming, while other states are closing in. 
Wyoming school districts, she explained, generally pay more than what the state model calls for. The state model’s weighted average for the school year 2024/2025 was a little under $60,000 according to a graph Stoddard presented. Because districts find funds from elsewhere to pad that, the state’s actual average salary that year was a little over $65,000, according to her data. 
Wyoming continues to do very well when it comes to keeping its percentage of very-low-paid teachers small, Stoddard said. What is also small, however, is the percentage of teachers who are very highly paid.

Wyoming teacher pay has eroded in relation to other professions, she said, and about half of Wyoming’s new education hires are green with no teaching experience.
Stoddard recommended that the committee set the state’s funding model teaching salary to ensure the weighted average salary is equal to $70,560 for 2025/26. That, Stoddard said, would make Wyoming more competitive with Colorado and Utah, which tallied average teacher salaries around $70,000 in 2024/2025.
Kiley McConnell, a second-year teacher in Sheridan School District 3, urged the committee to make $70,000 the starting salary, not the average. In Sheridan County, where the average home costs $400,000, McConnell said, it’s not possible to buy a home on her current salary of $48,000. 
“The opportunity for me to be investing back in my community, wanting to stay where I am and continue to teach becomes more and more difficult because of the salary limits,” she testified. 
To be continued …
Housing strains came up several times during the meeting, along with issues like how to fund counselors, finding resources for increasing disciplinary needs, whether individual computer devices are necessary or harmful for students and the role that school nutrition can play in education. 
Lawmakers also expressed doubts about finding solutions to all the issues before them within the timeframe. And given Bear’s suggestion, several topics may have to wait until 2026 for more thorough investigation before the state determines how to fund them. 
Lawmakers also issued directions related to school insurance, reimbursement schedules, using a hedonic index to adjust costs over time and capital construction guide posts.

When asked at the meeting Wednesday what message the public can help spread about recalibration, Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, emphasized that the committee members take their task very seriously.
“We are going to commit to the people of the state of Wyoming, from my perspective, to do the very best job we possibly can with the resources that we have to take proper and just care of our kids,” Neiman said. 
People who are involved in education, he said, have students’ best interests in mind. “That’s not lost on this committee or on your Wyoming Legislature,” he said, but he noted that lawmakers have to balance those priorities with all the other constituent concerns.
The committee will take up the draft recalibration bill when it meets again Jan. 22-23 in Cheyenne.

You're more likely to spot the night-time fliers in the summer — just about anywhere in Wyoming, one bat lover says.
The post Spooky or just misunderstood? Wyoming’s wide variety of bats are mostly hibernating for Halloween. appeared first on WyoFile .","Your chances of seeing a bat on Halloween, unless it’s a store-bought decoration or a candy-collecting kid adorned with black wings, are very low — despite the wide variety of real ones that live in and migrate through Wyoming.
They’re most often spotted in the summer and during migration season in the fall. By tonight — the end of international Bat Week — most of the fury fliers are already hibernating, according to local experts. But the animal’s association with the spookiest night of the year is unavoidable, for good or ill, a Wyoming bat aficionado told WyoFile.

“It makes me laugh,” said Ellen Whittle, who, instead of finding bats spooky, describes them as “adorable,” “chill” and “fascinating.” Then again, those are descriptors you might expect from a wildlife biologist who researches bats.
Whittle serves as bat project manager for the Wyoming Natural Diversity Database at the Berry Biodiversity Conservation Center in Laramie. When she’s not searching for bats in the field, she’s always eager to intervene in a batty situation when one needs to be rescued from a potential human interaction on the University of Wyoming campus.

One call she regrets not getting was when a western spotted bat was seen chilling on the outside of the College of Education building. The local animal shelter took the call instead — which is appropriate, Whittle said. But the rare-for-Wyoming bat had already been relocated before she got a chance to observe it.
“I would have dropped everything to go see this bat,” Whittle told WyoFile. “Everyone in the bat profession wants to see a spotted bat. It’s like our white whale. I was so jealous.”

In a press release issued last week, the groups Vote Solar and the Sierra Club announced that they filed the petition and have asked the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, or PUC, to create  a working group to review the fairness of solar reimbursement rates before the next scheduled review in 2028.
“The PUC acknowledged that the Export Credit Rates are unreasonable and volatile, which is why they chose to limit this year’s changes and delay the next change until 2028,“ Lisa Young, Sierra Club Idaho Chapter director, said in a written statement. “But this is just a temporary Band-Aid. We need to come together to make real improvements to the methodology. Otherwise, communities in Idaho will face the same problem all over again in 2028.”
On Sept. 30, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission approved new, decreased reimbursements rates, which are called export credit rates, that Idaho Power pays its rooftop solar customers, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
The decreased solar power reimbursement rates apply to more than 14,000 Idaho Power customers who have rooftop solar systems or other on-site generation systems that were installed prior to Dec. 20, 2020. Idaho Power customers who had their solar systems installed prior to Dec. 20, 2020, are not subject to the decreased reimbursement rates because they are considered legacy customers and grandfathered in, officials said. 
Aside from rooftop solar panel systems, other types of on-site generation systems include wind systems, but solar systems are the most common. 
Idaho Power had applied to reduce solar reimbursement rates even further, but the utilities commission approved a smaller decrease after expressing concerns about the impact the change would have on solar customers. 
“The commission recognized that all customers have faced increases to their average monthly bills over the past 18 months, and the proposed update to the (export credit rate) would further affect customers in Schedules 6, 8 and 84,” the utilities commission said in a news release issued Oct. 2.
The commission is charged with regulating investor-owned utility companies that provide electricity, gas, water and some telephone services for a profit, according to the commission’s website. Examples of utilities the commission regulates include Idaho Power, Rocky Mountain Power and Intermountain Gas.

In an interview in October, Idaho Power officials said they request the decrease in reimbursement rates for their rooftop solar customers to more accurately reflect energy costs and avoid overcompensating customers who generate their own energy through rooftop solar systems.
Company spokesman Jordan Rodriguez told the Idaho Capital Sun that Idaho Power originally reimbursed its solar customers with the same retail rate that other customers paid on the electric bills. But Rodriguez said the original reimbursement rates did not take into account expenses that Idaho Power has to provide electricity, such as operating and maintaining the electrical grid and employing staff. 
“When some customers are being overcompensated with the full retail rate credit, the difference is made up by the rest of our customers, 98% of which do not have rooftop solar or other on-site generation,” Rodriguez said earlier in October.
Solar advocates who are asking for the Idaho Public Utilities Commission to review the fairness of solar reimbursement rates prior to 2028 say it is unfair to customers invested in solar panel systems to keep changing the reimbursement rates they are given.
“Families in Idaho turn to rooftop solar to gain stability and independence from unpredictable and ever-rising utility costs,” Kate Bowman, Vote Solar’s Interior West senior regulatory director, said in a written statement. “Unfortunately, the current solar export rate structure undermines that stability — it’s designed to change from year to year and is biased toward utility profits, leaving solar customers exposed to unpredictable energy bills and unfair compensation rates.”

(Photo:John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)With the looming prospect of federal food aid disappearing for nearly 1 in 10 Tennesseans starting Saturday, state Democratic lawmakers – and at least one Republican – have urged Gov. Bill Lee to follow the example of other state governors in taking action. 
Lee, who’s out of state this week on an economic trip to Asia, has thus far declined to tap state resources to help mitigate the loss of more than $145 million in monthly food aid intended for the state’s poorest residents – among them more than 300,000 children living in poverty. 
Instead, Lee, a Republican, blamed Democrats in Congress for the government shutdown that has frozen the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, a federally funded program that loads about $340 a month onto a debit card for a family of four to use at the grocery store.
“Their failure to fund federal nutrition programs cannot be solved by states, and the void cannot be filled with temporary fixes that would only drain state resources and prolong the misery of this shutdown,” Lee said in a statement.
Lee announced Thursday he had set up a website, www.feedtn.org, to connect Tennesseans in need of food with local pantries. 
A high percentage of rural Tennesseans use SNAP, as funding set to dry up

At least 24 other states, however, have found ways to tap into funding to bridge the loss of November SNAP benefits. 
In Louisiana, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry announced he would direct $150 million from the state’s health department budget to aid SNAP recipients. In New Mexico, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said $30 million in state-funded food benefits will be loaded onto existing SNAP debit cards to help New Mexicans buy food through Nov. 10. 
A coalition of 25 Democrat-led states also sued the federal government seeking an emergency court order to restore federal SNAP funding before it runs out on Nov. 1. A Massachusetts federal judge said she would soon rule on their emergency request to force the Trump administration to tap contingency funds to provide November SNAP benefits.
The Trump administration has warned states they will not be reimbursed for using funding to aid SNAP recipients during the government shutdown.
Tennessee lawmakers urge Lee to act
The Tennessee Senate Democratic Caucus on Thursday sent a letter to Lee urging the governor to declare a state of emergency to coordinate hunger relief in the state. 
“Under a state of emergency, your administration would be empowered to utilize all available state resources, direct emergency funds, expand local food assistance, and bolster the capacity of food banks and faith-based groups already doing God’s work in our communities,” the Democrats wrote.
Republican Sen. Paul Bailey of Sparta, on Thursday, urged Lee “to find a way to protect Tennessee families from losing access to essential food assistance benefits.”
“We can’t wait on the federal government to act,” Bailey said in a statement. “Tennessee should take the lead in meeting this challenge. Let’s show the rest of the country what it looks like when leaders put people before politics and compassion before bureaucracy.”
Tennessee currently has more than $2 billion in its state rainy day fund that could be tapped, Democratic lawmakers noted. 
Tennessee governor warns of SNAP lapse, blames Democrats for shutdown

SNAP is funded by the federal government and administered by the Tennessee Department of Human Services, which contracts with an outside vendor to electronically load SNAP cash benefits onto debit cards families use at the grocery store.
On Thursday, Department of Human Services Commissioner Clarence Carter told lawmakers in a House committee hearing that, even if state funding were made available, the vendor the state relies on to distribute SNAP dollars to 690,000 Tennesseans has no mechanism to tap state funds.
The vendor is only able to access a federal line of credit to refill the SNAP debit cards, he said. 
“We don’t have the ability to recreate that mechanism overnight,” he said. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Human Services did not respond to questions about the SNAP distribution system. 
Vermont, which operates a similar system to distribute federal SNAP aid, announced Wednesday it would reprogram its debit card system to distribute more than $6 million in funding to its residents.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC04521-copy-1024x601.jpg,,,2025-10-31 06:16:53.172274

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

A combined total of more than $2.5 million has been spent by an array of outside groups seeking to influence school board races in some of Colorado’s largest public school districts. More than half of that has been spent on races for the Denver Public Schools board, where a deep-pocketed reform group hopes to wrest control away from candidates backed by teachers unions.
Colorado holds coordinated off-year elections to choose candidates for certain school boards, municipal offices and other local races, often alongside one or more statewide ballot issues. In 2025, Colorado lawmakers have referred two measures to the ballot, Propositions LL and MM, which would shore up funding for the state’s universal school meals program.

Election Day is Nov. 4. Voters who have already received their ballot can return it by dropping it off in a secure drop box or at an in-person polling location. It’s too late to return a ballot through the mail, or to receive a new or replacement ballot through the mail, but all eligible voters can still register and vote in person by visiting a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
Information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites. Voters can sign up for the state’s BallotTrax system, which tracks the status of ballots and notifies voters when their ballot is received and counted.
Super PAC spending
Once again, board elections in Colorado’s largest public school district are being heavily influenced by an independent expenditure committee known as Better Leaders, Stronger Schools. The group spent more than $1 million on DPS races in 2023, helping its endorsed candidates sweep the three seats up for election that year, and it’s on pace to break the $1 million mark again in 2025.
Independent expenditure committees, also known as super PACs, can spend unlimited sums of money to influence elections but are barred from coordinating directly with candidates.
The Better Leaders, Stronger Schools committee’s top donor, Denver Families Action, was founded in 2020 and has roots in the pro-charter “school reform” movement, though its leaders say they have broadened their focus to issues of declining enrollment and school safety, while pivoting away from past reform priorities like standardized testing. The group also received a $40,000 contribution from billionaire Republican megadonor Phil Anschutz in September, according to campaign finance disclosures.
The second-largest overall super PAC spender in 2025 is Students Deserve Better, a group funded by the Colorado Education Association, the statewide teachers union. The PAC has reported spending a combined total of $821,348 to support candidates in a half dozen school board races across the state. About a third of that total was spent to support union-backed DPS candidates.
Colorado Springs
Students Deserve Better has also spent $216,296 to influence board races in Colorado Springs School District 11, where seven candidates are vying for three seats elected at large. In 2024, the District 11 board’s conservative majority voted to end its collective bargaining agreement with the Colorado Springs Education Association, a decision that hundreds of teachers protested in a one-day strike earlier this month.
D11 Parents and Teachers, a new super PAC registered in September, has spent over $140,000 to support conservative candidates. Disclosures show that the group is wholly funded by Advance Colorado, a right-wing “dark money” group that does not disclose its donors.
Douglas County
In Douglas County, a suburban battleground where school board politics have been fractious in recent years, the biggest spender to date is Colorado Labor Action, a committee that has spent $129,815 to support a slate of union-backed candidates. The PAC reported receiving a single contribution of $130,000 from a group affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers in early October.
Meanwhile, a conservative slate of candidates in Douglas County has benefited from over $62,000 in spending by Neighbors for a Better Colorado, another newly registered super PAC. The group has also reported spending on behalf of conservative school board candidates in Durango and the campaign of veteran GOP operative Roger Hudson for Castle Pines mayor. It has received two contributions totaling $115,000 from RTR Research Inc., a nonprofit registered in Colorado last year. RTR Research’s articles of incorporation were filed by election attorney and former Republican secretary of state Scott Gessler.

(Getty Images)Across the country, career and technical education is reshaping ideas of what high school should be, and momentum continues to build. Enrollment is rising, states are investing heavily and politicians on both sides of the aisle see CTE as a practical way to prepare students for good jobs in a changing economy, without requiring them to take on more education debt than necessary. As a result, states are now incorporating CTE measures into their accountability systems, signaling that success after high school isn’t measured solely by test scores or four-year college enrollment.
On the surface, this is good news. Today’s CTE looks nothing like the “vocational ed” of the past. Students are earning credentials and college credits in fields like health sciences, IT, engineering, and advanced manufacturing. And the results are clear: Rigorous studies show that high-quality CTE increases graduation rates, boosts college enrollment and improves access to well-paying jobs, whether it’s after college or in a skilled trade.
But beneath the headline numbers lies a harder truth: In too many places, CTE remains a loose set of electives with little structure or alignment to industry standards. Courses may look modern, such as “Intro to Business,” but without clear pathways or rigorous content, they rarely lead to meaningful skills, credentials or good jobs. Much like other “evidence-based” initiatives, how a program is structured matters much more than whether or not it is offered.
Combining higher education and K-12 posts could have lasting impacts

The danger of low-quality CTE is that it risks giving a false sense of progress. Labeling courses “career-ready” doesn’t make them so. Worse, inequities creep in if students are steered into career tracks with weaker labor market returns. And we’ve seen this film before: In the 1960s, federal vocational education bills promised to reduce inequality but by the 1980s, it was clear that the system had too often reinforced tracking, essentially segregating some students from rigorous academic coursework. Without high standards and greater accountability, low-quality CTE risks repeating that history.
So, what distinguishes CTE programs that truly pay off from those that don’t? By studying models that have demonstrated success, we can identify the features that should be scaled across more schools. A new EdResearch for Action brief does exactly this, looking across the existing research to identify clear lessons about what makes CTE programs high-quality.
The strongest CTE programs offer structured, sequenced pathways, not a few disconnected electives. Students who take at least three aligned courses in a single career area consistently fare better than those who take standalone courses. Benefits accrue to these students in the form of higher graduation rates, as well as either higher college enrollment or stronger earnings. High-quality programs also make work-based learning a core feature rather than an afterthought. Well-designed internships, apprenticeships and employer-linked projects give students the kind of hands-on experience that builds both confidence and skills.
Just as important are partnerships with employers and with colleges. Industry partners ensure students are learning on up-to-date equipment and tackling relevant problems; higher education partners create early-credit opportunities and smooth transitions into degree programs. The most effective programs also recruit teachers with real-world experience, valuing practical expertise as much as traditional certification.
Finally, equity must be a design principle, not an afterthought. Schools should make sure CTE courses fit within students’ schedules, expand access to underrepresented groups, and track participation and outcomes to identify gaps. After all, the promise of CTE is not simply to prepare some students for good jobs but to ensure every student can connect learning to opportunity.
Nebraska is taking a bold approach in rural communities with its reVISION initiative.
Rather than leaving small districts to build programs in isolation, the state requires each district to conduct a data-driven needs assessment and supports regional collaboration through reVISION Action Grants. Districts then pool resources, staff and industry partnerships to design stronger, more equitable programs.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The result: regional CTE hubs, mobile labs, and virtual courses that bring specialized programs like cybersecurity to even the most remote towns. By embedding collaboration and workforce alignment into state policy, Nebraska shows how geography doesn’t have to limit opportunity.
Washington state is rethinking who can teach CTE through its Business & Industry (B&I) pathway, which allows skilled professionals with substantial industry experience to get certified without a bachelor’s degree. Candidates complete a streamlined pedagogy program, making it easier for industry experts to transition into classrooms. This approach maintains instructional training requirements and expands and diversifies the CTE teacher pipeline so that students learn from educators who know both their craft and how to teach it.
Ultimately, high-quality CTE is tied to real-world experiences that are hard to measure, vary across states, and available data provide only a partial picture. The federal government has a key role to play in tracking the results of these programs. Yet the latest proposal from the federal government would scale back what little we already collect, making it even harder to identify high-quality programs. 
If Washington is serious about preparing students for good jobs, it should strengthen, not shrink, its role in collecting and sharing useful data. We lack the equivalent of a “Nation’s Report Card” for career readiness: common, rigorous measures that show which programs align with labor-market needs and promote economic opportunity. Without stronger data and federal leadership, CTE risks becoming a black box: highly visible in name but opaque in impact.
To deliver on the promise of CTE, we cannot settle for programs that look good on paper but fail to prepare students for real opportunity. Every student needs access to a rigorous program connected to postsecondary education and local workforce needs. That’s not the case today, but it can be, if leaders prioritize quality and equity in every CTE investment they make.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer-Focht/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee National Guard soldiers could be patrolling Memphis for up to a year, lending credence to the governor’s prediction that the crime task force in Memphis could be permanent.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth notified Gov. Bill Lee in a Sept. 23 letter that the U.S. Department of Defense is prepared to authorize and fund up to 1,000 Tennessee National Guard personnel to work with the Memphis Safe Task Force through September 2026.
“Tennessee, particularly in Memphis, is currently facing a convergence of public safety threats that exceed the capacity of local law enforcement agencies,” Hegseth, a Sumner County resident, said in the letter.
The Lookout obtained the letter in a public records request for communications between the Trump administration and Lee’s people, most of which the state rejected as falling under attorney-client privilege. 
Despite a major crime reduction in the first part of 2025, Hegseth said Memphis’ violent crime rates remain among the nation’s highest and local law enforcement has reported difficulty staffing the force. All of that is compounded by the city’s location along interstates, making it a distribution hub for narcotics trafficking and organized crime, Hegseth said. 
Tennessee National Guard personnel started patrolling in Memphis as part of a federal, state and local crime task force about a month ago. Lee said recently he believes the crime-fighting surge should “last forever.”
Unarmed Guard personnel, who are mainly walking the streets and talking to people, are considered a godsend by some and a waste of time and money by others.. 
A group of state and local officials responded by filing suit over the deployment last week, saying it violates the Tennessee Constitution.
A representative of Democracy Forward, a nonprofit group handling the lawsuit, said the mobilization is a “direct violation of the state Constitution.” The Guard shouldn’t be deployed unless a rebellion or invasion is taking place, and even then, the local government has to request it or the legislature has to approve it, attorney Yenisey Rodriguez said.

But Hegseth wrote in his letter to Lee that National Guard personnel would be operating under a status that supports the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security in Memphis “consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act.” The act generally prohibits federal forces from being used for law enforcement, but Hegseth said it doesn’t apply to the National Guard in this case, “allowing them to engage in law enforcement operations under the authorities of the requesting Federal agencies.” 
The secretary added that his office expects the departments of Justice and Homeland Security will request support for law enforcement presence in high-crime neighborhoods, as well as assistance with narcotics interdiction and logistical and communications support with local agencies.
Asked about a potential year-long stay by the Guard, state Rep. Jesse Chism, a Memphis Democrat, said he doesn’t think the soldiers are needed at all, much less for a year.
“The work that I’ve heard of them doing is mostly of a support nature, and that they are not the ones taking the dangerous criminals off of our streets. I think their purpose in our city is more to make a political statement than anything else.”
“I continue to believe that a better course of action would be to take the funding we are spending on the National Guard and investing it in the men and women of the Memphis Police Department who were already making a difference in our community,” Chism said.
More than likely, though, it could go on “forever, forever, forever …”
“Come on and tell me who are you”
Republican nominee Matt Van Epps launched an ad this week attacking his opponent, Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn, calling her a “woke liberal” and castigating her for chasing federal agents and state troopers during a summer sweep of South Nashville, an area heavily populated with immigrants.
It’s the first real salvo for the 7th Congressional District seat vacated by Mark Green.
Behn responded by telling the Lookout, “I’m not surprised his first ad is negative because he doesn’t want to talk about rising healthcare costs or releasing the Epstein files.”
Truth be told, Van Epps hasn’t talked about anything with the Lookout, despite repeated efforts to see where he stands on issues ranging from a federal bill to keep SNAP (formerly food stamps) from lapsing, the constitutionality of the federal buildup in Memphis, inflation and economic uncertainty and how he plans to maintain momentum in the race heading toward the Dec. 2 special election.

The Van Epps campaign got so busy it forgot to answer the latter queries the Lookout sent by email last week. Then Van Epps refused to talk to a Lookout reporter this week before a Tennessee Roundtable conference at the State Library and Archives. 
These were not tough questions designed to trick the candidate. But alas, we must figure he’s aligning himself with President Donald Trump on every topic, since he adopted the “MAGA Matt” mantra during the Republican primary.
Behn, on the other hand, is more than willing to respond to questions, most likely because she’s playing from behind in a red district.
Asked if she supported a Republican-backed emergency plan to save SNAP benefits in November, Behn said both parties in Washington need to “get their act together” and reopen the government, fund the food program and stop the “spike” in healthcare costs.
Some states are responding to the emergency by suing to renew SNAP. Others are trying to come up with the money. Tennessee set up a website telling people where they might be able to go to find food.
The Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee is urging people to help. Otherwise, that Thanksgiving turkey is going to be mighty lean.
Where do we go from here?
Republican Rep. Mary Littleton of Dickson announced this week she will not seek re-election next year after consulting with her family and physician. She has spent most of her 13 years in the General Assembly working on children’s issues.
Candidates are lining up for the chance to replace retiring Rep. Johnny Shaw, a Bolivar Democrat. (Tennessee General Assembly)
Likewise, Democratic Rep. Johnny Shaw of Bolivar has said he will not run for re-election, ending a 20-plus-year run in the legislature. Bolivar Mayor Julian McTizic is running for the seat as a Republican along with several Democrats, including Andrea Bond Johnson, a financial advisor who has twice run against Rep. Chris Hurt in House District 82.
Shaw, who often goes back to his preaching roots, objected to making the Bible the state’s official book.
Case dismissed
U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson dismissed state Rep. Justin Jones’ lawsuit against House Speaker Cameron Sexton and three staff members over expulsion and ensuing punishment for violating House rules. (Since when did decorum amount to a hill of beans in that joint?)
Jones filed the suit claiming, in part, his constitutional rights to free speech and due process were violated in the expulsion and then when he was removed from a committee and prohibited from speaking on the House floor for violating new rules adopted in 2024.
Richardson found that Jones, a Nashville Democrat, didn’t have standing in his complaint against House Chief Clerk Tammy Letzler, who notified him about the penalties, or House Sergeant at Arms Bobby Trotter, who turned off his keycard to Cordell Hull entry.
Tennessee representative  pushes lawsuit against House speaker

The judge did determine that he had standing to sue Sexton and Assistant Chief Clerk and Parliamentarian Daniel Hicks. But then Richardson found they had legislative immunity to all of Jones’ claims and tossed the lawsuit.
For those whose memory is getting worse than mine, Jones was half of the duo expelled for taking over the House floor in an anti-gun protest following the mass shooting at The Covenant School in 2023. (Rep. Gloria Johnson narrowly escaped expulsion when Republicans’ video showed her humming and twiddling her thumbs while Jones and Rep. Justin Pearson shouted and used a bullhorn to fire up the balcony audience that day.)
Sexton and the Republican-controlled House adopted new rules the following session to control public entrance to the balconies and keep disturbances down. It led to Jones’ statement that Sexton was “drunk with power,” which didn’t exactly endear him to the speaker. His seat on the Government Operations Committee was subsequently vacated, and he lost House time, which affected his state benefits. The judge, though, decided Jones couldn’t show enough personal injury because he’s back on the committee.
Clearly, the rules were designed to stop Jones, Pearson and those dratted rabble-rousers from regaining any semblance of footing on the House floor. But the judge determined the rules were adopted by the entire House, not Hicks or Sexton.
It should be noted that these rules led to off-the-record discussions during House sessions to decide the outcome of indiscretions. Someone pointed out these little rules parsings are worse than NFL video reviews because viewers don’t even have a chance to go to the fridge for another beer.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)In August of 2024, the Center for American Progress released an analysis of how the Heritage Foundation’s 920-page document Project 2025 would impact each state.
The center indicated that if Project 2025 were implemented, West Virginia residents would eventually: 

Experience a tax increase of $2,185 for the average West Virginia family. People exceeding an annual income of $10 million would get a cut of $1.5 million.
Be forced to delay retirement to 69, negatively affecting 1.2 million West Virginia residents.
Have 70,000 West Virginia residents lose Medicaid coverage due to “lifetime caps.”
Be forced to pay more for prescription drugs by ending the current Medicare drug cost limitations, affecting 140,540 residents. 
Lose Head Start causing 8,480 low-income West Virginia children to be without day care. 
See 1,378 West Virginia teaching positions, serving 18,598 students, eliminated when Title I is abolished.

Back then, President Donald Trump claimed he knew nothing about it. Yes, Trump never read it. However, he appointed Russell Vought — the mastermind behind Project 2025 — to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
Post election, Trump stated he would be meeting with “Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.” 
In his second term, Trump has been following Project 2025 right down to the smallest details. 
For example:
— Under Project 2025, the Affordable Care Act (p 468) was to be gutted. Medicaid expansion would be limited by adding bureaucratic, unenforceable “work requirements.” Mission accomplished and numerous West Virginia residents will suffer.
— Project 2025 politicizes health care, stating, “Cultural institutions like public libraries and public health agencies are only as ‘independent’ from public accountability as elected officials and voters permit.” Classifying public health departments as “cultural” versus health care provisions opens public health up to politics. Thus, it opens the way for a lawyer like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to be undercutting science and redefining the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccines policy. Mission accomplished.
— The conservative plan advocated doing away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (p 869) which it incorrectly classifies “as a shakedown mechanism to provide unaccountable funding to leftist nonprofits politically aligned with those who spearheaded its creation.” The Trump administration is vocally advocating for this approach and is well on its way to succeeding. Thus, consumers will again be left with no advocate for their interests while big business (Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, etc.) contributes money to the MAGA cause.
— Project 2025 (p 693) advocates “legislation that would ‘effectively abolish’ the Federal Reserve and replace it with ‘free banking,’ whereby ‘neither interest rates nor the supply of money’ would be ‘controlled by government.’” Trump’s moves to gain control of the Fed are the first step towards accomplishing this goal. Such a move would have disastrous economic consequences, leading to another Great Depression.
— Project 2025’s plan is to slash the size of the federal workforce (p 20), politicizing it while hindering its ability to function. This is based on the radical right assumption that there exists a “largely underworked, over-compensated, and unaccountable federal civilian workforce.” Along the same lines, the Trump administration is advised to “fill its ranks with political appointees” who would “overcome the federal government’s obstructionist Human Resources departments.” Mission accomplished.
— The federal Department of Education (c11, p365) would be abolished, and student aid slashed under Project 2025(c11, p385). Our public education system (c11, p390) would be undercut in favor of a stronger private sector presence. Trump is implementing these policies.
— Project 2025 slashes environmental regulations on businesses (c13, p440) while gutting Environmental Protection Agency regulations as well (p425/p 450). The strange rationale given is that the EPA is a “breeding ground for expansion of federal government influence” and that Democrats have a “global climate themed agenda.” Clearly, the authors want to ignore the severe climate threat facing the world.
 — Energy production via fossil fuels would be increased on federal lands (c16, p600) while federal funding for renewable energy projects would be cut (c12, p405). “A new Administration must immediately roll back Biden’s orders, reinstate the Trump-era Energy Dominance Agenda” (p 521). The Trump administration is implementing these policies while the environmental impact of these changes is ignored.
Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts stated prior to Trump’s second term, “We are in the process of the second American Revolution.” Unfortunately, with the U.S. Supreme Court having been packed by the extreme right and a GOP Congress bowing down to presidential whims, Roberts may be correct.

LNG liquefaction plant and export terminal on Sabine Pass in Cameron Parish. (Matthew White/Getty Images)New research shows a continuous pattern of air pollution violations from liquified natural gas export facilities in Southwest Louisiana. 
Three LNG export facilities in Cameron Parish are featured in a report from the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit research organization. 
Sourced from federal and state data, the report documents federal Clean Air Act infractions for each of the past 12 quarters – spanning three years – at Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass LNG terminal and Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal. The Cameron LNG export terminal in Hackberry has been out of compliance with the Clean Air Act for 11 of the past 12 quarters. 
Report author and Environmental Integrity Project research manager Alexandra Shaykevich spoke at a press event about the “terrible compliance record” for the LNG industry, noting that Southwest Louisiana facilities in particular have been in “nearly continuous” violation of the Clean Air Act for the past three years.
Venture Global and Cameron LNG did not respond to requests for comment on the report. Cheniere Energy had no comment.

Cameron Parish resident John Allaire lives within 30 miles of the three LNG facilities highlighted in the report – and six more that are planned or under construction.
“I live in the eye of this LNG hurricane,” Allaire said at a news conference this week announcing the report’s release.
Allaire’s home sits close enough to the Venture Global facility for him to see fiery plumes of methane flares from his patio. The Commonwealth LNG facility is planned 750 feet away from his property line, he said. 
“I’m surrounded on all sides,” he said. “It’s not the same coastal wetland estuary that it used to be.”
While each terminal provided varying explanations for its violations, Shaykevich said, common ones include: 

failure to report excess emissions and permit deviations to state regulators; 
exceeding allowed pollution limits for contaminants such as nitrous oxide, volatile organic compounds and sulphur dioxide; and 
failure to properly operate equipment meant to control pollution levels. 

Cameron LNG’s Clean Air Act violations included at least 89 instances of excess pollution that released thousands of pounds of benzine, a known carcinogen, from the facility into the surrounding environment, according to the report’s analysis of Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality records. 
“We need these companies to actually be good neighbors and not to continue causing suffering in the communities in which they operate,” said James Hiatt, director of local nonprofit For a Better Bayou at the news conference. 
Each of the three facilities had only two air enforcement actions opened from LDEQ, according to the report. Cheniere Energy had paid $225,000 in fines as of July 29, when state records were analyzed, for air quality violations. Financial penalties hadn’t yet been finalized for the other two facilities before the Environmental Integrity Project published its report. 
The report also included tallies of Clean Water Act violations for LNG terminals in Southwest Louisiana. Sabine Pass was out of compliance with the act’s standards for 8 of the past 12 quarters. Cameron LNG had violations in seven quarters, and Calcasieu had just one quarter with water-related infractions.
Cameron LNG had 27 effluent violations from July 2020 through June 2025. Sabine Pass had nine and Calcasieu Pass recorded one over the same period, according to the report’s analysis. The violations at Cameron LNG and Sabine Pass involved fecal coliform and suspended solids, such as algae, bacteria and industrial particles. The lone issue at Calcalsieu Pass involved only suspended solids. 
Shaykevich said the pattern of permit violations for existing facilities should be a factor in approving new facilities as the LNG industry continues its rapid expansion. 
“President Trump has aggressively promoted the liquefied natural gas industry, including by directing agencies to fast track certain approvals for LNG projects,” he said. “State and federal agencies should be slowing down and more carefully scrutinizing new applications for LNG export projects instead of speeding up permit reviews.”

The city of nearly 2,000 people is the county seat for Crawford County in the northern part of Michigan’s Lower Peninsula. Matt Vasilogambros/StatelineWhen I first joined Progress Michigan, I was excited to become the organization’s first rural communications coordinator. Having organized in very conservative small towns in Michigan, I knew there was important work to be done to drive forward a winning progressive narrative about how to lower costs and deliver a better future for folks who have historically been left behind.
For too long, people of all political stripes have discounted rural communities. I’m proud of the work I’ve put in to make this important change happen, but I also know there is still so much more to be done. This past week, Progress Michigan and nearly 40 other organizations from across the country released the 2025 Rural Policy Action Report.
The report outlines practical steps that Congress can take to immediately deliver for the American people –– something that is desperately needed right now.
Complete dysfunction in Washington is on full display this month. The government is shut down while the White House and congressional leadership are ignoring the upcoming deadline to prevent massive cost increases to health care. On top of that, farmers are unsure of when their next payments are going to arrive and families don’t know when they’re going to receive their food assistance, all while the White House uses our taxpayer dollars to knock down the East Wing and pay for a gaudy ballroom.











At the end of the day the majority of us believe we have a right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and earn a fair wage while having a safe place to call home.


– Levi Teitel, Progress Michigan communications coordinator


Wealthy corporate interests stoke fear and division in order to distract us from the real problems plaguing rural communities across the country, and we must chart a path forward. The Rural Policy Action Report provides a roadmap for how we can make needed reinvestments to ensure everyone has a fair shot at economic success.
Whether you live in Marquette or Monroe or somewhere in between, most of us believe that we all need lower costs, higher wages and the freedom to make choices about our own lives in order to thrive. The 2025 Rural Policy Action Report gives specifics for how our elected officials can make this a reality for everyone. As rural communities and small towns continue to feel the impacts of consolidation, lack of federal investment and rising authoritarianism, folks are looking for answers to deliver prosperity and fairness.
The report provides a positive agenda to improve rural people’s lives and deliver lower costs, higher wages, and the freedom to make choices about our own lives. Since the original 2021 Rural Policy Action Report, we’ve achieved major victories like expanding low-cost renewable energy and preventing corporate mergers fueled by greed — proving that when we organize we can make change. However, many of those successes have been reversed in 2025, and new policies have added even more barriers to the future and strong communities we deserve. The report provides a detailed accounting of the progress and rollbacks of the priorities in previous reports.
To reshape the government for working people, the report highlights 26 policy priorities, organized into four pillars.


Rein in corporate greed and support workers, small businesses, and farmers


Invest in foundational infrastructure for thriving communities


Everyone gets a fair deal – no one should be discriminated against or excluded from the benefits of pillars 1 and 2


Steward our land and natural resources for a prosperous and sustainable future


The reforms in the report are popular. I know this because I’ve talked to people across the state about these needs. Regardless of our ZIP code or our background, most people believe in the core values that bind together these policies.
At the end of the day the majority of us believe we have a right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and earn a fair wage while having a safe place to call home. That’s what the American dream is all about –– it’s an aspirational vision for what we know we can achieve. Rural communities have an important role to play in creating this change, and we can start by listening to one another and finding common ground.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, helps feed about 275,000 West Virginians, or one in six state residents. Nearly 40% of those recipients are children.

Families who need assistance finding local pantries may call 211 or visit wv211.org.

Due to the federal government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, said “there will be no benefits issued” Nov. 1.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced this week he plans to give up to $13 million in state dollars to food banks and called on residents to match the contribution. Funding SNAP directly — about $47 million — isn’t the best option right now, according to the governor.
The state’s SNAP electronic benefits management company, Fidelity Information Services, is unable to accept direct state funding, according to the governor’s office. 
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, on Thursday noted an Oct. 24 memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that the agency would not use contingency funds to fund food stamps during the shutdown. 
She said the state cannot directly fund SNAP due to the change at Fidelity. 
“So even if we gave the money to the [West Virginia] Department of Human Services, they would not be able to directly load that money into SNAP accounts,” Young said. “So the best thing we can do is to fund our food banks. I realize that is not the same thing, but we don’t have the capacity to fund SNAP benefits because the federal government has taken an unprecedented move to stop the system.”
Morrisey posted on his X account Oct. 29 that Fidelity “does not believe that sending money through EBT is feasible over the next few months.” 
“This is why we’re proceeding with our plan which is the quickest way to get food to people who are in need,” he wrote. 
Caitlin Cook, director of advocacy and public policy at Mountaineer Food Bank, said SNAP is the most effective tool the country has to fight hunger. For every one meal the charitable food network food provides, SNAP provides nine, she said. 










There is no way the charitable food network can make up the full difference that SNAP benefits provide to the 144,000 households that received SNAP.


– Caitlin Cook, director of advocacy and public policy at Mountaineer Food Bank


“There is no way the charitable food network can make up the full difference that SNAP benefits provide to the 144,000 households that received SNAP,” Cook said. 
House Democrats ask Morrisey, GOP lawmakers to appropriate more food money 
In a news conference Thursday, Young and other Democrats in the West Virginia House of Delegates called on Morrisey and federal leaders to do more to address the SNAP crisis. They suggested calling a special legislative session so that lawmakers might appropriate money to food banks. 
W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, said Morrisey has not done enough. 
“It takes $1.5 million a day to feed hungry mountaineers,” Hornbuckle said. “Ladies and gentlemen, we have over $60 million in surplus. We have a medical cannabis fund. We could even follow the lead of Ohio Gov. [Mike] Dewine, who tapped their Rainy Day Fund. There are outlets out there that we could be doing right now. It’s a dire situation.
“And so what we are doing as a caucus, we are asking to call us in a special session, whatever it is that needs to be done,” Hornbuckle said. “We will work together to get this thing done.”
Senate President Randy Smith did not respond to a question about whether the Republican-led Legislature would consider dipping into the state’s $1.4 billion in Rainy Day Fund for food banks. 
Lawmakers can utilize the Rainy Day Fund, an emergency fund of sorts, to cover acts of God, budget shortfalls and other things solely at the discretion of the Legislature.
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, was unable to answer questions for this story due to scheduling conflicts. During Morrisey’s press conference earlier this week, Hanshaw said food security is part of the government’s primary jobs of infrastructure and public safety. He applauded the governor for filling in the gap left by a “dysfunctional federal government.”
“Certainly no element of public safety rings more true to citizens, certainly across our state than food security,” Hanshaw said. “And in an environment in which food security is already a baked in problem that we in our communities experience every day, a federal government that has abdicated its responsibility to do basic services and provide basic funding for the functions of government is unacceptable.”
House Democrats also noted that Morrisey could dip into $500 million sitting in the governor’s contingency fund. 
Cook said that the federal government shutdown has also meant that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Commodity Supplemental Food Program has also been on pause, which means that food assistance programs have less food inventory to distribute. 
The increased demand on feeding programs will come from multiple sources — including federal workers who are going without paychecks, people who aren’t receiving their SNAP benefits, and other people who are food insecure but ineligible for the SNAP program, she said. 
“So, the pressure is mounting on a charitable food network that’s already been stressed before this government shutdown,” Cook said. 
Drew Galang, spokesperson for Morrisey, said that, “The state continues to evaluate plans to prevent our citizens from going hungry should the federal shutdown continue past the first few weeks of November.”
He added that Morrisey’s actions to expedite and authorize over $14 million, which includes money allocated by lawmakers earlier this year for food banks, was expected to provide food assistance to SNAP recipients for up to two weeks.

The sessions were to gather feedback on the qualifications they hope to see for the university’s next president. Many took the opportunity to express grievances to the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees and consultants of executive headhunting firm, AGB Search. 
Since May, the top job at Jackson State has been vacant. Marcus Thompson resigned as president less than two years into his tenure without explanation from the IHL board, which oversees and selects the university’s presidents. 
Thompson was the third president to depart in five years — in similar fashion to his two predecessors, Thomas Hudson and William Bynum. 
State lawmakers and supporters of Jackson State have repeatedly criticized the board’s opaque search process, calling for a fair, transparent national leadership search for the university.

Many say the constant leadership turnover has caused tremendous strain on the reputation and growth of  Jackson State, Mississippi’s largest HBCU located in the state’s capital.  
Like Woods, stakeholders said they didn’t want their next leader to be someone who can “meet the criteria,” but a president with a proven track record to hold administrators accountable, address ongoing challenges and ensure student success. 
Since August, the board search committee has collected input from constituents in an effort to build the job candidate profile. Kim Bobby, a consultant with AGB Search, told Mississippi Today that feedback shared from participants, including public comments made through IHL’s portal, will be used for the candidate vetting and recruitment process, which can take up to eight weeks. Consultants said they anticipate releasing the candidate profile for a national search in the next few weeks. 
‘People need to come out of the ivory tower’ 
Faculty and staff said they hope their next leader can mend relationships among colleagues in departments, boost salaries, address pay inequities and invest in research and academic programs, internships and opportunities for students. 
Dawn Bishop McLin, psychology professor, said the campus community has experienced trauma, likely from the exhaustion and frustration with the board’s search process these past few years. It has affected morale for anyone connected to the university. 
McLin would know. Her months-long federal lawsuit reached a tentative settlement agreement with IHL and Jackson State this summer after she was placed on leave pending termination in 2024. 
She said the university needs a leader who can “get back to the basics” and have “strong core values” like integrity and accountability and who will, most importantly, emphasize education and service.

“People need to come out of the ivory tower,” McLin said. “They need to walk the campus, they need to talk to the students. Talk to faculty. Jackson State has seeds of greatness that never left. We just need someone to nurture it.” 
Robby Luckett, professor of history and director of the Margaret Walker Center, said he believes in Jackson State. An investment in the HBCU can challenge predominantly white institutions like the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State University. But, it all begins with leadership, he said. 
“We have the opportunity to make this institution the envy of everyone in this state,” Luckett said. “If we have the right leadership, the right support from IHL and people above that, it could happen.” 
‘The future of this institution is in the hands of this next president’

 Students said they want the next Jackson State president to prioritize student housing, campus safety and student input. When they voice concerns about mistreatment of faculty, staff and administrators, they said they want officials to respect their feedback.
Just days before fall semester began, dozens of students were left without housing assignments, scrambling to figure out where they would live. More than 380 students signed a petition this semester calling on the administration to acknowledge the university’s housing shortage. 
Madison Jackson, a freshman affected by this situation, now lives a 25-minute drive off campus. She now has to plan her day based on whether staff can resolve issues before driving to campus. Many students refer to the phone conversations with staff as “bad customer service.” She wants the next president to address this problem. 
“Communication is really bad, honestly,” Jackson said. 
Jakari Holland, a junior studying political science, told consultants to make sure their next leader is vetted carefully. As a student leader on campus, he has seen Jackson State move away from being a “safe haven” to “a place where students don’t want to be.” He wants student voices considered when it comes to the decision making process.
“The future of this institution is in the hands of this next president,” Holland said. “We pay money here. And, we just need to make sure they are actually here for the people.” 
‘We want to get close to John A. Peoples’ 
Alumni and community residents expressed that the late notice about the campus listening sessions didn’t provide enough time and opportunity for the IHL board and AGB Search to engage with stakeholders. 
“It seems like you’re setting the pace already by the way you’re conducting the presidential search,” May Frances Bridges, a retired Jackson State employee and alum, said. 
Bridges said she had to make a few calls to catch a ride to the sessions. The Jackson State Tigers also played  Grambling University in a game in Las Vegas over the weekend, which could have made turnout for these sessions fairly low the first day, she said.

King/Mississippi Today
State lawmakers and city officials who participated told consultants they are looking for a leader who cares about the city of Jackson, its residents and community at large. 
“I don’t think we will ever see another John A. Peoples but we want to get close to John A. Peoples,” said Sen. Sollie Norwood, a Democrat from Jackson and 1974 JSU alumnus. 
Peoples, who served as university president from 1967-1984, is widely regarded as the university’s best president. Many alumni shared stories of their experience under his leadership and how he emphasized the need to respect the campus community to survive and thrive. 
“Everybody wants to be treated with dignity and respect and that’s what he exemplified and that’s what we were accustomed too,” Bridges said, echoing Norwood’s public comment regarding Peoples.

Norwood also said he is looking for a leader whose “toolbox” includes fundraising. Over time, the Legislature has decreased funding support for all state public universities, including Jackson State. Having a leader who can build relationships with politicians and “access funds” will make a difference. 
Mayor John Horhn wants Jackson State’s next leader to be willing to partner with the city leaders to create jobs and build upon aging infrastructure to keep “the best and brightest” in Jackson. 
“Our HBCUs serve a vital role and they ought to be supported significantly,” Horhn told Mississippi Today. “I’m all for getting as much resources to all the HBCUs as possible. This includes getting the right person to head Jackson State.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/27124406/JSU-President-search-listening-session-4.jpg,,,2025-10-31 06:16:53.172274

(Photo provided)Charles Edward Whaley, who died Oct. 30, was a journalist who possessed a curiosity that carried him far beyond the borders of the commonwealth yet never lost sight of his roots. 
Over the course of a seven-decade career, Whaley’s work as a reporter, editor and critic at The Courier-Journal helped define the broad intellectual tone of Louisville journalism, particularly in its coverage of education and the arts. At age 97, he is believed to have been the oldest surviving staff member of the Bingham era at the Louisville newspapers.
Whaley was born on February 29, 1928 — a leap-year child — in Williamstown, in Grant County. He was valedictorian at Williamstown High School and served as drum major of the marching band.
He entered the University of Kentucky in 1945 on a journalism scholarship and by his senior year had been elected editor of The Kentuckian yearbook, tapped for Phi Beta Kappa, and named recipient of the Sullivan Medallion as the university’s outstanding male senior student. 
He served in the U. S. Army’s public information unit during the Korean War and then earned an MA in journalism at Columbia University. As a member of the 1954 inaugural class of Marshall Scholars he studied at the University of Manchester in England.
Whaley joined The Courier-Journal in 1950, as Louisville journalism entered a golden age. Whaley quickly distinguished himself as a writer of breadth and taste, writing at the intersection where ideas, policy, and art meet.
Whaley chronicled the evolution of Kentucky’s schools through the era of desegregation, consolidation, and reform through policy debates in Frankfort and the human stories unfolding in classrooms.
He was a regular reviewer for the paper’s book page of novels, biographies, histories and the occasional work of poetry. He contributed theatre criticism as well, combining his knowledge of literature with a lifelong affection for the stage.
In 1957, Whaley married Carol Sutton, a University of Missouri journalism graduate and city reporter. In 1974, Sutton was named managing editor of The Courier-Journal, the first woman in America to lead a major American newspaper. In 1976, she was featured on the cover of Time magazine as a “Woman of the Year.” She died in 1985. Their daughters, Carrie Whaley Orman and Kate Whaley Archer, survive him.
Charles Whaley’s years in England left a permanent imprint and he made regular return visits, maintaining friendships with journalists and scholars and assembling an enviable book collection. On both sides of the Atlantic, he was considered an expert on Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury circle.
As a rural Kentuckian and reporter who bridged education and the arts, and as a critic who reminded his readers that ideas matter, Charles Whaley’s creed remained constant: clarity, fairness, curiosity.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Charles-Watley-e1761848646589-1024x599.jpg,,,2025-10-31 05:57:37.503677

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)A divided Arkansas Supreme Court said Thursday that two state laws related to ballot petitions violate the constitution, in a case involving a paper-ballot measure from Cleburne County.
In the 4-3 decision, Justice Shawn Womack, writing for the majority, said a circuit judge erred in ordering County Clerk Rachelle Evans to certify an initiative petition for voters to consider because the petition was untimely filed under Article 5, Section 1 of the Arkansas Constitution. The Supreme Court opinion reversed and dismissed the lower court’s order.
In deciding the case, the Supreme Court majority declared unconstitutional two state laws governing the time frame during which county-level ballot measures can be filed because they conflict with the filing window established in Article 5, Section 1. That section says initiative petitions in cities and counties must be filed no earlier than 90 days and no later than 60 days before an election.
Declaring the laws unconstitutional meant that the justices also overruled three previous state high court decisions.
In a dissenting opinion Justice Rhonda Wood wrote that the majority raised legal issues not present in the original appeal or the circuit court record and “leaps over settled law to reach its decision.”

 Case background

The case stems from the Cleburne County clerk’s rejection last year of a ballot initiative asking voters to approve an ordinance requiring elections be held using hand-marked, hand-counted paper ballots. 
A group called Arkansas Voter Integrity Initiative has pushed for a switch from electronic voting machines to paper ballots in several counties since at least 2022. In 2023, Cleburne County Quorum Court approved a resolution to convert to paper ballots but later reversed itself. Searcy County is the only county so far to require hand-counted paper ballots.

Last year, identical petitions calling for countywide votes on switching to paper ballots were filed in nine counties, including Cleburne. Clerks of those counties rejected the ballot initiatives, and attorney Clinton Lancaster sued on behalf of supporters over the rejections.
Circuit judges dismissed the lawsuits in Conway, Johnson, Perry, Saline, Sharp, White and Van Buren counties, but judges in Cleburne and Independence counties ordered those clerks to certify the initiative petitions for placement on the November 2024 ballot. Those clerks appealed to the Arkansas Supreme Court.
The Independence County clerk asked for an expedited hearing, and on Oct. 17, 2024, the high court affirmed the circuit court order directing the clerk to certify the measure as sufficient. The initiative appeared on the November ballot, and voters approved the ordinance 8,309 to 5,184.
Cleburne County Clerk Rachelle Evans did not ask for an expedited hearing on her appeal. The Supreme Court began requesting briefs from the parties last November. After hearing oral arguments in May, the justices asked for supplemental briefs focused on the issue of timeliness.

 ‘Clear and unmistakable conflict’

Arkansas Code Annotated 14-14-915(b)(1) says all petitions for initiated county measures “shall be filed with the county clerk” not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the next regular election. That timeline is in “clear and unmistakable conflict” with Article 5, Section 1 and is therefore unconstitutional, Womack wrote.
Similarly ACA 14-14-915(b)(3) is unconstitutional, the justice wrote, because it allows a ballot initiative that is certified by county election commissioners less than 70 days before a general election to be held over for a vote at the next general election. In the Cleburne County case, this would have meant the petition being on the 2026 ballot.
“Put simply, when the proponent of a local ballot initiative fails to timely file his petition, a circuit court cannot require a county clerk to certify the initiative for that election,” Womack wrote. “Nor can the circuit court ‘delay’ the certification ‘until the following regular election’ if the initiative has not been filed” within the constitution’s timeline. 
“Because of this, we expressly overrule Armstrong v. Sturch, Fine v. City of Van Buren,and Robie v. Bolton, all of which misinterpreted a nearly identical but now-repealed constitutional provision,” the ruling states.
Womack was joined in the majority opinion by Justices Cody Hiland, Barbara Webb and Nicholas Bronni.
Wood’s dissenting opinion, concurred in by Justice Courtney Rae Hudson and Chief Justice Karen Baker, says the majority’s conclusion on the constitutionality of the two laws and the timeliness of the ballot initiative filing “rests on its own factual finding” that the petition had to be filed on or before Aug. 5, 2024 “— an assertion on which the record is silent.”
Citing the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s position that appellate courts are arbiters of legal questions, not “self-directed boards of legal inquiry,” Wood wrote that the majority “departs from neutrally arbitrating the issues argued by the parties and instead becomes investigator and inquisitor.”
In rebuttal, Womack wrote: “The dissent does not claim that the record does not support our holding. Instead, the dissent laments the fact that we noticed obvious problems with the underlying petition.” The record clearly indicates that initiative supporter Raymond Harrison failed to timely file the petition, the majority noted. To ignore “such a glaring constitutional violation…would be a dereliction of our duty.”
The dissenting opinion also takes issue with the high court’s failure to alert the attorney general and the Legislature to the constitutional issues of the case.

(Photo by Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg)Farmers nationwide often use biosolids — human waste that has been treated by wastewater facilities — as a cheaper, readily available fertilizer option for their soils. But there is a rising concern of PFAS, better known as forever chemicals, being spread on farmland through this waste. Virginia currently does not test biosolids for PFAS – and one county wants it done before they approve more permits.
“The (Orange County Board of Supervisors) understands that PFAS chemicals, even at extremely low levels, can cause significant harm to human health, including various types of cancers and developmental harm to infants and children,” Chairman R. Mark Johnson wrote to the Department of Environmental Quality earlier this month.
In Orange County, community members have been educating their neighbors about the dangers of PFAS in these biosolids and have urged the board to be wary of awarding new permits or renewing old ones before proper testing is done. A recent public hearing on reissuing a permit to apply biosolids on farmland drew dozens of concerned community members to speak against it.
PFAS, or Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances, are chemicals used in many products worldwide such as shampoo, clothing, paint, and non-stick cookware. They end up in wastewater and the leftover biosolids. When the biosolids are used as fertilizer, those chemicals then can leech into crops, soil and waterways.
Virginia does have requirements for biosolid use on farmland to be set back from wells and homes. However the state does not test its biosolids for PFAS so Orange County leaders are asking DEQ to look into how the chemicals may show up in a project proposed by a company that transforms waste into resources.
Synagro manages biosolid storage in Virginia as well as biosolid applications in various counties. The company recently proposed an application for 2,500 acres in Orange County; some of the land is near Pamunkey Creek. The chairman’s letter said there have already been PFAS noted in the creek. The letter goes on to say that the board is not against the use of biosolids for fertilizer, however they want to ensure farmers are aware of potential contaminants. 
The letter calls on DEQ to test Synagro biosolids for PFAS, for the test results to be publicly shared, and for state regulators to prohibit any biosolids that do contain PFAS from being used in the county.
“Given the irreversible nature of PFAS contamination and the growing evidence of its harmful effects, we believe these conditions represent the minimum necessary protections for Orange County’s residents, farmland, animals, farmers, water resources to include drinking water and the environment overall,” Johnson’s letter said.
The board asks DEQ to deny the permit renewal if their requests cannot be met.
“Our farmers deserve to know what they’re putting on their land, and our citizens deserve protection from forever chemicals.”
The public is invited to share their thoughts on Synagro’s proposal with DEQ’s Blue Ridge regional office through Nov. 7.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)What state Democratic legislators are doing to alter redistricting of Virginia’s seats in Congress is wrong. And totally understandable – especially when it comes to politics. 
They’ve convened a surprise special session in Richmond right before the fall elections for statewide offices. They want to counter President Donald Trump’s successful exhortations to Republican-controlled states to undertake rare, mid-decade modifications to current congressional maps. 
In that way, Trump has hijacked what had been a state prerogative. He corrupts much of what he touches.
Democratic lawmakers here and nationwide got fed up. They’re tired of being punching bags, expecting Republicans to adhere to long-established laws, norms and customs dictating how the political process operates. Trump and his sycophants have bulldozed those guidelines.
This newly combative stance will bolster Democrats with their followers and reframe Republicans’ dismissive attitude toward them. Here in Virginia, though, it could also backfire when Republicans eventually regain control of the state House and Senate in our purple commonwealth. 
“I think Democrats are looking at these nonpartisan and bipartisan redistricting efforts in blue states, and Republicans doing redistricting not once but twice, and looking at (this as) unilateral disarmament,” Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington, told me this week.
“In many ways, the Virginia Democratic Caucus has shown national Democrats how to behave,” Farnsworth added. He cited, for example, when legislative Democrats rejected Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s expensive proposed stadium deal last year: “They created a compelling alternative narrative that it wasn’t a good use of state funds.”
People or profits: arena drama reflects a familiar struggle

Trump knows there will be an electoral backlash in 2026 in the narrowly divided U.S. House of Representatives because of his ruthless domestic agenda. His blueprint gutted the social safety net for millions of Americans. The Darwin-like policies will be hugely unpopular – even in red states – when the full consequences take effect.
That’s why Trump demanded that Texas, North Carolina and other states redraw district lines to benefit him and give Republicans an advantage.
Several states obeyed. Others are considering it. California, a reliably blue state, has responded by trying to boost Democratic seats, but changes must be approved by voters there in a referendum next week.
And so on.
Virginia Democrats, who narrowly control both chambers in the General Assembly, are spitting in the eye of the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission. It was created when voters overwhelmingly passed it in a 2020 referendum, after years of debate.
True, the citizen-legislative body often deadlocked in 2021, after the most recent census. But the new process was more transparent and prevented the majority party (Democrats that year) from steamrolling the minority. The state Supreme Court eventually oversaw the process of line-drawing.
Lots of procedural and legal hurdles remain to the Democrats’ current gambit to rewrite lines before the 2026 congressional contests. Among them: Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican who’s running for re-election, has opined that the process to amend the state Constitution “cannot be short-circuited by a last-minute vote of the General Assembly taken during an ongoing election.” 
Brian Cannon is past executive director of OneVirginia2021, which was among the main proponents for creating a bipartisan redistricting commission. He opposes the current machinations in the General Assembly.
“What are we willing to destroy to save the Republic?” Cannon asked. “ … I think this is wrong.”
He noted that if Democrats want to win specific contests in 2026 in the U.S. House of Representatives, upending the redistricting commission isn’t necessary. They should run better candidates, he said. 
If only it were that simple.
The redistricting process is no longer just a state issue. It’s become nationalized under Trump, who wants no guardrails on his autocratic tendencies. 
Also, because of the narrow party margins in the U.S. House and Senate, every contest is scrutinized. Local races carry national significance.
This is the political climate that Democrats in Virginia face. Redistricting battles in states that are at least nominally controlled by their party are among the few ways they can fight back.
Plus, they’re tired of being rolled. They can point to several examples over the past decade of partisan bad faith and rejection of established procedures. They include major flashpoints:

 In early 2016, President Barack Obama’s last full year in office, he nominated Merrick Garland to a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court following the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, refused to hold confirmation hearings, claiming the next president should nominate the next justice. It was a standard made up of thin air.
In eerily similar circumstances in late 2020, McConnell rushed to hold hearings following the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The difference? Then-President Donald Trump would nominate Amy Coney Barrett. She was confirmed just days before that year’s presidential election. The move cemented a conservative majority on the high court.
 Trump incited the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol following his lies about the election he lost to Joe Biden. Several people died. Roughly 150 police officers who defended the Capitol – and congresspeople there in danger from the mob – were wounded. Yet, the majority of Republican senators voted not to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. They protected a man who threatened their own lives that day.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to swear in Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat, who won a special election Sept. 23 in Arizona. He’s stalling, Democrats allege, because she’d be the 218th signature on a petition to force the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, which Trump opposes. Even though Congress is shut down over budget disputes, Johnson can swear in new members during “pro forma” sessions when the House isn’t in session – as he did earlier this year with two Republicans, Axios reported. 

None of this makes what Democrats are doing in Richmond right. They and their colleagues nationwide, though, are sick of being taken for chumps.
I suspect many Virginians applaud their combativeness.

But that figure has skyrocketed as the price of groceries has pinched more and more families.
Now, the small food pantry serves about 450 families a month in this community of about 8,500 people. Serving that growing number has become increasingly difficult with the high cost of food, cuts in federal aid — and an unprecedented disruption in the nation’s largest food assistance program looming.
Chris Mitchell, who leads the nonprofit that operates the Independence Food Basket and provides other services, said the amount the organization spends on food to supplement donated items increased from $1,700 per month in 2018 to $4,000 per month now.
“And that’s getting it from the food bank without taxes,” he said.
Like other providers across the country, the Independence Food Basket is bracing for a spike in demand when an estimated 42 million people are expected to lose access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP. Monthly benefits will not be provided beginning Saturday because of the ongoing federal government shutdown.
The unparalleled stress of a SNAP disruption on food pantries and the food banks that collect, warehouse and distribute food comes at a time when they were already stretched thin. High grocery prices have pushed more Americans to look to food banks for help. But organizations providing food relief have lost more than $1 billion in federal aid and are bracing for the impacts of legislation that will permanently limit the reach of SNAP.
Food banks now are asking local governments and donors to step in as they prepare for long lines. Many operations have increased orders ahead of the expected SNAP chaos, though some food pantries say they may have to ration food if supplies dwindle too quickly.
“You’d have to be living under a rock somewhere to not know that the prices of groceries went up and stayed up,” Mitchell said. “Now, you’re going to take away the means that people in poverty can afford food.”

The rising price of food has driven up not just visits to pantries, but also costs for the charitable food system in recent years.
Social service providers also are bracing for the impact of permanent changes to food stamps and other social services enacted in President Donald Trump’s major tax and spending law signed in July. The first in a wave of cutbacks to SNAP ended exemptions from work requirements for older adults, homeless people, veterans and some rural residents, likely pushing millions out of the food stamp program.
The administration also has pulled direct aid to food banks.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture in March nixed more than $1 billion from two programs that helped food banks and school meal programs buy local foods including fruits, vegetables and proteins.
Also this spring, the administration abruptly cut $500 million from a program that sends domestically produced meat, dairy, eggs and produce to food banks. The items that were delivered through The Emergency Food Assistance Program were some of the healthiest, most expensive items organizations distribute, ProPublica reported.
In Missouri alone, that move canceled 124 scheduled deliveries to food banks, including 146,400 pounds of cheese, 433,070 pounds of canned and frozen chicken and 1.2 million eggs.
“Food banks have been operating on fumes since the pandemic,” said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center, a national nonprofit working to address poverty-related hunger. “As much as we love the food banks and the superhero work that they’re doing, they can only do so much.”
Already rising demand
Plata-Nino said food banks and food pantries were intended as emergency food aid, but have become “a way of life” for many who struggle to afford groceries.
A disruption in SNAP benefits will cause millions to make impossible decisions about how to stretch their limited dollars, Plata-Nino said. She noted that the majority of SNAP recipients make less than $1,100 per month. (The liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates the average SNAP benefit this fiscal year is about $188 per month per person.)
Local leaders rush to help, but can’t fill massive SNAP void

“People are already making really difficult choices,” she said, “and I hate to call it a choice, because it’s not a choice when you don’t have one.”
In Texas, the San Antonio Food Bank has been responding to a surge in need from furloughed federal workers. With major Defense Department operations across the area, San Antonio is home to the largest number of federal employees in Texas.
Eric Cooper, the food bank’s president and chief executive officer, estimates it will serve about 50,000 more people who have gone without paychecks this month. Each year, the food bank serves about 577,000 people across 29 counties.
He recalled one furloughed U.S. Social Security Administration employee who recently visited for the first time. Though she weathered previous shutdowns, she now takes care of her grandchildren.
“She’s like, ‘Hey, I showed up to get food because I don’t know if I’m going to get paid, and I can’t let my grandbabies go hungry,’” Cooper said.
Given the disruption to SNAP, Cooper said the food bank has been gearing up to not only increase inventory but also manage limited supplies and heightened emotions among the public.
“Should the demand start to outpace our supply, we will start to ration,” he said. “Rather than giving a week’s worth of food or two weeks’ worth of food, we’re going to be giving less.”
Generally, the need for free food spikes during times of natural disasters or recessions, said Michelle Ness, executive director of PRISM, a nonprofit providing housing and food assistance in suburban Minneapolis.










Right now, food shelves are at just about the max capacity we can handle.


– Michelle Ness, executive director of PRISM


But Minnesota food shelves, known as food pantries in other parts of the country, have seen a 150% increase in visits since the pandemic, she said.
“This is during nonemergency times, nondisaster times — needs are going way up,” she said. “Right now, food shelves are at just about the max capacity we can handle.”
To meet the projected increase in demand because of the SNAP disruption, Ness said her organization’s food shelf is considering launching a sort of express lane that would allow people to quickly pick up prepackaged boxes of food. She hopes donors will increase their giving to avoid rationing food.
“If anything, I would like to be able to give out more food, because people will have greater needs without getting SNAP benefits,” she said. “That’s a lot of food that they’re not going to have to fill their refrigerator and cupboards.”
A daily necessity
While nonprofits happily take donated food items, much of the stock is purchased. And that doesn’t come cheap — even with discounts for purchasing foods in bulk from nonprofit food banks.
The Food Group, a Minneapolis food bank that supplies PRISM and other operators, has had to raise its prices and cut back on certain expensive items — including eggs, said Executive Director Sophia Lenarz-Coy.
In the past year, The Food Group has raised its wholesale prices of spaghetti by 26%. Jasmine rice has gone up 6%, and dry potatoes have increased 11%. Between 2022 and 2025, a case of frozen ground beef has increased from just under $50 to $63.08 — a 28% spike. Cases of margarine have risen 39% over that time, and diced tomatoes have gone up 23%.
Veterans, rural residents, older adults may lose food stamps due to Trump work requirements

“I think it’s really hard to overstate just how grocery prices have changed in the last three years,” said Lenarz-Coy.
While higher earners can make adjustments in their monthly budgets, she noted that food is often the only flexible item in lower-income household budgets.
“Housing costs, how much you need to pay for transportation or medical costs or day care — those are all fixed costs,” she said. “The place where people can flex is on food, but those flexes just don’t get you as much as they used to.”
Back in southeast Kansas, Mitchell, of the Community Access Center, has come to appreciate the urgency of hunger.
Mitchell previously worked in homeless services. Oftentimes, people can get by temporarily staying with friends and families, but food is a constant, daily need, he noted.
“It’s like going without liquid,” he said. “You just don’t last very long without it. And that’s probably what hurts me the most about this cutoff.”
The looming SNAP disruption has him bracing for panic among those who rely on the pantry.
The per capita annual income in Independence is just under $30,000, and about a quarter of all children live in poverty, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.
To meet surging demand, Mitchell is considering further limiting the pantry’s already rationed offerings, whether families have one person or six in the household.
“That kills my heart,” he said. “But that’s so everybody gets some. … I’ve got this many people, and I’ve got to make sure that I can put something in each hand.”
Located inside a beige cinderblock building, the one-room food pantry is set up like a grocery store, with freezers for meats, refrigerators for fresh veggies and shopping carts for browsing.
Mitchell is proud to offer that kind of choice for people, which makes the process more dignified and reduces the likelihood that food goes to waste.
But a rush of visits next week — and concerns about hoarding and public safety — may force the nonprofit to reinstate its pandemic-era practice of handing out prepackaged boxes outdoors.
“It feels like going backwards,” Mitchell said.

Whether that helps Arkansas farmers already hurt by China’s previous boycott of soybeans remains to be seen. […],"A combine harvests soybeans in Phillips County, Arkansas, in this undated photo. (Photo by Robert Goodson/U of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture)Editor’s Note: China agreed on Thursday to buy 12 million tons of U.S. soybeans this season as part of a trade deal in which President Donald Trump pulled back on his threats of 100% tariffs on the country. Whether that helps Arkansas farmers already hurt by China’s previous boycott of soybeans remains to be seen.
One of Gov. Sarah Sanders’ Cabinet secretaries pulled out his blame shifter when questioned recently about the crisis facing Arkansas agriculture: Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson told legislators that farmers “are struggling not because of ordinary business cycles. They are struggling because of predatory behavior by China.”
But branding China as “predatory” for its decision to stop buying Arkansas soybeans ignores two salient facts: First, the autocrats in Beijing didn’t just wake up one day and arbitrarily decide that an embargo might be fun. They were defending themselves in a trade war they didn’t start. And second, shipments of soybeans would be winging their way to China right now were it not for Donald Trump and his tariff fetish.
Many of those soybeans are grown in the district of U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Jonesboro, who earlier this month introduced a bill to temporarily boost payments to beleaguered farmers to give them “some space to make it to the next year.” But the news release he sent announcing the bill didn’t mention Trump’s tariffs.
Likewise, U.S. Sen. John Boozman, who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee, posted a column in September in which he called for action to mitigate “dire circumstances brought on by increased input costs, high interest rates, depressed commodity prices and severe weather events.” Tariffs were conspicuously absent from his list.
And in an interview last week with the Arkansas Farm Bureau, U.S. Rep. French Hill, R-Little Rock, bemoaned what he called “the worst farm conditions I’ve seen in my business career.” His only mention of the “t” word came when he suggested tariff revenue might be used to bail out farmers — from damage aggravated by those same tariffs.
The degree to which Arkansas Republicans are prepared to downplay, ignore or excuse the effects Trump’s tariffs are having on farmers would be comical — if agriculture were not our state’s largest industry and the linchpin of its rural economy.
Indeed, the Sanders administration and Arkansas’ members of Congress — out of fear, fealty or a combination of both — are willingly acquiescing in a policy that actively harms their own constituents, including farmers who are part of their political base.
If a Democratic president were pursuing a tariff policy that was having such deleterious effects on our farmers, Arkansas Republicans would be screaming bloody murder, instead of trying to change the subject.
It’s true that the crisis facing Arkansas farmers isn’t caused by tariffs alone, as a recent report on the state of the farm economy by the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture makes clear. Inflation has pushed up production costs, and higher interest rates have battered an economic sector highly reliant on credit. Weak prices for soybeans, corn, rice and cotton are projected to drive down overall cash crop receipts by $465 million this year.
But tariffs are clearly adding another layer of misery on top of the problems farmers were already facing, a point Hudson unintentionally reinforced in singling out China’s reaction as the driving force behind the farm crisis.
Not only have tariffs curtailed export markets, increasing the agricultural trade deficit to a staggering $47 billion, they’ve also increased prices for fertilizer and farm machinery, cutting further into farmers’ profit margins.
And unlike intractable problems like interest rates or commodity prices, tariffs are much easier to fix. Trump could stop them the same way he started them, with a social media post.
Let’s presume for the sake of argument that Republicans in Arkansas’ congressional delegation actually have any influence over Trump’s behavior or White House policy. Principled pushback against tariffs, in defense of our farmers, might be more useful than trying to pretend that tariffs aren’t part of the problem. But that would take political courage, which seems to be in exceedingly short supply.
And another seemingly unrelated Republican policy is about to cause even more financial harm to farmers — the decision to end subsidies for Obamacare individual marketplace plans, which could trigger double- or even triple-digit percentage increases in premiums.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 27% of farmers and ranchers, many of whom are self-employed,  get coverage through Obamacare exchanges. So at the same time their profit margins are being squeezed by tariffs, inflation, interest rates and weak prices, they’re also facing potentially unsustainable increases in the cost of their health care.
The battle over Obamacare subsidies is also what’s keeping the government closed, as Democrats refuse to pass a stopgap spending bill unless the subsidies are extended. And while the government is closed, Congress can’t consider any legislation to mitigate the financial armageddon looming for many farmers.
The crisis facing farmers in 2025 is déjà vu all over again. Trump’s first administration spent $28 billion on payments to agricultural producers to undo the damage to markets caused by a tariff policy that was less aggressive and slightly more rational than the present regime. That’s more money than we spent on the space program or our nuclear arsenal.
Congress will no doubt open up the piggy bank again once it goes back to work. But that may not be soon enough for farmers making decisions now about whether they can continue into next year’s planting season.
There’s also a broader philosophical question here: Wouldn’t farmers rather make money by growing and selling their products in markets unfettered by tariffs, rather than suckling at the government’s teat? And isn’t a policy that fosters more dependence on government handouts the very antithesis of conservatism?
Meanwhile, China is doing fine without Arkansas soybeans, which they’re now buying from Argentina and Brazil. Donald Trump continues to make trade policy by whim on his cell phone in the middle of the night, apparently oblivious to the damage he’s doing.
And Arkansas Republicans enable Trump by refusing to acknowledge how he’s making life more difficult for the farmers and farm communities they’re supposed to represent.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/philiips-soybeans_15189035271_o.jpg,,,2025-10-31 05:16:31.917591

Clinics across Ohio are already strapped for funding with a federal budget reconciliation bill that took away Medicaid and other funding, but now the state is trying to end their connection as well.
The state Medicaid department cited the federal budget reconciliation law, signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, as reasoning for the termination, in a Sept. 24 letter received by Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region and Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.
“The provisions of the federally mandated 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act prohibit certain nonprofit health care providers from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursement for services,” said Stephanie O’Grady, spokesperson for the ODM, in a statement to the Capital Journal.
“We are complying with the law set forth by Congress and will continue to work with other qualified Medicaid providers across the state to ensure that members have access to essential services.”
Planned Parenthood clinics have used the Medicaid funds to provide services like preventive care, STD screenings, and other general practice health services.
Federal and state Medicaid funds already can’t be used for abortion services, and clinics around the state have said they have never used the funds for those services.
But termination from the state’s Medicaid program will impact non-abortion services for more than 27,000 patients who went to Planned Parenthoods in Southwest Ohio and the Greater Ohio affiliate’s regions.
Patients without eligible private insurance will have to pay out of pocket or find another provider if the termination goes forward.
The termination notification comes alongside federal funding cuts by the Trump administration, which the national Planned Parenthood headquarters is fighting through a lawsuit.
Typically, removal from the Ohio Department of Medicaid programs comes for a particular reason, such as conviction of a crime or behavior that goes against the regulations of Medicaid, according to Melissa Cohen, general counsel for the Planned Parenthoods of Greater Ohio and Southwest Ohio Region.
“We’re not in that boat, Planned Parenthood has followed all laws and regulations,” Cohen told the Capital Journal.
“This is really an unprecedented situation for a provider to be terminated in this way.”

That’s why the clinics have started the process of requesting an administrative hearing with the department, asking for justification for the termination, and confirmation that no official misconduct has been noted in the termination proposal, according to Cohen.
The state action has “more problematic effects,” Cohen said, given that Planned Parenthood affiliates see this as a “political attack” and not one related to the care they provide.
“This back and forth (on funding) is really confusing for patients and stressful for patients,” Cohen said.
The confusion may continue, even though the termination would be put on hold as the proceedings for an administrative hearing are organized.
Cohen said while the process of administrative review goes on, things will stay as they are for Planned Parenthoods in the state.
After an administrative decision is made, parties have the ability to appeal to a state court if they disagree with the decision as well, holding off any further action until that process is undertaken.
Meanwhile the federal case through which the national Planned Parenthood Federation of America hopes to claw back funds eliminated as a part of the budget process is still ongoing as well.
An injunction that paused the funding cuts was undone by a federal judge, and the next court date is scheduled for Nov. 12.
It still could be quite some time before a final decision is released, especially if appeals are made to the U.S. Supreme Court should the decision go against the wishes of the Trump administration.
With the loss of federal funds continuing as the court case rolls on, Cohen said Ohio clinics have already seen patient numbers drop.
Patient navigators and social workers working with Ohio’s Planned Parenthoods are informing patients of the available services and referring patients to other providers for unavailable care.
The Southwest Ohio region’s Planned Parenthood closed two clinics earlier this year, citing the federal funding cuts as a catalyst for the decision.
Cohen said a timeline for the administrative hearing is unknown at this point.

Without the staff, more children cannot be enrolled. Here, the Growing Years child care center in Manchester. (Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)Earlier this month, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services announced new goals for increasing child care capacity. Some advocates, however, say they’re concerned that the state may be “putting the cart before the horse.”
DHHS Commissioner Lori Weaver said the department’s Roadmap 2025-2027 aims to set “priorities and initiatives” for the biennium — including one for a child care system struggling with workforce shortages, a lack of capacity in centers and programs, and high tuition prices.
The department published two goals to try to address those constraints. 
The first is to increase child care access and the capacity of child care providers by enrolling 10% more children from high-need communities by September 2026. 
In New Hampshire, there are fewer spaces available in child care centers and programs than families that want to access them. According to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, the state’s capacity to provide licensed care for children under age 5 dropped almost 13% between 2017 and 2023. Between 2019 and 2023, there was an average annual shortage of about 9,107 child care slots.   
The department intends to identify communities “in need of increased access to child care” and “implement a plan to increase the number of children enrolled in licensed slots.”
Shannon Tremblay, director of the New Hampshire Child Care Advisory Council, said that while the goal does tackle one of the issues of the crisis, capacity, it does not touch on the biggest issue: the lack of workforce. 
“I think the state’s vision is putting the cart before the horse a little bit. We’re just not there yet,” she said. “We have to worry about the workforce, making livable wages, getting people into the workforce, and then you are able to fill classrooms back up.”
By law, for safety and quality reasons, child care and early education programs are required to maintain certain child-to-provider ratios based on the child’s age. Without the staff, more children cannot be enrolled. 
The solution is not as simple as hiring more people. 
Early child care providers get paid nearly $9 an hour less than the average working Granite Stater — or $15.62 compared to $24.03, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. Coupled with the required certifications and credentials, constraints on tuition increases due to fears of pricing families out, and higher wages for similar jobs like pre-K or kindergarten teachers, it is hard for program owners to hire more providers. 
Through the second goal, DHHS hopes to work with stakeholders to “assess and quantify” the current funding landscape. 
Tuition for child care programs in New Hampshire is expensive. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that families spend less than 7% of their income on child care. According to Child Care Aware, a married couple in New Hampshire spends a median of 11.9% of their income on child care and a single parent spends 37.3%. 
Families must decide between paying for expensive child care or leaving the workforce to provide that care themselves. Last year, more than 17,000 Granite Staters were out of work because they were caring for a child not enrolled in school or a care program, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. They also estimated that between $9 million and $14.1 million in potential tax revenue across New Hampshire was lost in 2023 due to unavailable child care slots. 
While the state has programs like the Child Care Scholarship program to help subsidize costs, advocates say there is not enough state investment to stabilize the care system. 
“Most of our child care providers are on state subsidies themselves,” Tremblay said. “The state has done great things with increasing eligibility for child care scholarships and stuff like that. But even if you get a child care scholarship, you may not have that spot for child care. It’s just like the chicken and the egg kind of thing.” 
The state aims to assess funding through a fiscal analysis sponsored by the Early Care and Education Funders Collaborative.
According to Julie Asher, the executive director of the ECEFC, the analysis consists of two pieces: cost modeling and visioning. 
For cost modeling, Asher said the analysis will look at the money currently in the state’s child care funding system to identify its sources, where the state can get more, and where the barriers of access are in hopes of achieving a “sustainable, equitable, and high-quality” child care system and workforce. The visioning piece of the analysis will be a “collaborative” effort among early care and education stakeholders to try to find long-term solutions to the problem. 
Due to the state’s limited funding capabilities, Asher knows that the department and other stakeholders will have to “be creative” in crafting a vision for the future of high-quality care. 
In addition to child care, the roadmap outlines DHHS’ plans to invest in the department’s workforce, improve existing community health initiatives in areas like behavioral health and Medicaid, and enhance customer service for Long Term Care and Contract Lifecycle Management services.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/childcaredhhs-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-31 05:16:31.917591
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-31 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT lawmakers: Lamont must do more to replace vanishing food aid,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/31/ct-snap-funds-lamont-rainy-day-fund/,A bipartisan consensus is nudging Gov. Ned Lamont toward tapping Connecticut's rainy day fund to replace SNAP benefits.,"An unexpected bipartisan consensus that Gov. Ned Lamont’s initial response to the suspension of the SNAP federal food program is inadequate is nudging the governor toward tapping Connecticut’s massive rainy day fund for greater relief.
While Lamont has authorized a $3 million emergency grant to stock food pantries, other governors are offering greater relief programs, including $37.5 million a week in Virginia for SNAP recipients.
And with the General Assembly headed into special session in two weeks, a bipartisan legislature could impose terms.
Democrats and Republicans in the General Assembly “are willing to work together to try to provide critical supports for Connecticut residents in the coming weeks,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Thursday. “And we hope the governor will join us in that effort.”
“I think that it is dangerous for the state of Connecticut to take a wait-and-see approach, and we need to assume that this shutdown is going to on for a long period of time,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said, referring to the ongoing partial federal government shutdown that could stop federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP] grants to needy households nationwide starting Saturday.
Among those losing out are an estimated 360,000 Connecticut residents who collectively receive about $72 million in monthly SNAP benefits, according to the state Department of Social Services.
Attorney General William Tong joined three Democratic governors and 21 attorneys general from other states this week, suing in federal court in Boston to force President Trump’s administration to use contingency funds to maintain the SNAP program during the shutdown. A federal judge indicated Thursday that she would rule soon, the New York Times reported. But even a ruling that favors the plaintiffs might not get benefits flowing by Nov. 1.
Lawmakers: Lamont’s response to crisis pales against other states’
Lamont has limited his response to dedicating $3 million to Connecticut Foodshare, a nonprofit that distributes surplus groceries from the food industry to pantries, meal programs and other related services across the state.
The governor, a fiscal moderate, has traditionally objected to using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government, a stance that sometimes leaves him at odds with his fellow Democrats.
“Gov. Lamont has committed $3 million — that will not be reimbursed by the federal government — to provide food to our most vulnerable residents,” spokesman Rob Blanchard said. “This is a dynamic situation, and federal agencies have changed their guidance or provided unclear information throughout the shutdown. The administration remains hopeful that Congress and President Trump will recognize the need to act swiftly to fully fund the federal government.”
But leaders of key committees in the Democratic-controlled General Assembly this week, while praising the efforts of Connecticut Foodshare, pantries and similar programs statewide, said Lamont must do more than hope for the best, calling his $3 million emergency grant woefully inadequate.
Most SNAP households here already rely heavily on free or discounted food from pantries to supplement what they can purchase with an average monthly benefit of $324, said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. And many communities in poor, rural eastern Connecticut have few pantries, with very limited supplies.
Connecticut’s SNAP income limits equal 200% of the Federal Poverty Level for gross monthly income — $5,200 for a family of four — or 100% of the poverty level for net monthly income.
“They cannot solve the problem this big by themselves,” Osten added. “We should be meeting daily on this issue. … We cannot avoid feeding people.”
Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said one Hartford food pantry operator notified him this week that “her shelves were already bare. I don’t think that’s an isolated incident.”
Lesser’s fellow co-chair, Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, noted a growing number of states — most of which lack the wealth of Connecticut — already are tapping their coffers to help vulnerable citizens.
“I’m frustrated that we are in the final week of October and the Lamont administration hasn’t already laid out all of those options to the legislature,” Gilchrest said. “We’ve seen the writing on the wall.”
Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer directed his budget office to transfer state funds as needed to fully fund SNAP benefits through November, while Vermont Gov. Phil Scott announced state resources would keep benefits flowing at least through Nov. 15, VTDigger reported.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham committed $30 million in state funds, which would replace 30% of federal SNAP benefits lost during the first 10 days of November.
In Louisiana, Gov. Jeff Landry’s executive order opens the door for the state legislature to tap an emergency state fund to mitigate lost federal SNAP benefits.
Rhode Island and Hawaii will use the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which uses a combination of federal and state dollars to offset some of the SNAP funds for households with kids.
How quickly could CT offer state-funded SNAP benefits?
But Connecticut legislators particularly noted steps taken in Virginia, where Gov. Glenn Youngkin also announced state funds would keep SNAP benefits at full levels, at least through November, if the shutdown persists that long.
Lamont administration officials had said it would take about six months to get a state-funded SNAP benefit system up and running. But according to the website for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the SNAP program, Connecticut and Virginia both use the same SNAP debit card contractor: New Jersey-based Conduent Inc.
Why was Virginia able to solve this problem quickly, working with Conduent, but the Lamont administration says any fix will take months, Candelora asked.
“We cannot keep attempting to misdirect the conversation,” he added.
Blanchard said recent conversations with Conduent now have state officials convinced a state-funded benefit program could be established sooner than six months, though it’s not clear yet just how long it would take.
Blanchard added that the administration hasn’t limited its response to just assisting food pantries and continues to explore other initiatives.
“We’ve had constructive and encouraging conversations with legislative leaders and are exploring ways we can support SNAP beyond the $3 million, and we look forward to reaching an agreement,” he said.
Still, there are some risks if Connecticut moves too quickly.
Congress voted this summer to require states, starting in 2028, to cover a portion of SNAP benefit costs regularly if they too often issue incorrect amounts or serve ineligible households, based on 2025 and 2026 program operations.
In other words, if Connecticut throws together an emergency state-funded SNAP program hastily, could it worsen state error rates that already exceed federal thresholds?
One month of food benefits would cost a fraction of CT’s billions
Regardless of that risk, though, advocates for a more aggressive response say Connecticut arguably has more resources to respond than any other state.
The emergency budget reserve, commonly known as the rainy day fund, holds $4.3 billion or 18% of the General Fund, one of the larger state reserves in the nation.
Connecticut closed the 2024-25 fiscal year last June 30 with a $2.5 billion surplus, the second-largest in state history. And while most of that windfall is earmarked to whittle down Connecticut’s $35 billion pension debt, legislative leaders have talked about using $400 million to $500 million to mitigate painful federal budget cuts not only to nutrition assistance but also to winter heating aid, health and other programs.
On top of all that, Lamont’s budget office projects another huge surplus, almost $1.8 billion, for this fiscal year.
Spending $72 million of state funds in November to fully fund SNAP benefits would reflect just 4% of that projected surplus, or 1% of the projected surplus and rainy day fund combined.
“This 11th-hour scramble only intensifies the need for the legislature to form a federal response fund from the billions in state surplus and create fiscal policies that allow for the flexibility to defend Connecticut,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All. “Our elected officials need to start being proactive against federal attacks.”
Though a Democrat, the governor often can use the legislature’s Republican minority, which shares many of his fiscal views, as a shield against his fellow Democrats.
But GOP lawmakers have joined Democrats in saying Connecticut is sitting on too much money to let people go hungry.
“The governor or the legislature has the capability to use the rainy day fund when there is a serious situation, such as what is at hand for SNAP benefits,” Sen. Jeff Gordon, a Republican from the state’s northeastern corner in Woodstock, wrote in a statement this week.
Social service advocates also have been stepping up the pressure.
Three affiliated legal services nonprofits, which help low-income clients access human services, housing, education, employment and other programs, spearheaded a push even before the federal shutdown began Oct. 1 for a multi-tiered state response.
“Connecticut’s food insecure households are facing a perfect storm of crises as we head into November, a month associated with food and giving thanks,” said Sara Parker McKernan, a legislative and policy advocate for New Haven Legal Assistance Association.
The New Haven group, along with Greater Hartford Legal Aid and Connecticut Legal Services, urged Lamont and legislative leaders in September to develop a state-funded benefit system. This would protect the entire SNAP population in the event of a government shutdown. But it also could be used, legal services groups wrote, to assist about 40,000 Connecticut SNAP recipients would lose their benefits long-term starting next week.
Congress in July removed SNAP benefits for certain groups of immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness who no longer meet new stricter work requirements.
“We need our state leadership to cover the loss of nutrition assistance at least through the remainder of the year,” or until Congress resolves the budget issues that caused the partial shutdown, added Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children, a New Haven-based policy group. “We cannot allow Washington, D.C., to dictate inaction here at home.”

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)The Senate Commerce Committee was split Thursday on its recommendation for a bill that would deregulate the energy-hungry practice of cryptocurrency mining statewide. After two tied votes — one to recommend passage and another to recommend killing the bill — the group ultimately voted, 4-2, to recommend the bill for interim study.
Senators said they had received an unusually high volume of comments from constituents relating to the bill since it was last discussed in the spring.
The bill, House Bill 639, forbids municipalities from creating restrictions, such as noise limits, that would apply specifically to crypto mining facilities. It also prevents state or local governments from applying any unique tax to digital currencies or transactions, and ensures individuals and businesses are allowed to engage in digital asset mining.
Additionally, under the bill as proposed, any crypto-related disputes would be heard in a blockchain dispute docket in the superior court. The governor would appoint a justice to preside over cases concerning blockchain, according to the legislation.
When the full Senate votes on the bill in the new year, it will mark the second time the body has considered the legislation, which passed the House last session but was sent to the Senate Commerce Committee for further study after senators failed to reach a consensus in May.
The bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Keith Ammon, a Republican and software developer from New Boston, said at the time the bill would prevent discrimination against the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries. The bill is similar to a policy authored by an industry group, the Satoshi Action Group, which promotes bitcoin use and digital asset mining in the U.S. and has seen its model legislation passed in multiple states.
However, as Republican District 9 Sen. Denise Ricciardi noted at the commerce committee Oct. 30, Arkansas — one such state — later took steps to increase regulations, with lawmakers citing noise complaints from residents who lived near mines as well as concerns about foreign mine ownership and environmental impact. Environmentalists, such as the New Hampshire Network, have raised concerns about the high energy and water needs of crypto mining facilities.
On Thursday, senators said their constituents had reacted strongly to the bill in the months since it last crossed the Senate floor.
“I don’t want to vote against it, but we heard from so many constituents, and I would like to have it worked on further and then move it forward next session,” Ricciardi said.
Sen. Tara Reardon, of Concord, said: “This is the single most emails I have ever received about one bill before, my constituents and statewide, with concerns about the details, loss of local control, what’s happening … in their towns.”
Sen. Keith Murphy, a Republican from Manchester, was among the bill’s supporters. He said the legislation would send a “strong message” that New Hampshire would be hospitable to the industry.
Ultimately, Ricciardi, Reardon, Sen. Tim McGough, and Sen. Donovan Fenton voted in favor of recommending the bill for interim study. Murphy and Sen. Dan Innis dissented.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bitcoinsenate-1024x589.jpg,,,2025-10-31 05:02:44.204773

(File photo from Getty Images.)Advocates on both sides stumbled momentarily Wednesday when the Ohio Supreme Court considered whether big increases in certain utility charges are legal.
At issue is whether the state’s regulator, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, acted legally in 2023 when it allowed Columbia Gas of Ohio to increase total fixed monthly charges from $36 a month to $58 a month by 2027 — a 50% increase. 
That’s money customers have to pay before they burn the first molecule of gas — regardless of how much or little they consume and how much hardware is needed to serve them. 
As it allowed the increase, the PUCO also allowed the elimination of energy-efficiency programs for non-low-income customers. 
Consumer groups sued, making several legal arguments, basically boiling down to the claim that in allowing the rate design, the PUCO failed to protect consumers.
Daniel Abrams represents the plaintiffs, the Energy Law and Policy Center and the Citizens Utility Board. 
On Wednesday, he told the justices that the PUCO allowed Columbia to abandon energy efficiency programs for most customers based on some dodgy math.

The efficiency programs provided rebates to install energy-efficient appliances, which Abrams said save everybody money by reducing peak demand and system costs. 
The program served 850,000 customers and saved more than $800 million, he said. 
But in its ruling, the PUCO said getting rid of the efficiency program would save ratepayers $120 million. 
“This point entirely ignores the benefits of the programs,” Abrams said. 
“Columbia itself touted its programs as award-winning, and demonstrated that these programs delivered $2.37 in benefit to the system for every $1 spent on them.”
Those savings don’t take into account the overall benefits of using less natural gas, which requires polluting processes such as fracking to obtain. And burning it is a major contributor to global warming.
Abrams also argued that by allowing Columbia to rely so heavily on fixed monthly charges, the PUCO was going against the original reason for allowing them. 
In 2008, it allowed fixed charges “to compensate Columbia for lost sales tied to energy conservation. 
In the order in this case, the commission eliminated the very energy-efficiency programs that justified the shift toward fixed charges in the first place.”
Since then, fixed charges have surged — from $12.16 in 2008 to $36.15 in 2021 to $58 in 2027 if the court allows the structure to stand. 
While fixed charges made up 20% of a customer’s bill in 2008, they will comprise 70% about 14 months from now, Abrams said.
Assistant Attorney General Jullian P. Johnson appeared on behalf of the PUCO. 
Early in his presentation, Justice Pat DeWine interrupted to ask how relying so heavily on fixed charges and abandoning a major efficiency program benefitted customers.
Johnson responded, in essence, that it did because it provided Columbia says it needs the money.
“It benefits customers because it provides Columbia with the necessary funding it needs to continue to provide safe and reliable service,” he said. 
“Columbia needs to have sufficient funding to continue providing…”
DeWine interrupted again.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“That’s the overall amount Columbia needs to collect. That’s kind of circular, right?” he said. 
“Part of this is moving toward higher fixed rates, right? That’s a philosophical change — how the rates are being done. Why does that benefit customers? Can you explain that”
Johnson repeated his earlier point.
“Well, it benefits customers because customers will not receive safe and reliable service unless Columbia has this,” he said.
Melissa Thompson, an attorney for Columbia Gas, said the new rate structure met the goal that “rates should be fair in apportioning costs.” 
She said that’s so “because customers’ bills reflected the actual usage of providing gas delivery rather than just the volume consumed.” 
Her argument seemed to ignore, however, that the fixed rates are applied regardless of the amount of infrastructure needed to supply gas. 
In other words, in 2027 you’ll pay $58 regardless of whether you live in an 8,000-square-foot mansion on a five-acre lot, or if you live in a 500-square-foot apartment in a crowded neighborhood with many customers paying for each mile of gas main.
Thompson also made a technical distinction. 
She said the only truly fixed cost in current bills is $3.76 a month. The rest of the fixed charges customers will have to pay are “riders” — charges to cover infrastructure improvements.
The riders were modified as part of the same proceeding that axed the energy-efficiency incentives for non-low-income customers. 
Columbia originally asked to increase the total of such costs to $80 a month by 2027.
DeWine seemed to trip up Abrams, the attorney for the groups challenging the rate arrangement.
“Is it true that most of those aren’t at issue because most of those are riders that already had been approved?” DeWine asked.
“I’m not sure,” Abrams said.
The Ohio Supreme Court will deliberate and then issue a ruling in the coming months.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)
Several key witnesses testified in Ohio’s trial against two of the state’s top pension leaders, who are accused in a civil lawsuit brought by the state of participating in a corruption scheme over investment of the multi-billion dollar fund.
“It’s the erosion of confidence in the institution that safeguards retirement security for Ohio’s teachers,” Assistant Attorney General Chad Kohler said.
The state is arguing that the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board chair, Rudy Fichtenbaum, should be removed from his position, and Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Karen Held Phipps should ban both him and former board member Wade Steen from ever returning to public pensions.
“There’s been no proof of any of the salacious accusations,” Norman Abood, attorney for Wade Steen, said.
In summary, the state is accusing Fichtenbaum and Steen of attempting to contract steer 70% of STRS assets to QED, a startup investment firm.
The AG’s office says QED’s leaders, Seth Metcalf and JD Tremmel, have “backdoor ties” and no track record, clients, or capability to invest the $65 billion they were seeking.
Former CIO Matt Worley was one of the first to raise concerns about the situation and their qualifications.
“They would fail miserably at all due diligence that had taken place,” Worley testified. “We also thought they were using their viewpoint about STRS and trying to scare trustees into coming to them for a solution.”
Worley made his feelings abundantly clear during a now-archived meeting we obtained via records request.
“We would not invest all $65 billion with one manager,” Matt Worley said, laughing during a November 2021 meeting. “That would be crazy.”
He said when denied, he believes QED, Fichtenbnaum, and Steen helped push a smear campaign against STRS and specific staff members.
“Personal attacks in campaigns, personal attacks on us as well,” Worley testified, adding that there was massive criticism on the investment returns that had never been there prior to the denial of QED. “Trying to poison the well.”
But the defense claimed that Worley was just trying to save his job, as the board was debating downsizing investment staff.
Staff continued to get bonuses while pensioners had their cost-of-living adjustments restricted.
“They were desperate for alternative suggestions as to, ‘How do we make enough money to pay COLA?'” Abood said.
Worley pointed out concerns that QED was getting too close to the board.
When Fichtenbaum took the stand, state attorney Martin Cordero pressed him about his messages with QED leaders, reading one of the messages out loud.
“The question we need to ask is, ‘Will this get us a six vote?’ What we really need to figure out is what can drive a wedge between the staff and board,” Cordero said, reading a message from Fichtenbaum to QED on the app Signal.
Before Attorney General Dave Yost sent out the subpoenas in this case, we made several records requests to the pension fund, asking for all communications between the board members and QED.
Screenshots from Fichtenbaum’s phone show that he used the encrypted app Signal to speak to the men. This app automatically deletes messages within a set time of the receiver reading them; however, the call logs don’t.
As of the time of our reporting in 2024, the AG’s team said they were learning about the use of Signal from the records request. Although we were unable to get the deleted messages, Signal will give up data if it is subpoenaed for the records.
The state said this breaches ethics and conflict of interest laws. Several state employees reached out to me to point out how Fichtenbaum responded to why he, a board member, would be presenting a company’s proposal and intellectual property as his own.
“We’re trying to explain their idea,” Fichtenbaum said.
He said there is nothing wrong with getting advice on proposals to get better returns for educators. The state says this went beyond just friendly guidance.
After Worley’s testimony, the defense moved for a directed verdict, basically a dismissal of the case in certain circumstances if there isn’t enough evidence or a legitimate basis for a jury to even consider an opposing party’s viewpoint.
Abood argued that the state didn’t prove any corruption or any reason why the men should be punished. Kohler, smirking at this assessment, argued that the case was clear-cut and they had clearly proven the men breached their fiduciary duties.
The judge sided with the state, denying the defense.
As it became later in the day, the defense called former board member Bob Stein to the stand to discuss how nothing corrupt happened with QED and that he didn’t trust the staff.
During the cross-examination, the judge was visibly shocked when Stein told the state that he believed board members could show favoritism to companies wanting to do business with STRS, didn’t think it was important to “foster public confidence in the integrity of the retirement system” because that was the “staff’s” job, and he didn’t care about avoiding the “appearance of impropriety,” because “appearance doesn’t matter.”

(Photo  by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Facing an absence of federal support, the Maine Legislature will consider several new proposals that would allow the state to step in to ensure Mainers receive food assistance and health care.
While these measures won’t be considered until lawmakers reconvene in January, the bill sponsors and legislative leaders say they can be used as contingency measures to address federal cuts as well as to possibly respond to ongoing complications from the government shutdown, which has now lasted a month with no end in sight.
When open enrollment for health insurance plans starts on Saturday, thousands of Mainers will see their premiums increase by hundreds of dollars. Congressional Democrats continue to hold out support for a stopgap spending bill unless the Republican majority commits to an extension of health care subsidies to alleviate those hikes. 
Also, roughly 170,000 Mainers are expected to lose federal food assistance because November funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, won’t be issued due to the shutdown. 
On Wednesday, Gov. Janet Mills announced the state is releasing $1.25 million in emergency funding to bolster food banks, Meals on Wheels and other anti-hunger programs across the state to help fill the gap. However, Mainers typically receive more than $20 million in monthly food assistance. 
Several Maine lawmakers said that while the state is undoubtedly trying to act as a backstop to federal cuts, that is not sustainable long-term. 
“It’s just ever mounting,” Speaker of the Maine House Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said in an interview. “Our state’s ability to respond, we will be responsive to the extent that we can provide some relief, but the harsh reality here in this situation is we’re not going to be able to solve every single problem.” 
Nevertheless, legislators have proposed several ways to try to alleviate federal fallout. 
The Legislative Council, composed of the ten elected members of legislative leadership, approved new legislation last week to be considered during the second regular session, during which lawmakers can only propose certain measures considered more timely or urgent.
Food assistance 
Several of the approved bills relate to food assistance, particularly to address cuts to SNAP made by the GOP spending bill passed in July. 
States will soon receive less federal funding to administer the program, an amount that will hinge on a figure known as the payment error rate: how much the state over or underpays recipients’ benefit amounts.
A proposal from Fecteau aims to reduce the state’s error rate. The specifics of the bill are still being worked out, Fecteau said, but he pointed to other states that have contracted with data companies to help them lower error rates. 
“People may get a 50 cent pay raise at work or $1 pay raise per hour at work and they don’t report it because we live busy lives,” Fecteau said, “and the first thing we think about when we get a pay raise isn’t, ‘Oh, I need to call DHHS and let them know that I got a pay raise because they need that for compliance with the federal government around my food assistance, even though I still totally qualify, they still need to record that data’.” 
Maine’s error rate is 10.26%, which is below the national average but still puts Maine at risk of potentially losing $50 million in federal funding. 
Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) proposed a bill to expand access to early childhood nutrition programs by including children in public pre-K classrooms that are located outside of school district buildings, which would make it so all public school students would be covered under Maine’s universal school meals commitment. 
“Maine faces one of the highest rates of childhood food insecurity in New England,” Daughtry said. “It doesn’t just mean empty stomachs, it means missed opportunities for growth and learning. It’s about brain development, our children’s future, and our responsibility to ensure that no child in Maine ever has to go hungry.”
Legislation from Rep. Bill Pluecker (I-Warren) seeks to ensure access to SNAP in Maine by making some technical adjustments to “take any vagueness out” and “ensure that it is crystal clear” that state law guarantees access to everyone with permanent residence in the state.
Another new bill from Pluecker would have the state collect food insecurity data that the U.S. Department of Agriculture used to gather as part of a longstanding federal survey it recently canceled. 
“This is an attempt to continue to do that at the state level, so we don’t lose access to those numbers,” he said, “and so we can chart our own progress in our effort to address hunger.”
A bill from Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York) similarly aims to plug a hole left by federal rollbacks by ensuring the state’s fund to address food insecurity and provide nutrition incentives can accept money from other sources beyond the federal government. 
“So if our federal government, like it’s doing now, is going to cut out on their obligation to this fund to address food insecurity because it’s SNAP related, we’re trying to make it more inclusive of other funding sources as well,” Ingwersen said. 
The state fund supports programs such as Harvest Bucks, which offers bonuses to low-income shoppers at participating farmers’ markets. 
Ingwersen also proposed a bill last session that is one of the hundreds of proposals being carried over into next year that seeks to increase the state’s annual allocations for that fund from $600,000 to $1.2 million per year. That bill was left in limbo awaiting funding at the end of the last session. 
Another related bill also awaiting funding is  a proposal to increase allocations for Mainers Feeding Mainers, an initiative of Good Shepherd Food Bank that helps farmers stock food pantries.  
Ingwersen led a letter from dozens of Democratic state legislators this week urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture to release contingency funds for SNAP during the shutdown. While he and others have proposed plans for the state to step in, Ingwersen said, “I don’t want to divert us from what the problem is — the problem is with the federal government.” 
Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey has also joined other state attorneys general in suing the Trump administration to try to force the release of the funds.
“We have to remember and be very clear this is a federal food program,” Ingwersen said of SNAP. “It’s been around since 1939. It’s like Social Security and Medicare — a federal responsibility paid for by us as federal taxpayers — and we expect this and we depend on this… We should be angry, and we should really keep our focus and hopefully we will, in the next week or so, the next few days, on the Trump administration to bring this money back.”
Health insurance 
The GOP spending bill also made significant cuts to health care, which other bills aim to help offset. 
Fecteau sponsored a bill that would create a contingency fund to allow the state to help Mainers as they lose access to health insurance. While Fecteau said he’s still hashing out the details of this plan, “that might involve moving some funding into a MaineCare stabilization federal response fund of some sort.” 
Two bills related to the soon-to-expire health subsidies that are the lynchpin of the federal shutdown were rejected by the majority of Legislative Council last week. However, Fecteau said he expects them to be appealed and for at least one to ultimately be accepted. 
Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln) and Sen. Kristi Michele Mathieson (D-Kittery) sponsored these bills that would permit some kind of state intervention to offset the expiration of the tax credits at the end of the year. 
Though, Fecteau said, “I’m sure [state legislation] will not ultimately be anywhere near what the federal government was capable of providing.”

Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook) with a title that indicates it seeks to lower insurance costs, reduce barriers to care and ensure fair prices was approved by Legislative Council, though Gattine did not respond to a request for comment and bill text is not available at this time.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1121-preview-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 05:02:44.204773

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)More than two years after the police raid on the Marion County Record, Kansans still grapple with what the action means. 
Was it a coordinated attack on free speech that reveals broad American attitudes about journalism and free speech? 
Was it an isolated, reckless act that we should shrug off so that the incident doesn’t intimidate reporters and editors? 
Was it a warning bell that roused Kansas journalists to be more ardent watchdogs for their communities?  
A recent article co-written by a professor at the University of Kansas works to bring new meaning to Aug. 11, 2023, the day that law enforcement executed search warrants that threatened the rural newspaper. One of the answers it provides: The raid caused “shared press distress.”  
Published in Journal of Communications Inquiry, the article “‘Shared Press Distress’ and the Police Raid on a Newspaper” was written by Nick Mathews of the University of Missouri and Stephen Wolgast, my colleague at the University of Kansas. 
Aside from summarizing basic facts of the raid, the article describes how the newspaper was victim to misguided allegations that pointed toward the need for a search warrant. 
“Five days after the raid, the county prosecutor withdrew the search warrants, citing insufficient evidence to link ‘this alleged crime and the places searched and the items seized,’” the article says. 
More significantly, Wolgast and Mathews detail how Kansas journalists reacted to the raid, and in doing so, they describe the human levers that operate inside journalists each day as we decide what to cover and how to cover it.
The article also makes clear how complicated the interchange of those levers can be in 2025, especially at rural Kansas outlets where journalists work in a climate of newspaper closures, declining revenue, staff cuts and political animosity. 
The word “trauma” — or a form of it — appears dozens of times, even more frequently than the paper’s references to “shared press distress.” To a significant degree, trauma unifies the article. 
 “While not as extreme, the police raid on the Kansas newspaper — and the death of its elderly co-owner the following day — serves as yet another reminder that trauma and journalism are often intertwined and highlights how traumatic experiences of one journalist can reverberate throughout the entire journalistic community,” Wolgast and Mathews write.
However, the article doesn’t quote journalists using the word “trauma” to describe their experiences. Instead, it divides the reactions of the 19 journalists from 16 new organizations into two broad categories: emotional and practical reactions. 
Kansas journalists said they felt shock, fear, defiance, unity and discomfort following the raid. 
One told the researchers, “I would say that we’re all a little more cognizant now of the reality that police actually could walk in the door and (seize) all of our stuff.”
Another said, “And you know what’s kind of chilling? It kind (of) made me sit back and think to myself, could that happen to us?”
The article also describes how the journalists acted during the months that followed the raid.  
“In the wake of the raid, the Kansas journalists balanced their raw emotions with realworld, practical concerns — revisiting their own reporting, reckoning with the financial strain of legal defense, and reevaluating their relationships with local law enforcement,” the article says.
Journalists admitted to the chilling nature of the raid, which caused them to feel more hesitant. 
The friction between the local law enforcement at the Marion County Record staff prompted Kansas journalists to reflect on their relationships with local officials and law enforcement, the study says. 
“You hate to say you’re going to temper your coverage, but maybe not put it all out there, kind of like we used to,” one journalist said. 
The raid in central Kansas also reminded journalists that they can’t do the reporting they need to do.  
“We don’t have the staff to do what we did before,” a journalist told the researchers. “We just don’t. And (the investigative reporting) is really kind of a dulled down version of what we used to have.” 
This change in journalistic priorities troubles Wolgast, as he told me in an interview this week. Oversight of government officials — particularly their power to spend public funds — remains a key function of a free press, Wolgast said. 
“We’re essentially their managers,” Wolgast said. “They work for us, so they should respond to us. Journalism is there because you and I can’t go to every school board meeting and Library Commission meeting and city council meeting and county commission meetings, all the committee meetings in the Legislature.”
“So we need journalism to cover these government bodies,” he continued. “And if the government bodies are going to choose to retaliate in some way, then it’s a threat to oversight, because who else oversees the government?”
Wolgast explained that “shared press distress” needn’t be traumatic.
“Perhaps it can just be distressing to see what happens to another professional. It’s just a concern,” Wolgast said. “Not only that, if it’s happened to him, then it could have happened to me too.”
Giving a name like shared press distress to a familiar feeling will likely seem overly dramatic to many Americans: journalists seeking more of the spotlight, and this time for their suffering. A public already skeptical of journalists might see this new phrase and any journalism scholarship as self-consumed navel gazing. 
This all leads me to ask myself: Do I have this same distress, as a member of the press?
Do I suffer when international journalists mourn fellow reporters who were killed in retribution for their reporting in other countries? Or when national political reporters face heckling and veiled presidential threats at campaign rallies? 
Or when I read of another local Kansas newspaper shedding staff or closing completely?
Before this week, I don’t know if I would have called it shared press distress — but perhaps the phrase will flourish during this challenging era for journalists.

Belief in the spirit world is a key part of many faiths and religions. A 2023 survey of 26 countries revealed that about half the respondents believed in the existence of angels, demons, fairies and ghosts. In the United States, a 2020 poll found that about half of Americans believe ghosts and demons are real.
While the subject of demons and ghosts can inspire dread, the concepts themselves can be confusing: Is there a difference between the two?
Historically, communities have understood the supernatural according to their religious and spiritual traditions. For example, the terrifying ghosts of Pu Songling’s “Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio” operate differently than those haunting the works of William Shakespeare, even though both writers lived in the 17th century.

‘Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus and the Ghost,’ from Shakespeare’s ‘Hamlet,’ Act 1, Scene 4. (Robert Thew/Gertrude and Thomas Jefferson Mumford Collection via The Met.)
Literary representations of ghosts and demons often reflect the anxieties of communities experiencing social, religious or political upheaval. As a scholar of early modern English literature, my research focuses on how everyday people in 16th- and 17th-century Europe used storytelling to navigate major social changes. This era, often called the Renaissance, was punctuated by the establishment of mass media through printing, the global spread of colonization and the emergence of modern science and medicine.
Digging into the literary archive can reveal people’s ideas about demons and ghosts – and what made them different.
 Martin Luther and the Reformation

On Oct. 31, 1517, Martin Luther, an ex-law student and former monk, boldly published his Ninety-Five Theses. In it, he rejected the Catholic Church’s promise that monetary payment to the church could reduce the amount of time one’s soul spent in purgatory. What began as a local protest in Wittenberg, Germany, soon swept all the major European powers into a life and death struggle over religious reform. Towns were besieged, landscapes scorched, villages pillaged.
This period, called the Reformation, led to the establishment of new Christian denominations. Among these Protestant churches’ early teachings was the edict that purgatory did not exist and souls could not return to Earth to haunt the living. Protestant reformers insisted that after death, one’s soul was immediately judged. The virtuous flew up to God in heaven; the sinful burned in hell with the Devil.
According to Protestants, ghosts were invented by Catholic priests to scare people into obedience. For example, the English translator of Ludwig Lavater’s 1572 book “Of Ghostes and Spirites Walking by Night” insists ghosts are the “falsehood of Monkes, or illusions of devils, franticke imaginations, or some other frivolous and vaine perswasions.” Should you ever encounter an “apparition,” you must call it out for what it truly is: a devil pretending to be a ghost.

Title page of Christopher Marlowe’s ‘Doctor Faustus.’ (Iohn Wright/Wikimedia Commons.)
Christopher Marlowe’s play “Doctor Faustus” comments on these debates. Written in the 1580s for a primarily Protestant audience, the play features a scene in which Dr. Faustus and his devil companion, Mephistopheles, trick the pope by snatching away his meal. A bewildered member of the papal court concludes “it may be some ghost … come to beg a pardon of your Holiness.” The audience knows full well, however, that these pranks are committed by the necromancer and his demon.
 Ghostly haunting

In spite of Protestantism’s official stance against ghosts, belief in them persisted in the popular imagination.
Archival records show that ordinary people held fast to popular beliefs despite what their religious authorities decreed. For example, the casebook of Richard Napier, an astrological physician, reports several cases of “spirit” hauntings, including that of a young mother named Catherine Wells who had been “vexed … with a spirit” for three continuous years.
Popular plays provide additional evidence. Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” opens with a midnight visitation by the ghost of Hamlet’s father, telling his son he cannot rest in peace until his murderer is brought to justice. Ghostly victims seeking justice appear in other Shakespearean plays, including “Macbeth” and “Richard III.”
Cheap print, a form of common media, capitalized on the public’s interest in the paranormal. Part entertainment, part journalism, cheap print was read by all sorts of people. A 1662 pamphlet titled “A strange and wonderfull discovery of a horrid and cruel murther [murder]” describes Isabel Binnington’s unsettling encounter with the ghost of Robert Eliot. In her testimonial, she claims that Eliot’s ghost promised he would never hurt her. What he wanted was simply for her to hear his story: He had been murdered for his coins in the very house she occupied.
A 1730 broadside ballad called “The Suffolk Miracle” – still performed today – tells the tale of young lovers parted by an overprotective father. After the daughter is whisked away, her beloved dies of a broken heart. When his ghost later appears to her, she “joy’d to see her heart’s delight.”
 Demonic possession

While reformed Protestant thinkers rejected the existence of ghosts, they enthusiastically accepted the reality of devils.
Reports of demonic possession were popular. Before his ascension to the English throne, King James VI of Scotland published a literary treatise on demonology in 1597. He argues that “assaultes of Sathan are most certainly practized” and “detestable slaves of the Devill” live among us.

‘Saint Anthony Tormented by Demons,’ 1470–74. (Martin Schongauer/Rogers Fund via The Met.)
The diaries of English Puritans offer further proof that beliefs about devilish encounters were common. In the 1650s, the Calvinist preacher Thomas Hall insisted that his godliness attracted the attention of Satan like a moth to a candle. From an early age, he complained, he was subjected to “Satanicall buffettings” and terrifying dreams. He believed, however, that surviving demonic temptation demonstrated his unwavering devotion to God.
Distinguishing ghosts from demons
Based on the literature, what can we conclude about how people saw ghosts and demons?
Early modern people often represented ghosts as sad and pitiable. They were depicted as the spiritual remainder of a recently deceased person, haunting their friends and kin – or, occasionally, a stranger. They retained some of their humanity and were psychically connected to a place, such as their former home, or to a person, such as their most cherished companion.
Demons, by contrast, were almost always malevolent tricksters who served the Devil. Demons lacked knowledge of what it meant to be human. Hell was the demons’ lair. Early modern texts describe them visiting the earthly plane to corrupt, possess or tempt humans to commit self-harm or violence against others.

Then and now, stories of ghosts and demons have provoked fear and wonder. Tales of the supernatural have inspired the imagination of kings, theologians, playwrights and everyday people.
Approaching the topic of the otherworldly with intellectual humility can inspire deeper curiosity about cultures across space and time. As Hamlet muses to his friend after meeting the ghost of his father, “There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”

(Photo courtesy of the PIAA) High school basketball coaches in Pennsylvania may soon have to factor the shot clock into their gameplans.
If the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) approves the 35-second shot clock for high school varsity and junior varsity games, it will be added in three years.
During a meeting of the Pennsylvania Athletic Oversight Committee on Wednesday, PIAA Executive Director Bob Lombardi called the proposal surrounding the implementation of a shot clock an “interesting discussion.”
He said after the steering committee voted down the plan by one vote months ago, but the board of directors at its July meeting discussed any concerns about using it and approved it for the first time.
“What came out of that were, the issues were cost, timing of implementation, training of officials, and training of staff to run them,” Lombardi said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At the PIAA’s October meeting, it gained a second round of approval. The board now has to vote for a third time to give final approval of the shot clock.
The next meeting is scheduled for Dec. 3. If approved, the shot clock will become reality for boys’ and girls’ high school basketball games in the 2028-2029 school year.
“So, three years to give everyone the opportunity to be able to purchase it, get them in their budgets, get them placed and we can train officials as well as table workers,” Lombardi said.

Behind the scenes, the people running wastewater treatment plants work tirelessly on one of the most important yet underappreciated public services. Treatment systems only make headlines when things go wrong, such as in recent months when unlucky Connecticut residents have been subjected to the sights and smells of sewage floating down the Connecticut River. Incidents like these are becoming more common as aging wastewater treatment plant infrastructure struggles to keep up with increased demand. 
Across Connecticut and the entire eastern United States, vital steps to replace and update our old wastewater treatment plants are underway; however, updating the pipes and buildings alone will not be enough. We must rethink the whole management structure and soon — before the problem gets much worse.
Many overflows come from an old model of combined sewage-stormwater systems. For these systems, a heavy storm can overwhelm infrastructure, leading to the release of sewage. In recent years, Connecticut has taken steps forward, moving from over a dozen combined systems down to only four; Hartford’s MDC facility is one of the remaining combined systems. 
In response to recent overflow events, some Connecticut state representatives have argued that these overflows are mostly rainwater, and much of the resulting public health advice is to avoid swimming or fishing for a few days before returning to normal. This advice suggests that the effects of a sewage outflow are fleeting — which may protect us from E. coli and algal blooms — but neglects the slower, growing threat of chemical contamination.
My research focuses on chemical contamination of water in the environment. Untreated sewage often contains industrially produced chemical contaminants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), suspected to increase risk of cancer and pregnancy complications based on studies by the National Institute of Health. After being deposited from the overflow, these chemicals degrade very slowly and can remain in the water column for decades. Each outflow event adds another drop in the bucket of chemical contamination that affects our waters, fish, and eventually, us.
The situation will only become more dire as intensified storms, rising sea levels, and increasingly common extreme weather, pushes our wastewater systems beyond their limits.
There has been finger-pointing and blame over contamination of the Connecticut river across the Connecticut and Massachusetts state line. Rather than squabbling, now is the time to focus on cross-border cooperation. 
To begin, we need updated infrastructure. This is already underway and Connecticut wastewater treatment plants have made strong progress towards repairing aging systems. But the next important step is developing regional cooperation along ecological boundaries rather than political ones. 
The Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments offers a model for a path forward: a coalition of municipalities that allows them to prepare for the changing landscape of wastewater by creating a shared, concrete plan for infrastructure, communication, and collaboration. But rivers do not abide by our state boundaries; we must expand this coalition model to include both Connecticut and Massachusetts. We can treat this issue the same way we handle threats to the Long Island Sound, as a team.
We are already investing billions of dollars into updating our wastewater infrastructure. Now is the time to rethink how we manage our collective wastewater systems — together. Consequences of these overflows remain far longer than the wastewater itself. Nothing we flush away ever really disappears, and neither will the consequences of our inaction.

It is about being accountable for what you say when others disagree.,"Sometimes a single online conversation can reveal more about the state of our culture than any press conference, policy debate, or campaign speech ever could.
In Simsbury, a discussion that began with a simple point about defending a grieving Muslim mother from what appeared to be public religious bias spiraled into something almost unrecognizable. What unfolded was not just disagreement. It was a complete breakdown of moral reasoning and civic integrity. It was a snapshot of what happens when emotion replaces truth and when people mistake moral relativism for open mindedness.
The Inversion of Accountability
The issue at hand was straightforward. A local political leader publicly referred to a Muslim woman as “bigoted.” The woman in question had spoken courageously about her child’s death and her experience of being silenced in a public meeting. Instead of compassion or reflection, she received a label. And when that label was challenged, defenders appeared to insist that criticizing the comment was somehow more offensive than the comment itself.
This is the kind of logic that eats itself alive.
What should have been a clear moment of collective empathy instead turned into an intellectual circus. Some argued that calling the incident discriminatory was “stretching” the truth. Others went further, accusing those who objected of “Gestapo like tactics” simply for tagging journalists and advocacy accounts to bring attention to it.
In this strange reversal, accountability became oppression and bigotry became free speech.
The most revealing part of the exchange was not the hostility, but the pretense of empathy. Several commenters went out of their way to express sympathy for the grieving mother, only to use that sympathy as a shield to scold others for “making it about religion.” They acknowledged her pain while dismissing the context that shaped it. They wanted compassion without complexity.
This is what I call performance empathy. It is the act of appearing kind while silencing what kindness demands you confront. It sounds moderate, but it serves no one except those already comfortable.
The Comfort of Anonymity
The conversation was further distorted by the chorus of anonymous accounts. Behind masks of digital privacy, they hurled accusations of “rage baiting” and “agenda pushing.” They claimed fear for their safety while confidently disparaging anyone using their real name.
Anonymity has a purpose when it protects the vulnerable. But when it becomes a weapon for avoidance, it weakens everything civic life depends on. Our democracy relies on people being willing to stand by their words. Courage is not about shouting the loudest. It is about being accountable for what you say when others disagree.
If your words can wound, they should also have an author.
What happened in this small town online forum reflects a larger cultural sickness that has spread across Connecticut and the country. We have replaced the search for truth with the performance of virtue. We have substituted tone for substance.
The same people who warn against “cancel culture” are often the first to try to silence those who expose discrimination. The same people who preach about free speech recoil when that freedom is used to challenge their own hypocrisy.
In Simsbury, this contradiction was on full display.
What It Says About Us
I do not write this to relitigate every comment in that thread. I write it because that thread, chaotic as it was, revealed a truth about our times.
We live in an era where standing up for someone else’s dignity is seen as a provocation. Where asking questions about power is branded as extremism. Where defending a Muslim woman’s right to be treated with respect somehow makes you the aggressor.
This is not progress. It is moral regression wrapped in polite language.
When public officials or political figures can attack marginalized voices and then be shielded by people calling themselves “moderates,” the problem is not just local. It is systemic. It is cultural. It is what happens when comfort outweighs conscience.
The truth is simple. Defending a person’s faith, dignity, or humanity is not radical. It is the bare minimum of decency.
And if that has become controversial in Simsbury or anywhere, then Connecticut has a far deeper problem than politics. We have a problem of conscience.

Before an audience of 1,800 inside Brown University’s Pizzitola Sports Center, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton fielded a question from the university’s president: Looking back on your political career, is there anything you would change?
“I’d win the Electoral College,” she responded, eliciting applause throughout the arena. 
Clinton, who turned 78 on Sunday, visited Rhode Island’s Ivy League university Thursday evening as part of its Stephen A. Ogden Jr. ’60 Memorial Lecture on International Affairs.
Clinton, the 67th U.S. Secretary of State during President Barack Obama’s first term, is the first of two former top diplomats who will speak at Brown in the next six days. She will be followed next week by the 66th. Condaleazza Rice, who served U.S. Secretary of State during President George W. Bush administration, is scheduled to speak at the next lecture on Nov. 5.
True to the forum, presented by Brown’s Watson School of International and Public Affairs, Clinton stuck mostly to discussing foreign policy during the hourlong question-and-answer session with University President Christina Paxson. But first she gave a shoutout to U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, both of whom were in the audience.
“They have literally been my guys,” she said.
With China’s rise and Russia’s continued aggression against its Eastern European neighbors, Clinton said there’s “a lot of churn” in global politics. Uncertainty from Washington, D.C., she added, will only deepen the instability threatening the U.S.-led world order established after World War II.
“If we don’t know what our policies are, literally from week to week, that gives a lot of room for maneuver by people who don’t wish us well,” Clinton said. “And it also causes others, who have historically been our friends and allies, to begin kind of hedging their bets about what’s going to happen next.”
What’s needed, she said, is having a leader with credibility.
Clinton did give President Donald Trump some kudos on his administration’s cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza reached on Oct. 10 — something she similarly did in 2012 in her final weeks leading Obama’s State Department.
But Clinton said getting both parties to agree to cease hostilities is only the first step in achieving peace in the region. The next move is to begin disarming Hamas militants, which will require some sort of security force on the ground in Gaza.
“Just because they are no longer actively engaged in military action doesn’t mean they have disarmed,” she said. 
Israeli officials say forces in Gaza came under fire from snipers and anti-tank shells in the city of Rafah on Oct. 19. Hamas has denied any involvement in the shooting.
Clinton also questioned the feasibility of Trump’s 20-point peace plan, saying it will take a lot of patience to get other Arab Gulf nation states on board. For those looking to create those diplomatic connections, she suggested making personal connections with their foreign counterparts.
“That is always like an investment you can call on,” she said.
Though some leaders are tougher to try and form that kind of bond. To wit: Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“Vladamir Putin was impossible,” Clinton said. “He wants to destroy us and western civilization and take down the United States — that’s his driving ambition.”

She also referred to the Russian leader as a “horrible misogynist” who is always mansplaining and manspreading, which generated laughs from the crowd.
But there was an instance where she got Putin to open up. She had visited his dacha outside Moscow and recalled asking him about his efforts to conserve Russian wildlife like polar bears and Siberian tigers.
“And all of a sudden he gets animated,” Clinton said. “He jumps up and says, ‘Come with me.’”
She recalled Putin showing her a map of Russia marked with areas where he planned to preserve certain animal species. He even asked about the possibility of organizing a polar bear expedition — but with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.










If we don’t know what our policies are, literally from week to week, that gives a lot of room for maneuver by people who don’t wish us well. And it also causes others, who have historically been our friends and allies, to begin kind of hedging their bets about what’s going to happen next.


– Hillary Clinton


Clinton still blames organized disinformation campaigns for her loss in the 2016 presidential election. And with advancements in artificial intelligence and personalized algorithms, she said she’s worried about the future of American democracy.
“It is so hard to know what is true online,” she said. “It’s very difficult to imagine having an election where voters are being asked to make decisions when there’s no basis in fact for what they’re being asked to choose between.”
But she said she is hopeful American democracy can be sustained if voters are properly educated and think about politics from an issue-based perspective rather than a horserace. Finding common ground is also key, Clinton added.
“We are the longest surviving democracy, and we owe so much to what came before us,” Clinton said. “Part of what we owe is to make sure we don’t lose it.”

Credit: Related DigitalA string of announcements from DTE Energy, Open AI and Related Digital coalesced into another notice from Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer late Thursday afternoon, confirming plans to move forward with development of a data center in Saline Township – following a legal settlement between the developer and the host community.
Whitmer lauded the multi-billion dollar project, calling it the largest in Michigan history, with the facility expected to create 2,500 union construction jobs, alongside 450 permanent jobs on site and 1,500 more in the community. 
“I’m grateful to these cutting-edge companies for betting on Michigan, building on our work to compete for and win big projects in next-generation industries from cars and clean energy to semiconductors and batteries,” Whitmer said in a statement. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to the Executive Office of the Governor, Michigan was selected as the site for the facility due to the state’s tech and construction workforce, tax incentives for data center development, and the location’s proximity to Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti and the University of Michigan’s Ann Arbor Campus. 
Construction on the project is expected to begin in early 2026, with Related Digital and Oracle Cloud developing the facility as part of Oracle’s partnership with Open AI. DTE Energy confirmed it will supply 1.4 gigawatts of load for the facility, marking its first contract with a data center.
Last week, a Washtenaw County judge approved a settlement between Related Digital and Saline Township, with the developer and the owner of the 575 acres of farmland slated for the project filing suit after the Township Board voted 4-1 against rezoning the land for the project, according to a report from Inside Climate News.
The board later voted 4-1 to settle, despite intense opposition from residents and elected officials who raised concerns about traffic, noise, water and energy resources.
Enviros push back on bills giving tax breaks to data centers

Whitmer’s statement aimed to quell some of those concerns, noting the project will not require any additional power generation to operate, and will use a closed loop water cooling system that will not require additional water from the Great Lakes. A traffic study from the Michigan Department of Transportation also found it will have minimal impacts on traffic. 
Whitmer’s announcement did not identify the project as a data center, instead referring to the project as an AI infrastructure facility.
DTE also offered assurances that the data center will absorb all new costs required to serve the facility, painting the facility as a win for consumer energy affordability. 
However, Tim Minotas, the legislative and political director for the Sierra Club’s Michigan chapter stressed the need for protections to ensure that resources allocated to data centers don’t come at the expense of customers. 
“DTE’s announcement today that it will power a massive 1.4-gigawatt data center in Michigan is further proof of what we have been saying since last year: Data centers are coming to Michigan and can pose a threat to our neighborhoods, our economy, energy bills, water and climate without proper guardrails in place,” Minotas said in a statement.
Opposition to data centers swells as more companies set sights on state
Earlier this week environmental advocates rallied at Oakland Community College’s Auburn Hills Campus ahead of a public comment hearing held by the Michigan Public Service Commission, calling for the regulatory body to institute protections against these resource-intensive facilities. 
Andrea Pierce, the policy director for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, warned that data centers can deplete groundwater aquifers and disrupt ecosystems through thermal pollution of surface waters, in addition to pollution with PFAS, methane and other harmful chemicals.

Speaking with reporters before the meeting, Commission Chair Dan Scripps noted that the regulatory body is currently hearing a contested case with Consumers Energy aimed at ensuring ratepayers are protected from increased costs due to the large energy demand of data centers. Scripps said he expected those concerns would be addressed on a utility by utility basis. 
Scripps also noted that there are protections within state law to keep residential, industrial and commercial energy customers from shifting costs from one customer class to another
While speaking with the Michigan Advance Thursday, Nick Dodge, the communications director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters pointed to the organization’s opposition to legislation creating tax incentives for data centers due to a lack of sufficient protections for ratepayers, water conservation and the environment.
The Michigan League of Conservation Voters does not oppose data centers at their core, Dodge explained, acknowledging their role in the economy and the future of technology. However, it’s critical that when these projects do move forward, there are considerations around energy rates, water conservation and whether that energy is sourced from clean energy or fossil fuels, he noted.

Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht were elected as Democrats to the commonwealth’s top court in 2015. Under the state constitution, they must win voters’ approval to stay on the bench in a nonpartisan “yes” or “no” retention election. If they’re not retained, their seats would be open in a competitive 2027 Supreme Court election.
Reflecting a national trend toward more politicized judicial elections across the country, as-yet untold amounts of third-party money are flooding the airwaves, internet and mailboxes with ads. They urge Pennsylvanians either to keep Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht as reliable guardians of fundamental rights or to cast them out as activist judges legislating from the bench.
In an interview with the Capital-Star, Martin said lavish spending in judicial campaigns, such as the $30 million that Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, poured into last year’s Wisconsin Supreme Court election, polarizes what historically have been nonpartisan elections. Martin describes it as an effort by conservatives to buy court seats in an end run on democracy.

 James Markley, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania GOP, it was “comical” to him that Martin described the conservative-backed “vote no” campaign as an affront to democracy. 
“People going to the polls and voting ‘yes’ or ‘no’ on the justices is the very definition of the democratic process,” Markley said, adding that efforts supporting the justices, such as Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro appearing in TV ads, have been just as partisan.
Only one state Supreme Court justice has lost a retention election in 2005, when Justice Russell Nigro was voted off the bench in the backlash over the legislature’s midnight vote to give themselves and state judges pay raises. But even that election was low-key compared to this year’s advertising blitz.
“I think what’s different this time is that just about every Pennsylvanian has been touched by the decisions of this Supreme Court,” Markley said. He noted the justices participated in decisions to count mail-in ballots that arrived after the deadline in the 2020 presidential election and to uphold former Gov. Tom Wolf’s COVID-19 pandemic lockdown that shuttered businesses across the state.
“There are still a lot of people who are still really angry about this,” Markley said. “They can go and make a difference so something like this doesn’t happen again.”
Martin spoke with the Capital-Star about why the Democratic National Committee is investing resources to support Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht and how the outcome of the race will affect the lives of Pennsylvanians for more than a decade to come.
(This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.)
To begin, why does the party see this as a race to dedicate resources, your resources?
The stakes are very high in these races here. What we’ve seen, unfortunately in recent years, is attempts by far right billionaires to buy Supreme Court seats around the country … so they can do an end around state legislatures and governors and basically the will of the people in terms of direct representation.
It’s easier for them to buy Supreme Court seats than to flip majorities as an example, right? But what they’re doing is they’re then legislating from the bench, which is, you know, obviously unseemly and unheard of in this country … It’s happening now, and unfortunately, we’re seeing it more and more in this country.

And so what does that mean for Pennsylvanians? Well, it means that their rights are under attack. Things like their right to make their own decisions over their health care, for women to make decisions over their body, and voting rights are under attack. Everything from redistricting and education funding and everything else that comes before the courts.
What you want is fair-minded independent judges on the bench who are going to take their job seriously, which is to not legislate or push an agenda, but actually base their decisions on the rule of law and base their decision on legal precedent, not on politics.
What do you see as the immediate and longer-term consequences of the non-retention of any or all of the three justices?
I think that abortion rights in this state would be in jeopardy. I think voting rights would be in jeopardy. I think education funding would be in jeopardy. You know, Pennsylvania has the longest Equal Rights Amendment in the country, and I think that would be in jeopardy.
Again, people have to ask themselves, why are far right conservative billionaires spending the type of money they are to try to buy Supreme Court seats? And it’s very clear, right? It’s because they want to push their far right agenda.
How could this election affect Pennsylvania’s representation in Congress over the next decade?
I think it’s critical. Just a couple weeks ago in the U.S. Supreme Court, there were arguments over Louisiana v. Callais … where it’s fairly likely that they’ll gut Section Two of the Voting Rights Act … around racial gerrymandering. 
Currently, the courts have said “yes,” even as recently as a couple years ago, that Section Two is valid and should be enforced, thereby prohibiting racial gerrymandering, racial redistricting. And now, with that, likely to be struck down in 2032 during the next reapportionment, there will be no guardrails on redistricting. 
Then it will be up to the courts and the state legislatures to decide, absent any federal guidance right or the Voting Rights Act, how they’re going to draw the line. So the import of this court is even more important later than it is now in terms of redistricting. There’ll be no guardrails now, and it will be likely up to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to rule on these matters. And that’s why who sits on the court really matters.
Do you see Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court having an outsize effect on national politics, depending on which way the balance goes?
Pennsylvania is a critical battleground state and a swing state for both parties, and so anything that happens here, certainly has a huge impact on national politics. But you know, the reason we’re here is … because of what would happen if these justices aren’t retained, and you essentially sell these seats to the Republicans and the conservative movement.
One of my concerns is, if they prevail here, they’re going to take this playbook all over the nation, and they’re going to try to run the same play in every state. We’ve already seen them try that over many years now, and they’re going to continue regardless. But if they’re successful here, they’ll be emboldened, and so we need to fight them each and every step of the way. I’m pretty bullish on our chances here.
I’ve been here a lot over the last eight months that I’ve been chair, and I can tell you, there’s a lot of energy on the ground out there for the vote yes campaign. And the one thing that I think that differentiates the two campaigns here is one is spending a lot of money on TV and mail, and the other is spending a lot of time and money on organizing, getting out there and talking to voters face to face, on the phones, texting, doing the grassroots organizing and having the conversations with voters that are going to matter.
What kind of questions are you hearing from people when you go out door knocking?
Earlier in the year, there was sort of a lot of confusion. People weren’t really paying attention. But you know, given the amount of money and ads and mail and conversations on the doors they’ve been having, most folks at this stage of the game understand what this election is about.

I think they’re smart enough to understand that if you’re a billionaire, and you’re investing as much money as you are, why would you be doing that? And I don’t think people feel like his argument, or these other folks who are investing in this election, their argument is salient.
Is having an elected High Court is a good thing for Pennsylvanians?
What we’ve seen in the last couple decades now is a politicization of the courts and a politicization of local offices like school boards and county boards and city councils. And there was a day, when I grew up, you didn’t see the type of partisanship involved in judicial races or school board races.
And now, all these races have been politicized, and the amount of money that’s being spent on judicial races, I don’t think it’s what our founders of this country or the framers of the Constitution ever envisioned.
The judiciary is supposed to be completely independent and not involved in politics … so I don’t think it’s right to be honest with you, but that’s not up to me. That’s up to each state and other jurisdictions to decide how they’re going to elect or appoint their judges. But for me, it certainly seems unseemly to me to be honest with you. The fact that they have become partisan, is not a good thing, I think, for our democracy.
Is there a way to put the brakes on it?
Part of it is getting people in Congress who are willing to pass things like the Freedom to Vote Act and John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. Both of those bills would have actually started to unwind some of what we’re talking about here by creating uniform election laws around the country and … limiting the role of outside dark money in our politics is a big part of it. It’s an interesting question to be honest with you, one I don’t know how to solve.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image002-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 20:16:53.058136

(Google Maps)State investigators will look into an incident in which an apparent federal agent threw a woman to the ground during a protest in Durango earlier this week, the Colorado Bureau of Investigations announced Thursday.
Durango Police Chief Brice Current requested the investigation, according to the CBI statement.
The Durango protest on Tuesday was over the earlier arrest and detention of a Colombian man, Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, and his two children. The trio was detained on their way to school. The family has an active asylum case and has been in Colorado for 18 months, according to the Durgano-based nonprofit Compañeros: Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center.
During the protest, held outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, a law enforcement officer, who CBI says appears to be a federal agent, was video recorded grabbing a woman’s phone and pushing her to the ground. The video was published by The Colorado Sun.
CBI will investigate whether there were state criminal law violations during the incident and then give the completed investigation to the 6th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said Wednesday that ICE did not inform his office about the operation to detain Jaramillo-Solano.
“The federal government’s lack of transparency about its immigration actions in Durango and in the free state of Colorado remains extremely maddening. The federal government should prioritize apprehending and prosecuting dangerous criminals, no matter where they come from, and keep our communities safe instead of snatching up children and breaking up families,” he wrote in a post on social media.

On Nov. 1, the education department plans to implement changes to providers’ reimbursement rates under the School Readiness Assistance Program, a financial aid program for low-income families to access child care. The working group put forth a different set of proposed rate changes that the department will accept or decline by Saturday.
After a work session Tuesday, group members presented a $28 million plan that they said should sustain the School Readiness Assistance Program for eight weeks and forgo the need to ask the state Legislature for financial help. The $28 million would come from the federal Child Care and Development Block Grant, which supports the School Readiness Assistance Program.
The commission reviewed and unanimously accepted the proposed rate changes in a virtual meeting Thursday. If the education department implements the rate changes and continues them after the eight-week stopgap, the plan will cost nearly $77 million through Sept. 30, 2026, according to the figures presented at the meeting.
This is about $7 million more than the rate plan proposed by the education department, but the agency believes the working group’s proposal is “still doable,” said Stacy Smith, deputy commissioner for the agency’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.

“It just makes this a little bit tighter, and it’s something that I think we [should] continue to come back and report every month where we are,” Smith said.
The Early Childhood Commission convened the working group of child care experts last week after providers said the upcoming rate changes and existing higher copayments for families would lead to child care layoffs and closures throughout the state. Increased copayments implemented Oct. 1 have already forced some Arkansas child care facilities to close because parents could not afford to pay more, working group member and Northwest Arkansas child care center owner Shahid Sheikh told the commission earlier this month.
The department announced the changes Sept. 19 with the goal of reducing the four-digit School Readiness Assistance waitlist and making the program more financially sustainable. Child care providers said the changes would make child care unaffordable for some low-income families.
The federal government shut down Oct. 1 and has yet to reopen, blocking access to the majority of the state’s Child Care and Development Block Grant funding.
 Potential next steps

Provider reimbursement rates are higher for child care centers that have achieved higher quality ratings on a scale of one to six. The working group proposed making reimbursement rates the same for the third and fourth levels and for the fifth and sixth levels. This would circumvent the problem of squeezing providers financially by lowering their base rates, and it would ensure continued quality care at each level, working group member Dawn Colyer said Tuesday.
Northwest Arkansas would have a different reimbursement scale than the rest of the state because of the region’s higher cost of living and because private child care providers in the region charge families more than in other areas, Colyer said.
For families with multiple children, the working group proposed capping copayments at 7% of their household income and charging families the same percentage of their base rate for each child’s age group.
The working group’s third recommendation was for the education department to remove the 72-month limit on low-income families’ access to the School Readiness Assistance Program.

The commission’s acceptance of the working group’s recommendations was a “huge” step forward, Jenny Castillo, who owns five Spanish language-immersion child care centers in Northwest Arkansas, said in a virtual press conference held after the commission’s Thursday meeting.
“The department just has to change the way that they’re allocating the funding that they currently have in order to make it a little more fair and make it a little more accessible to families and to allow providers to actually stay afloat,” Castillo said. “We’re not done yet, because that’s just going to hold us over for a while, and so this is a long game now of what child care is going to ultimately look like in the state of Arkansas.”
Rep. Denise Garner, a Fayetteville Democrat and a member of both the working group and the Early Childhood Commission, said she hopes the communication between the child care industry and the education department will continue after the funding crisis is averted.
“I wish it had happened earlier, but that’s not the way the government has worked in the past, so I’m hoping that this is an example of what we can do across the board,” Garner said. “…We’ve got to have the knowledge base from those folks who are grassroots and boots on the ground.”

(Photo by Charles O'Rear / Getty Images)Amid ongoing proposed rulemaking that would require more funds from oil and gas operators to clean up New Mexico’s abandoned wells, Republican state lawmakers on Thursday pressed state officials over the current funding for such work.
In a tense and sometimes testy interim Water and Natural Resources Committee hearing in Artesia, members of the minority party told presenters from the state’s Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department and the State Land Office to reconsider pursuing higher investment from oil and gas operators, saying it would harm the industry as a whole, and smaller oil producers in particular.
“If those wells aren’t producing, guess what, y’all don’t have a job because that’s what’s paying your wages right now, OK?” said Sen. Candy Spence Ezzell (R-Roswell) during one exchange.
Earlier this year, legislative analysts estimated that in the coming years, New Mexico faces between $700 million to $1.6 billion in costs to clean up abandoned oil and gas wells. One of the June report’s recommendations included updating the state’s rules around the bonds companies guarantee to better reflect the costs for cleanup. That proposal is currently under consideration—and receiving public comment—by the state’s oil and gas regulatory committee.
The state has identified more than 700 “orphan wells” that need to be plugged, EMNRD Deputy Secretary Ben Shelton told the committee, but many more wells are entering the end of their lifespans.
“There’s another 4,000 to 5,000 that are currently sitting in an inactive status or extremely low-producing status that we have an eye on that looms in the background of our current plugging list,”  Shelton told the committee.
Rep. Rod Montoya (R-Farmington), however, called the proposed revamped rules a “money grab,” and said the state should instead change the distribution of tax revenue intended to address the issue.
Specifically, EMNRD uses money from the state’s reclamation fund—intended to plug wells and clean up pollution—which itself receives a portion of a 1959-era conservation tax placed on various extractive industries. Since 2022, the agency has also received $55.5 million in multiyear federal grants it has used for the work.
Shelton said the state tries to spend federal funds first, and leave more money available in the state’s reclamation fund to address unpredictable costs for environmental remediation. The fund currently contains more than $75 million and the state this year requested about $21 million for plugging wells and environmental remediation.
Montoya noted that under state law, the majority of the $120 million to $140 million collected annually in conservation taxes ends up in the general fund. Only about 10% a year benefits the state’s reclamation fund.
As such, he said, the state should ensure more of the conservation tax benefits the reclamation fund, rather than look to industry to pay for the cleanup.
“I cannot see a justification to go out there and ask industry for more money to do the same thing that we’re already collecting money for, ” Montoya said.
Shelton, in response to questions along the same line from Rep. Jonathan Henry (R-Artesia), said that not only would spending the entire $76 million currently in the reclamation fund be insufficient to address the problem, but “if 100% of the conservation tax was directed to the [reclamation] fund, that would not be enough for the state to manage our cleanup liability. If you took the conservation tax amounts on operators and increased it and then gave 100% to the [reclamation] fund, it would not be enough. We are talking about potentially billions of dollars of liability,” he said.
Rep. Elaine Sena Cortez (R-Hobbs) responded that lawmakers have the chance to increase the reclamation fund for clean up. Previous legislative efforts to change the distribution proportion have failed.
“Not to beat a dead horse, but if we utilize the reclamation fund for its intended purposes at full capacity — and the keyword is full capacity — it’s going to help producers curb costs, and then it provides an environmental win as well,” she said. “And at the end of the day, that’s what we all want.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As Utah has garnered national attention for Republican state leaders’ eagerness to fulfill President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets,” Gov. Spencer Cox says their vision for a yet-to-be built 1,300-bed homeless campus in northwest Salt Lake City is a “top priority.” 
Plans for the campus are still taking shape. But the state’s top homelessness leaders have proposed including hundreds of beds for people who are civilly committed — or court ordered into mental health treatment. They also envision an “accountability center” or a “secure residential placement facility” for substance abuse treatment as an alternative to jail, where people who are “sanctioned” to go there would not be able to leave voluntarily. 
Pushing back against criticisms from some Democrats and homeless advocates likening the proposal to a “prison” for the homeless, Cox on Wednesday said state leaders are intent on trying something new — because, he said, so far current efforts to reduce homelessness haven’t worked. 
“Look, everything we’ve been doing has been a complete and abject failure,” Cox told Madison Mills, a reporter at Axios who questioned the governor about state leaders’ approach to homelessness during a summit focused on housing issues. 
Utah’s new homeless campus should have 300-plus beds for civil commitment, board chair says

“This isn’t just, you know, holding people against their will. It’s getting them the help and the support that they need,” Cox said. 
The governor also balked at a quote in a New York Times article published Wednesday in which a woman experiencing homelessness compared a rendering of the homeless campus to a “concentration camp.” 
“This idea that it’s, you know, compared to Nazi Germany … I just, I don’t understand that level of thinking,” he said. “It’s just crazy to me. I mean, as if, you know, Hitler were to, what, round up people who are dying on the streets in their own filth addicted to drugs and giving them the support they need? Like, there is no comparison — at all.”
The ‘sea change’ happening in Utah 
Earlier this year, the governor said a “sea change” in Utah’s homeless system was coming — one that emphasized cracking down on camping and drug use while also increasing drug and mental health treatment. But at the time he also acknowledged the state would need more jail and treatment beds to make it happen. 
Wednesday, Cox said “compassion” is not “allowing people to die on our streets” and letting public places become unsafe for them and others. “There is no compassion in that, at all.” 
“So what we have to do is provide the services that people need, and we have to hold people accountable,” he said. “This is the social order. You don’t get to just camp wherever you want to camp. That can’t be a thing.”

In the past, as state and local leaders have tried to crack down on public camping, it’s often resulted in pushing people experiencing homelessness around rather than into shelter. For years, the state’s homeless shelters have been maxed out. The planned 1,300-bed homeless campus has been proposed to also bolster the state’s homeless shelter capacity during a time when the state’s homeless population continues to rise. 
“If you don’t have a place to stay, then we will give you a place to stay. That’s what we’re doing,” Cox said. “What we’re talking about is a small group of people who are unsheltered and who won’t take help, won’t go to a shelter, and are breaking lots of other laws. And that very small population, we have to help them. … When you’ve got a needle in your arm or you’re on meth or fentanyl or whatever it is, you can’t make rational decisions.” 
Cox said today’s laws “don’t allow us to help people get to a point where they can do that,” and that needs to change. 
What will Utah do to fulfill Trump’s executive order?
Trump’s executive order directs the U.S. attorney general to “seek, in appropriate cases, the reversal of Federal or State judicial precedents and the termination of consent decrees that impede the United States’ policy of encouraging civil commitment of individuals with mental illness who pose risks to themselves or the public or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves in appropriate facilities for appropriate periods of time.” 
The order also directs the attorney general to assist state and local governments “through technical guidance, grants, or other legally available means,” to implement “maximally flexible civil commitment, institutional treatment, and ‘step-down’ treatment standards.” 
Utah homeless board proposes ‘initial framework’ to respond to Trump’s executive order

It’s not yet clear how Utah will specifically act when it comes to civilly committing more people. But in answering a call from Cox and top Republican legislative leaders urging action to “fulfill” Trump’s executive order, the Utah Homeless Services Board recently wrote in a letter it would “coordinate with the White House” to explore “becoming a pilot for the rest of the country on how to deploy an exhaustive treatment-focused intervention that is dignified, humane, and efficacious.” 
Though Utah’s plans are still taking shape publically, Cox said there “are a lot of blue state governors who are looking at what we’re doing right now,” and he argued that finding a new approach to homelessness is “not a red state, blue state thing.” 
“Everybody knows what they’ve done has been a failure,” Cox said. “Go to any major city in this country, and you will see how we’ve failed as a society and how we’ve failed to protect the most vulnerable amongst us.” 
But there are still many details surrounding the so-called “transformative” homeless campus that need to be sorted out — including how the expensive project will be funded. It’s expected to cost more than $75 million to build, plus north of $34 million a year in ongoing funding to operate. 
Some, including Democrats and homeless providers, have expressed concerns that for the homeless campus to be a success, it will require even more money — and need to be fully funded. And they’ve said if Utah’s current homeless shelters and other resources like deeply affordable housing, substance use treatment, mental health treatment, and jail capacity were funded more substantially, perhaps the state wouldn’t have as acute homeless problems as it does today.

Republican state leaders including Cox, however, have said they want the state’s homeless system to move away from “Housing First” policies that they say “lack accountability.” Currently, federal “Housing First” grants are prioritized to providers who use that approach, which national homeless advocates have defended as an evidence-based and effective solution to homelessness. 
Housing First is an approach that calls for providing housing without first requiring the person to address other problems such as mental health issues or substance abuse, as other approaches to homelessness do. Advocates say providing supportive services to address such problems is easier in a safe and stable housing situation.
But earlier this year, the Utah Legislature passed a resolution — sponsored by Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, whom Cox on Thursday appointed as the state’s new homeless coordinator — urging the federal government to change federal homelessness regulations. 
That included a request to “rescind housing first policy mandates to permit flexibility” for housing options that “meet the diverse needs and preferences of families experiencing homelessness, including sobriety, goal-setting, and accountability.”

It’s possible Utah leaders may rely on some amount of federal funding to help build the homeless campus — but that remains to be seen. Otherwise, state leaders will need to prioritize funding in the state budget. 
How will the campus be funded?
When asked about funding for the homeless campus after Wednesday’s housing summit, Cox told reporters he’s “in talks with the Legislature right now.” 
“We know it’s going to be a tight budget year, but this has to be my top priority. It is my top priority,” he said. “We’re also working with the federal government and hopeful that they’ll see the wisdom in this, and they expressed interest in helping these types of projects.” 
The governor said the campus could be a “collaborative project together” with the federal government. But if not, “I’m going to be looking at my budget — where can we cut back? What can we do?” 
He said he doesn’t think the state has the option to do nothing. 
“We have to get this right,” he said. “We’ve been failing for so long and I’m not willing to give up.”
Cox acknowledged, however, that without money, the effort could hit a dead end. 
“Nothing happens,” he said, “if we don’t get the funding.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Nearly a million New Jersey residents who rely on federal food assistance are poised to lose those benefits this weekend when President Donald Trump’s administration is expected to suspend the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
The Trump administration has held a hard line on SNAP during its fight with Democrats over the federal government shutdown, which is now in its fifth week. Administration officials have also refused to release available contingency funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that’s meant to cover food assistance during government shutdowns.
“It’s so unfortunate that so many people are going to be put in the crosshairs of this conflict at the federal level. It’s just unprecedented,” said Amy Flynn, CEO of the Trenton Area Soup Kitchen.
About 813,000 New Jersey residents across more than 436,000 households rely on SNAP benefits, representing about 1 in 8 households, state data shows. Children, senior citizens, and people with disabilities are disproportionately represented.
New Jersey residents got more than $1.9 billion in SNAP assistance in the 2024 fiscal year, putting the state 13th nationally in such aid, according to data compiled by the health research nonprofit KFF.
SNAP benefits vary widely because they’re based on household size, income, and other circumstances. But the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated the average monthly benefit per person last year in New Jersey was $194, and noted that most recipients have incomes below the poverty line.
LaPreya Cooper, 32, of Trenton, began receiving SNAP benefits in February after she lost her job and became homeless. The benefits helped her get back on her feet, and she now has an apartment and is studying to become a chef at a culinary program through the Trenton Area Soup Kitchen.
“It definitely has been a big help,” said Cooper, who estimated that she gets about $500 in SNAP benefits monthly. “Not getting it this month is going to be a wringer.”
As fears began circulating last month that SNAP could end, Cooper said she reserved some benefits to carry her through November. She also relies on food pantries and soup kitchen meals.
She’s especially anxious about losing assistance because she’s pregnant, and friends who similarly struggle share her stress, she said.
“A lot of my peers and people who are going through what I’m going through are not taking it well,” Cooper said. “They are planning on going into stores and just walking out with food, if it comes to it.”
Lawmakers in some states, including Connecticut, Vermont, New Mexico, and Louisiana, have agreed to provide at least partial funding for SNAP benefits if the feds follow through on suspending benefits.

New Jersey officials have not. Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex), a frequent sponsor and champion of legislation to combat hunger, said state officials likely “don’t have $85 million set aside” to cover a SNAP lapse.
“We’re going to have to continue to evaluate where we’re at and what we do,” Coughlin told the New Jersey Monitor.
The Murphy administration announced Thursday that it would give $42 million in state funding to six food banks across New Jersey on Friday to strengthen the safety net protecting people who struggle with food insecurity.
The money isn’t new funding. It was already in the state budget to support food banks through the current fiscal year, but officials are distributing it “ahead of schedule” because they expect people to turn to food pantries in the absence of SNAP benefits, said Maggie Garbarino, a spokeswoman for the governor’s office.
A coalition of states, including New Jersey, sued Trump administration officials Tuesday for the looming “illegal” SNAP suspension, which New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called “a clear attempt at subverting the authority of Congress.”
“New Jersey families are being used as political pawns by the Trump Administration,” Platkin said Tuesday in a statement.
Congressional leaders failed to agree this week on a bill that would have extended SNAP funding for 42 million Americans, as well as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC.
Peter Chen, a senior policy analyst with progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, agreed SNAP is a critically important program for keeping families fed in a state where 1 in 10 households grapples with food insecurity.
“SNAP is not some sort of luxury,” Chen said. “The average SNAP benefit per person is less than $200, which averages out to, like, $2 a meal, which is not affording anyone groceries these days, especially given overall food prices. This threat of losing SNAP benefits on November 1 is dire for many families.”
Food insecurity already was growing even before the SNAP threats emerged, Flynn noted.

The Trenton Area Soup Kitchen served 59,000 meals last month — a record high since it was founded in 1982, she said. Staffers ramped up food purchases and added a second shift in the kitchen to accommodate the surge they expect next month if SNAP assistance ends, she added.
Flynn encouraged people to support hunger-fighting nonprofits like hers by donating money or food and volunteering their time.
“We know that the need is just going to be great. There’s a lot of anxiety in the community,” she said.
David Ireland is founder of the Care Center of New Jersey, which runs a food pantry in Rockaway.
The threat to SNAP benefits comes as food pantries are preparing for Thanksgiving food distribution, one of the busiest times for antihunger groups, Ireland noted. His group expects to distribute more than 100,000 pounds of food to 2,500 families this year, up from 80,000 pounds for nearly 2,000 families last year.
“More families are coming in who’ve never needed help before,” Ireland said. “With federal aid going on pause, we anticipate the lines will grow, the shelves will empty faster, and the needs will become urgent. We’re ready to respond — but we need the community alongside us.”
State officials said people who receive supplemental state aid will continue to get it. About 32,000 households that get less than $95 in SNAP benefits now get state assistance to cover the difference from the federal minimum of $23, said Tom Hester, a spokesman for the state Department of Human Services. That totals about $2 million a month, Hester said.
The federal government pays close to $160 million a month to New Jersey SNAP recipients. The state has a surplus of over $6 billion. It’s unclear whether and when officials could decide to tap that to cover SNAP benefits.
Coughlin encouraged New Jersey residents to donate to food banks, volunteer, and “stick up for people, particularly at this time of Thanksgiving.” He called the looming SNAP suspension and the Trump administration’s refusal to release contingency funding “a cruel choice” and “mean-spirited.”
Expediting state funds to food banks will help because they’re “the first line of defense,” Coughlin added.
“It’s a crisis, and swift action is appropriate,” he said.
Chen agreed many states can’t afford to — and shouldn’t have to — foot the bill for the feds’ failure to pay SNAP benefits.
“This is an entirely federal program that has entirely been paid by the feds, that in every previous government shutdown has been paid out through the USDA contingency fund, including in the first Trump administration,” Chen said. “The position that the feds can’t pay this out is a totally absurd one which jeopardizes the lives of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans for what amounts to total bureaucratic game-playing.”

The rapidly approaching cutoff of food aid to tens of millions of Americans is posing that question to Beacon Hill, boxing legislative leaders and Gov. Maura Healey into a corner over whether and how to fund the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program now – and foreshadowing challenging budget math that looms on the longer-term horizon. 
Anti-hunger advocates and budget analysts stressed that the imminent crisis is a federal creation that could be avoided at the Trump administration’s will or by a Congressional deal to reopen the government. 
But even if the long-term responsibility is on Washington, top Massachusetts Democrats who control state government have been forced into a politically difficult decision: deploy tens or hundreds of millions of state dollars to temporarily replace a massive program, or allow more than 1 million residents to go without food aid until the federal government changes course. 
It’s not the only time policymakers here will need to grapple with paying for SNAP, either. The debate foreshadows higher costs that Massachusetts will likely need to absorb starting in two years under a change already enshrined in federal law.  “The onus here is on the federal government to do their job, and they have abdicated their responsibility in doing that. But in Massachusetts, we can make a different choice,” said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. “There’s a variety of options for what we could do here.” 
Days away from the deadline, Healey indicated on Thursday that she has no plans to tap the state’s record $8.6 billion long-term savings account, known as the “rainy day fund.” Instead, she announced plans to double state funding for food banks in November to $8 million and launched a new website to connect needy residents to resources – a small amount when compared to the more than $210 million the federal government allocates to Massachusetts each month to SNAP recipients. 
Late Thursday, a federal judge indicated she might soon grant a temporary restraining order to reverse the Department of Agriculture’s decision to stop funding the SNAP program during the shutdown, according to Politico. 
But it’s not clear how much money would flow into the program or when those funds would appear even if the judge orders the Trump administration to use emergency federal funds. And, other Massachusetts power players have not made clear the exact limits of what they’re comfortable pursuing as the pressure grows more intense.  
House budget chief Aaron Michlewitz told reporters Wednesday that officials are “looking at all options.” He also described the prospect of a “slippery slope” if the state commits too much to replacing federal dollars, especially with other impacts about to hit heating assistance and the Head Start early education program. 
“This isn’t just a one-issue conversation,” Michlewitz said of SNAP. “Certainly, we are concerned about that one issue, but this is a much broader discussion about what is happening with the federal government in relation to our reliance on how much we’re gaining from them, and in turn, what is going to happen with the shutdown.” 
A spokesperson for Senate President Karen Spilka said “conversations are ongoing about ways to mitigate the harm being brought upon us by President Trump’s decision to withhold funding.” 
“That said, no state can permanently sustain the hundreds of millions of dollars in long-term SNAP funding that the federal government is deliberately withholding,” the spokesperson, Gray Milkowski, said. “President Trump could release the funds today, and if he refuses then Congress should hold him to account.” 
The Trump administration announced in recent weeks that it will no longer issue SNAP benefits starting November 1, blaming the ongoing federal government shutdown and congressional Democrats, who continue to push for extension of tax credits that reduce health insurance premiums. 
SNAP provides lower-income households with funds every month, up to $994 for a family of four, to help cover the costs of food. And during economic downturns, every $1 spent on the nation’s largest anti-hunger program generates $1.54 in economic activity, with SNAP dollars supporting grocery stores and farmers, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities — meaning any pause in SNAP benefits threatens ripple effects across the economy. 
The dire consequences of a possible SNAP freeze were laid bare earlier this week at a rally on the State House steps, where Chelsea resident and SNAP recipient Maria Torres warned that cutting off access to the aid could thrust her into food insecurity. 
“It is not just a government program,” she said. “It is a lifeline.”

At that rally on Tuesday, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell announced she would join two dozen other states in suing to stop the end of SNAP aid. And Healey last week joined with the United Way to seek private donations to help cover food for those in need, warning at the time that “neither the state nor any organization here is going to be able to backfill SNAP benefits.” 
In recent years, Massachusetts has already committed state dollars toward maintaining programs originally paid for by Washington. 
The state is using its own money — $180 million this fiscal year — to provide free meals to all students in K-12 schools after the federal government ended a similar pandemic-era offering. Policymakers also made permanent an early childhood education grant program that helps providers cover operational expenses, totaling $475 million in state-level costs this year, and similarly launched as temporary federal aid. 
When it comes to food assistance, though, the scope is much larger. 
Massachusetts typically receives north of $210 million each month in federal funding for SNAP, according to the Department of Transitional Assistance. That’s more in a single month than the amount allotted for a full year of providing no-cost school meals to all students, and an annual rate of around $2.5 billion, rivaling total funding for MassHealth, the single largest area of spending in the state budget. 
“The state budget cannot absorb even one month of federal failure,” DTA wrote in an FAQ about the imminent lapse in SNAP benefits. 
Some activists and analysts disagree, arguing that Beacon Hill has resources available to float benefits temporarily even if the costs of a long-term replacement are too steep. 
“I don’t know what the federal government is going to do and if government is going to open up by December. I have no crystal ball, nor do any of us,” Negus said. “What I do know is that we can take steps as a Commonwealth to at least mitigate the harm in November.” 
Lawmakers have hesitated to dip into the rainy day fund after their willingness to do so in 2017 prompted S&P to downgrade the state’s bond rating. 
“Obviously, there’s a lot of hesitation to use it, but we believe that you have $8 billion sitting there. There’s no reason we couldn’t tap [it], even if you took half of that, and at least gave people something,” said Chelsea Sedani, director of advocacy at the left-leaning Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center. “I don’t know how we could sit here as a state and not do something.” 
One sign at the Tuesday rally bore a similar message aimed not at Washington, but at state lawmakers: “You can’t save for a rainy day,” it read, “while people starve today.” 
House Speaker Ron Mariano warned that dipping into long-term savings to keep benefits flowing could create more problems. 
“There is no end to the potential risk that we have running through the rainy day fund [and] backfilling federal programs,” he said Wednesday. “We would then be in the position of picking winners and losers, and it’s the federal government who is choosing not to fund these things.” 
Seeking to contrast himself from Healey, Republican gubernatorial challenger Mike Kennealy announced his support for dipping into the rainy day fund to keep SNAP benefits afloat. 
Kennealy’s campaign said “fully funding SNAP for one month would use about 2.5% of the current fund balance.” He added that if he were governor, he would propose legislation limiting eligibility for state-funded food aid only to lawful residents who have been in Massachusetts for at least six months.

Washington has continued to pay food aid during prior government shutdowns, and advocates called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to tap into contingency reserves or transfer from other accounts to do so. (USDA suggested contingency funds are “not legally available” for that purpose, according to NPR.) 
Many states are directing residents toward food banks in preparation for SNAP benefits to lapse. Some are using their own funding to mitigate the change, including New York, where Gov. Kathy Hochul has outlined plans to deploy about $41 million. 
Vermont officials on Wednesday moved to fund food aid for the first half of November with the support of Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who said it is “our obligation at this point as states to do what we can for the people we serve,” according to VTDigger. But Healey expressed no intent to follow suit. 
“They’re very different things,” Healey said when asked why she wants USDA to spend money from its contingency fund while expressing no interest in using the state’s reserves. “No state is tapping into its rainy day fund or stabilization fund, as it’s called. No state is doing that. There’s a reason for that.”  
With Nov. 1 inching closer and a deal in Washington proving elusive, the food fight is now landing squarely in state capitals. 
“It’s clear that the approach of this federal government is to take these programs that have historically been funded by the federal government and put them on states. But states have to balance their budget, and states don’t have the resources for programs like SNAP,” Erin McAleer, president of the anti-hunger organization Project Bread, told CommonWealth Beacon. “So I do think that part of the strategy is putting governors and state legislatures in this really difficult position of figuring out what to fund with limited resources.” 
The upheaval, though, could be just a preview of what’s to come. More food aid costs are set to land on states in the years ahead, and Massachusetts could be forced to bear the brunt of it.  
The Republican megalaw enacted earlier this year implemented a host of changes to SNAP eligibility and funding, including a new requirement that for the first time will require certain states to pay a portion of the benefits. 
This cost shift will start in October 2027, and what states owe will depend on their “payment error rate,” or what share of payments were too large or too small. States with error rates above 10 percent will be required to cover 15 percent of benefit costs, while states with error rates below 6 percent won’t have to chip in at all. 
Massachusetts, with its 14 percent error rate last year, could be on the hook for tens of millions of dollars per month to maintain benefits for SNAP recipients in the state. .  
The state is working to lower its error rate by hiring more case workers, reinstating requirements that households periodically submit paperwork and partake in interviews related to their SNAP eligibility, and improve technology platforms and phone lines to improve eligibility determination.   
But if it can’t lower the error rate far enough, state policymakers will be forced to make tough choices around how to grow revenue, cut programs, or both. 
“We have so many needs outside of [the federal cuts], and so we’re in a situation as a state where we really need to think thoughtfully about new revenue,” Sedani said. “When we have a federal government that’s so focused on giving tax cuts to the rich and making the rich richer at the expense of people’s food, we as a state have an ability and a choice to do it differently.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10_28_SNAP_rally_4-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-30 19:17:33.137306

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN – A key associate in the effort to defraud financial institutions out of $45 million is headed to prison, with a judge condemning his role as “deliberate and calculated.”
Jesse Hill, a financial advisor based out of Hickman, helped Lincoln businessman Aaron Marshbanks fool nearly 20 banks into loaning Marshbanks money, purportedly for real estate ventures. Hill, 35, was sentenced to five years in federal prison Thursday.
It was one of the largest bank frauds in state history and was first reported by the Examiner a month after Marshbanks was found dead in a downtown Lincoln parking garage of a drug overdose.
Supporters of Hill from his church, Country Bible, filled a courtroom to overflowing at the Federal Courthouse in a show of support for the married father of three young girls. He was a board member at the church and a Sunday School teacher.
But while U.S. District Judge Susan Bazis noted the throng in the courtroom, she said that Hill’s conduct was not “a one-time mistake,” but one that extended for several months and involved multiple requests for loans from banks, often totaling more than $2 million.
The banks, in the end, lost more than $30 million, the judge said, which wiped out any earnings some banks made and denied bank employees of bonuses and raises.
“You, Mr. Hill, were an integral part of that scheme,” Bazis said during a 20-minute lecture from the bench. “This particular offense would not have been possible without you.”
She added that his conduct was “the exact polar opposite” of the good husband, parent and church member described in 50 letters to the court seeking leniency.
There seems to be “two sides to you,” Bazis said, one in business and another with friends and family.
Assistant U.S. District Attorney Don Kleine had called for a sentence of at least 97 months in prison, calling it “just punishment” for seeking to defraud “not one, not two, not 10 but over 20 financial institutions.”
Hill’s lead attorney, Pat McInerny said that comparable sentences for comparable bank fraud cases nationwide would suggest a prison sentence of 36 to 48 months.
He said the outpouring of support of Hill was the “clearest indication of what’s waiting for Mr. Hill when he’s released,” which is a life without a repeat crime.
“That sort of network you don’t often see,” McInerny said.
Hill read a lengthy written statement apologizing for his conduct to his wife, his children and his church, as his wife sat behind him in court, fighting back tears.
“I’ll be working the rest of my life to repair my reputation and make restitution,” he said.
Marshbanks, he said, slowly deteriorated into a man who worked out instead of being at home, mixed pain relievers with protein shakes and sought more and more loans to cover his losses and expenses.
But, Hill said, “I didn’t have the courage to challenge him.”
“I was severely lacking in humility, in my own life and heart,” Hill said. “I owe so many apologies.”
Bazis told Hill that the death of Marshbanks “left you holding the bag” for restitution and prison. She said that the 60-month sentence was “a variance” but was an appropriate sentence for his actions, which were “deliberate and calculated.”
The bank loans were instead used to cover investment losses, made through Hill, that were described as catastrophic in 2022, as well as to cover payments on earlier loans, according to court records.
As part of Hill’s plea deal with federal prosecutors, a $900,000 villa in Puerto Rico purchased with the fraudulent loans was seized, as was interest the pair purchased in a multi-million turboprop Pilatus airplane and proceeds deposited in an investment account. It was unclear if Hill would have to sell his $1.2 million home and acreage near Hickman.

Part of the proceeds were used by Marshbanks to begin building a multi-million luxury home and barndominium complex on the eastern edge of Lincoln, a home since sold in an attempt to pay back a portion of a bank loan.
Marshbanks’ death, and the subsequent revelations about the dozens of fraudulent loans sent shockwaves through the state banking community, throughout Lincoln and among those who knew the devout Christian.
How, people wondered, could a 6-foot-6 former star basketball player at Lincoln Christian High School, who was active in charitable causes, have fooled so many financial institutions? And why did he need so much money?
The scheme was beginning to unravel when Marshbanks, a former member of the Lincoln Christian School Board and a former star athlete at that school, was found dead inside a downtown Lincoln parking garage in November of 2022 after overdosing on a trio of drugs.
Hill, whom authorities say provided dummy financial statements to banks as collateral, was later targeted by Nebraska regulators in a lawsuit to freeze assets obtained by the pair and to stop Hill from selling financial investments.
In June, Hill agreed to a plea deal in which he admitted to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in exchange for other charges being dropped.
For the past three years, a court-appointed receiver has been looking to recover what assets might remain in the Marshbanks estate to pay back the debts to the banks, savings and loans and credit unions, which included ones in Wyoming and Louisiana.
The search has included seeking access to cryptocurrency investments made by Marshbanks. 2022 was a catastrophic year for crypto investors, with some losing almost all of their value.
The search to recover assets continues.



Not the first time
The Marshbanks case isn’t the first time Jesse Hill has faced sanctions for his investment dealings, which Judge Bazis noted on Thursday.
In 2018, Hill agreed to pay $7,500 in fines and investigation costs for failing to register with the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance as an investment advisor. The agreement was signed by then-State Banking Director Mark Quandahl.
Back then, Hill was found to have taken in pooled investments of $4 million from 47 investors through his company, JT Equity Trading. He was ordered to issue refund checks to the investors and not launch another pooled investment without registering with the state.
A state Banking Department spokeswoman told the Examiner that the agency continues to monitor the criminal case faced by Hill, but she also pointed out that neither he, nor his investment company, First SOJO Capital Group, are currently licensed in the state to sell investments.
In December 2022, the Banking Department filed a civil lawsuit to freeze Hill’s assets, assign a receiver to seek restitution for investors, and to obtain an injunction against any further violations of the state securities act.
That injunction, granted in January of 2023, remains in effect, and the civil suit is still pending.
Court records indicated that Marshbanks began suffering catastrophic losses of money due to “a highly aggressive options trading strategy” initiated by Hill.
The spokeswoman, in a statement to the Examiner, said the agency was aware that Hill was being sentenced on Thursday and continues to aid the receiver appointed by the court to seek assets to reimburse those who lost money.
The agency has several additional remedies to consider, including a permanent suspension of Hill’s ability to sell securities, according to the spokeswoman.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)States are preparing for the possibility of a rapid shift in the cost of Obamacare health plans, depending on whether Congress extends the subsidies that are at the center of the federal government shutdown.
No matter what Congress does, the amount insurers charge for coverage sold on the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act will increase by an average of 26% in 2026, according to KFF, a health research nonprofit. In the 30 states that use the federal Healthcare.gov, premiums will rise by an average of 30%. In the states that run their own marketplaces, the average increase will be about 17%.
But 22 million of the 24 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans receive a tax credit. If Congress extends the credits, the amount subsidized enrollees pay each month won’t significantly change, even as insurers charge more.
If Congress doesn’t act, people with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level will receive less financial help, while people making more than that amount will not get any help at all. As a result, according to KFF, monthly premium payments for all enrollees will increase by an average of about 114%,
For a month, Republicans and Democrats have been in a stalemate over whether to extend these subsidies, leading to a government shutdown. The situation has created ambiguity for the states that run their own marketplaces, as many of them move this weekend into the open enrollment period for people to purchase health plans.
Some states, such as Maryland, are preparing for a scenario in which they would either extend state-funded subsidies to enrollees to help them keep their plans, or rapidly apply federal subsidies if Congress extends them.
“It’s going to vary state by state based on their technological abilities and if they need to do anything with their rates,” Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, said in a phone interview.
Eberle said Maryland created a state subsidy program to make up for some of the federal subsidies that are in limbo. She said that if Congress extends the subsidies, enacting changes for the state’s 240,000 marketplace enrollees could take around three weeks.
Maryland would have to ask health insurers to resubmit their rates. The state also might have to send notices to enrollees to give them the opportunity to change their choice of plan, according to Eberle.
“We would change [enrollees’] premiums. We would have to back out the state subsidy [that we] put in, if there’s a new rate, put the new rates in, recalculate the new premium tax credit and apply that,” Eberle said.
In California, where two million people are enrolled in Covered California, residents are already reeling from sticker shock after seeing next year’s premiums on the state’s website.
“People are very stressed about what to do and what their options are with these cost changes,” Jessica Altman, executive director of California’s marketplace, said in an interview. “At the same time, we are very much ready, and we’ll move any mountain that we can possibly move if Congress does act.”
Altman said the state will automatically recalculate what enrollees would pay for their plans if Congress extends the credits, and is prepared for people to want to change their plans if federal lawmakers act.
“We’re also very much going to want to inform our consumers and give them the opportunity to make a different choice,” she said.
Altman said notifying enrollees’ of changes should take a few weeks, but changing information in the state’s system should only take about a week.
“Even when the enhanced tax credits passed the first time, it was in the middle of the year, in the spring,” Altman said.
“All the state exchanges had to build that, and it was done in a matter of weeks, right? So, that’s who we are, and that’s how we’re thinking about this challenge.”

For the first time, investment earnings beat out every other revenue stream in the state, the latest CREG report shows. 
The post Wyoming’s investment portfolio surpasses mineral industry’s contribution to state coffers appeared first on WyoFile .","For the first time in Wyoming history, earnings from the state’s investment portfolio produced the most revenue, marking a new chapter in an economy that has long relied on the mineral industry. 
That’s according to a report from the Consensus Revenue Estimating Group presented Thursday to the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee. 
Known as CREG, the group makes revenue projections each October to coincide with the governor’s budget preparations and then revises those numbers closer to the session to reflect the latest data. 
“The standout revenue performance, and the driver of a majority of the actual revenue in excess of the January 2025 CREG forecast was investment earnings,” according to the report. “Total realized investment earnings, including interest, dividends, and realized capital gains, generated an all-time record for the state.” 
In total, the state treasurer’s office realized $1.86 billion in investment earnings. That’s 25% more than Wyoming’s severance taxes and federal mineral royalties combined, CREG Co-Chair Don Richards told the committee. 
“I can’t overemphasize the amount of money that was generated from the savings of the state for this,” Richards said. “I’m not advocating or endorsing any of those policies, but I would acknowledge the prior action of the Legislature in terms of their investment policy, the savings in those funds, the increases to money management, the authorization to invest in alternatives, increasing the reserve amounts, all of this is contributing to these outsized gains.”
For years, Wyoming’s investment strategy for its large permanent funds was more cautious. Then the state — via legislation and the treasurer’s office — began to transition to a more aggressive approach. 
“This didn’t happen by accident. The work and staff I started as state Treasurer and Treasurer Meier has continued has shown its worth,” Gov. Mark Gordon wrote in a statement to WyoFile. “Wyoming made tough disciplined decisions to save rather than spend and today those decisions are real returns. Investment income becoming our top revenue source is proof that fiscal conservatism isn’t just a philosophy, it’s a strategy that works for Wyoming taxpayers.”
The transition appears to be paying off, at least for now. But Richards cautioned the committee that the results may be difficult to replicate. 
“We know just as of yesterday, short-term interest rates are declining,” Richards said. “That means our cash that is invested will earn less money. Our yields will be declining.”
Richards also noted that investments are inherently volatile.
“There is caution inherent in the achievement of this revenue source,” the report states. “That is, investment earnings, especially from realized capital gains, are extremely volatile.”
Furthermore, Wyoming’s state revenue streams as a whole are volatile. That’s something past CREG reports have pointed to. More specifically, as the state has diversified its revenue streams, it has grown more reliant on its investment portfolio as well as oil and gas production — all of which come with higher volatility than coal, which has served as a key revenue driver in the past but has seen production slow in recent years.

“This characteristic, given reliance on energy and financial markets, is unlikely to abate,” according to the most recent report. “External factors, including, but not limited to, geopolitical events, changes in energy markets and demand preferences, weather, available infrastructure, infrastructure outages, and world financial markets continue to dramatically influence fluctuations in Wyoming’s revenue.” 
Other findings 
While investment earnings are up, a few of the state’s prominent revenue sources fell short. 
“Specifically, sales and use taxes deposited into the General Fund,” which acts as one of the state’s primary checking accounts, “and state royalties deposited into the Public School Foundation Program Account both lagged CREG’s January 2025 forecast,” the report states. 
But taken together, revenue streams from the extractive industries exceeded January’s estimates, with severance taxes bringing in $22.2 million more than expected and federal mineral royalties, also known as FMRs, an additional $19.6 million. 
Earlier this year, the two chairmen of the Joint Appropriations Committee — Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, and Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton — urged Wyoming’s federal delegation to give the state a larger share of coal royalties after the Big Beautiful Bill slashed the rates. 
The delegation told state lawmakers, Bear said at the meeting, that “the administration anticipates the long-term outcome to be increased production.”
Bear asked Richards if the report took that into account and if he “anticipates more mining based on these lower FMRs and better business atmosphere.”
“Absolutely,” Richards said, adding that it will take a “considerable amount of time” to fully accommodate the reduced royalty rate. 
The report also highlighted increases in other revenue streams, including franchise taxes and corporate filing fees, and an improved credit rating for Wyoming by S&P Global Ratings. 
Last month, the agency boosted the state’s rating from AA to AA+, noting in its upgrade that “the rating action reflects our view of Wyoming’s demonstrated active budget monitoring, conservative revenue forecasting, and timely expenditure adjustments that we believe will continue to support structurally balanced financial performance, and the state’s maintenance of very high reserves that provide near term budgetary flexibility to mitigate potential revenue volatility from fluctuating energy markets or economic downturns.” 
What now?
The governor will now use the CREG report to help craft his budget proposal to the Legislature, which ultimately holds the purse strings. 
Gordon is expected to present his proposal in December, when the committee will begin its budget hearings on the first of the month in Cheyenne. The entire Legislature will convene in February to craft the next budget.

Brian Kemp continued to call on congressional Democrats to end the shutdown in a statement Thursday. Photo by Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA critical federal food assistance program that benefits roughly 1.4 million Georgians is on track to run out of funding this weekend, as the federal government shutdown approaches a full month.
Yet while governors in both red and blue states have taken steps to ease the burden on people who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, state leaders in Georgia have largely stayed quiet, with Republican Gov. Brian Kemp resisting calls from Democratic lawmakers to use state resources to keep the food assistance flowing.
In the interim, food banks and pantries across the state are preparing for an influx of visitors, many of whom could face the abrupt loss of food aid starting this weekend. 
Georgia Democrats call on governor to use state funds to keep food benefits flowing during shutdown

However, advocates worry that if SNAP benefits are cut off, local organizations may not be able to meet such a rapid increase in demand. Second Harvest of Coastal Georgia, a food bank based in Savannah that serves approximately 20,000 people each month, said it will struggle to fill the void if the shutdown continues into November.
“SNAP in the state of Georgia and across the United States provides about six meals to every one that the food bank provides,” said Mary Jane Crouch, the group’s executive director. “So realistically, we don’t have enough to be able to meet that gap for a very long period of time.”
Kelly Klein, the chief philanthropy officer at the Food Bank of Northeast Georgia, echoed Crouch’s sentiment.
“Even before the government shutdown happened on Oct. 1, we were already seeing an increased need for food,” she said. As the federal government shutdown drags on, she said she expects that food pantries will continue to feel the strain. 
Other organizations are scrambling to find  ways to tackle the growing demand for food assistance. The Atlanta Community Food Bank announced Thursday that it will draw $5 million from its reserves due to the government shutdown, increasing its distribution by nearly 85%. 
New Disabled South, a nonprofit group that advocates for people with disabilities across 14 Southern states, temporarily opened applications for direct cash assistance to SNAP recipients, allowing families to apply for one-time payments of $250, and individuals to apply for $100 in assistance. 
Dom Kelly, the organization’s co-founder, president and CEO, said that the cash payments were meant to help people with disabilities access the kinds of food they need, which are not always readily available at food pantries.
“We’re talking about people who would love to be able to go to a food bank or a food pantry to get food but unfortunately, their disability makes it harder for them to be able to eat just any food,” he said. “So much of the food that’s at a food bank or a food pantry isn’t actually good for them, whether they have celiac disease or some other type of disease.”
In the two days the application was live, Kelly added, the organization received nearly 19,000 applications, totaling more than $4 million in requested aid. Roughly 40% of those requests came from Georgia residents, he said, urging state leaders to take action.
“The state of Georgia has a $14.6 billion budget surplus,” he said, referring to the state’s reserves. “That is our money that we paid in to be able to help people that’s sitting in a savings account doing nothing.”
The governor’s office and the Georgia Department of Human Services both released statements Thursday, arguing that it would be impossible to fund the existing SNAP program using state funding, because they said the mechanism to load money onto beneficiary cards rests with the federal government. They also said that, according to the USDA, there is no provision under current law for states to be reimbursed. 
Kemp, who is currently on an overseas trade mission, continued to call on congressional Democrats to end the shutdown in a statement Thursday.
“The only way to quickly and effectively resolve this issue is for Democrats to vote to reopen the federal government immediately,” he said.

State Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, a Duluth Democrat, urged Kemp to take action during a Wednesday press conference at the state Capitol in Atlanta, arguing that he could declare a state of emergency to help address the issue.
“I know that he’s saying, well, there’s technical difficulties, but he’s the governor of Georgia,” she said. “I’m asking him to figure it out.”
She also highlighted states like Louisiana and Virginia, which have announced they will use state funding to assist SNAP recipients during the shutdown.
“We are not a state that’s in a deficit,” Islam Parkes added. “We have a surplus. We can use it, and it’s up to the governor to do so.”

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Secretary of State Cole Jester announced Thursday that his office believes there are roughly 240 alleged noncitizens on Arkansas’ voter rolls.
Thirty to 40 of those people are believed to have voted in an election, but Jester said during a press conference at the state Capitol that federal and state prosecutors would investigate to confirm the number.
The American Immigration Council estimated 161,000 foreign-born people lived in Arkansas in 2023. Of those, 52,000 are estimated to be naturalized citizens, while 72,200 are estimated to be undocumented immigrants.
Arkansas has roughly 1.8 million registered voters — meaning 0.013% of the state’s registered voters are potentially noncitizens. That aligns with similarly small percentages reported in states like Texas and Louisiana. The percentage of potential noncitizens on the state’s rolls who have voted, 0.002%, is even smaller.
Jester said he provided Arkansans’ voter registration data to the Department of Homeland Security in September. The 240 individuals — who have not yet been given the opportunity to prove their citizenship status — were identified via personally identifiable information such as the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, Jester said. Generally, only noncitizens authorized to work in the U.S. can obtain a Social Security number.
The individuals would be sent a letter Oct. 30 giving them 30 days to provide proof of citizenship, he added. If proof is not provided, Jester said county clerks will be told to “clean up their voter rolls” to ensure only citizens are registered.
“On one hand, having 240 people on your rolls who are non-citizens is a nightmare,” Jester said. “On the other hand … we don’t think this has flipped elections.”
The individuals identified as having voted have been referred to state and federal law enforcement, Jester said.
The program that identified the alleged noncitizens — the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE — was created so state governments could verify the citizenship status of those applying for government benefits. Prior to 2025, names had to be run through the system one by one. After being fed information, the system would check it against numerous government databases, such as those maintained by the Social Security Administration.
After President Donald Trump took office, SAVE’s capabilities were expanded so that large lists, such as voter rolls, could be checked en masse. Confidential Social Security data, including full Social Security numbers for millions of Americans, was also integrated into the tool.
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

This has led to questions about the security of the personally identifiable information contained in such lists, and concerns that the enhanced capabilities would enable officials to erroneously purge legal voters from voter rolls. The nonprofit investigative journalism outlet ProPublica found that there were “alarmingly few guardrails to ensure accuracy and scant specifics on how the data will be kept secure.”
Some of the databases the program relies on can be outdated and lack privacy safeguards, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. That has led to issues verifying the citizenship of certain kinds of U.S. citizens, such as the children of U.S. citizens abroad.
In response to questions by the Advocate, Jester said the federal SAVE program originally identified upwards of 300 people on the rolls as noncitizens. Some were subsequently identified as naturalized citizens whose information had not been updated in the program’s databases, bringing the number to around 240.
When asked, Jester said it was “possible” some individuals on the list had registered by accident when applying legally for a driver’s license or other program.
“We think that is one way these errors enter the system. There’s a box you have to check where you attest that you are a lawful voter, that you’re a registered citizen; that people are just checking forms, they’re not reading,” Jester said. “If you have registered accidentally, I think you’re very unlikely to have voted. If you have voted, that probably indicated something more malicious.”
Mireya Reith, executive director of Arkansas United, a nonpartisan nonprofit advocating for Arkansan immigrants, said noncitizen registrations are usually because of clerical errors. Immigrant communities, she said, are well aware of the consequences of not following the law.
“This is not something that our community actively is seeking to do because the repercussions are so great for their ability to either stay in this country or to fulfill that dream of citizenship someday,” Reith said.
Erroneous registrations frequently occurred due to paperwork snafus when applying for driver’s licenses or government programs they were eligible for, she said.
“None of this was malintentioned,” Reith said.
Reith said she was concerned legal voters could be purged from state rolls as a result of the SAVE checks, in part because last name practices in some cultures can create discrepancies in an immigrant’s official documentation.
That can result in “some confusion that will suggest that somebody is either someone that they’re not, or they’ll have a different spelling of a name, or the state agent who’s noting the name doesn’t note it exactly as it was in their citizenship paperwork,” Reith said.
She said her organization would be watching to ensure immigrants receive due process, given that “immigrants are being denied due process in many spaces.”
Jester stressed during the press conference that efforts were being made to ensure citizens are not removed from the state’s rolls by accident.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5841-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-30 18:57:15.417496

Jim Pillen can issue partisan statements.,"A sign in front of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services' Lincoln Public Assistance Office on Oct. 30, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services website posted a banner this week blaming U.S. Senate Democrats for the federal government shutdown and urging them to “stop using Nebraska’s most vulnerable people for political leverage.” 
On the banner, the state points to Democrats for disrupting the state-federal partnership on public grocery benefits, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, which it says will run out of funds by the end of the month. 
The original message followed a similar approach to the Trump administration, some GOP-led states and some Democratic-led states during the messaging battle over who’s to blame for the federal shutdown. 
Nebraska DHHS updated the banner on its website Thursday after reporters and others asked questions, tweaking the announcement from a blanket statement into essentially the same message shared as a quote from Gov. Jim Pillen. 
A DHHS spokesperson said the post was added at the Governor’s Office’s request and was updated to “eliminate any confusion” about where the statement came from. State law prohibits public resources from being used for political purposes, as critics of the banner note. On Thursday afternoon, Pillen’s office confirmed that it approved the posting.

DHHS officials and the Governor’s Office said the Republican governor has the authority to issue partisan statements on state websites. 
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, a Democrat, said the tweak to the website is an admission that he overstepped state law by authorizing the statement and is now trying to “thread the needle” with a quote from him.
“Nebraskans are rightly concerned about the disruption of SNAP benefits … and instead of finding solutions, what the governor decided to do was to create yet another distraction,” Conrad said. 
Common Cause of Nebraska officials said it was unlikely that Pillen violated state law. The national version of the same group is among legal observers who have argued the Trump administration likely violated the Hatch Act by using government websites and agencies to blame Democrats for the shutdown. That federal law limits political activities of federal employees and federal agencies to ensure government programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion. 
Criticisms grew after the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development posted messages blaming the “Radical Left” in Congress for the shutdown, in website banners similar to the initial Nebraska DHHS post. The Trump administration also inserted language in some automated email responses from federal agencies blaming Democrats.

In Democrat-led Massachusetts, a state government website has an alert saying, “President Trump is freezing SNAP benefits,” while New York’s Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance urges New Yorkers to call their representatives in Congress. 
Earlier this week, Nebraska DHHS announced that SNAP benefits for roughly 150,000 low-income recipients across Nebraska would be paused due to the shutdown. The agency also told Omaha ABC affiliate KETV that it would not take over SNAP funding by itself, because “absorbing the expense of this federal program is not sustainable.” 
Twenty-five states have sued the Trump administration over its decision that the USDA cannot use emergency funds to cover SNAP benefits in November. Several other states, such as Virginia and Rhode Island, have declared a state of emergency to reallocate state funds to cover shortfalls in the SNAP program, bolster food pantries or do both.
Texas Democrats have urged Gov. Greg Abbott to use his executive authority to provide emergency state funding. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds announced some state funding for Iowa’s food banks and pantries and activated the Iowa National Guard for food distribution. 
Pillen joined other governors in saying their states can’t cover the missing federal food aid, Pillen’s office said it has no plans to declare an emergency. Nebraska is currently dealing with a budget shortfall. 
Also on Thursday, a lawsuit was filed against Steve Corsi, the CEO of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, alleging that he violated state law by posting the message slamming the Democrats.
The posting, the article said, was also “false and misleading,” according to the lawsuit filed by Lincoln attorney Vince Powers, a former head of the Nebraska Democratic Party, on behalf of a Lincoln woman, Kay Siebler.
Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., a Democrat, the Food Bank for the Heartland, Community Alliance, and other Omaha city leaders have asked for food and monetary donations ahead of SNAP benefits being shut off.

(Image via USFS document)A federal judge told the U.S. Forest Service that a plan to kill rainbow trout and replace them with native Yellowstone cutthroat trout along a 45-mile stretch of waterways in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness violates federal law. 
U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy granted summary judgment in favor of the conservation group Wilderness Watch, which sued the Forest Service in 2023, alleging the agency’s plan violated several provisions of the Wilderness Act. 
“The Wilderness Act is not simply a procedural hurdle that can be overcome by considering all the relevant factors that bear on wilderness character,” Molloy wrote in a decision last week. “To the contrary, the Act dictates the outcome; wilderness areas ‘shall be administered for the use and enjoyment of the American people in such manner as will leave them unimpaired for future use and enjoyment as wilderness.’”
Molloy’s decision came down in opposition to findings that favored the Forest Service offered by a magistrate judge following a hearing last December, after which Wilderness Watch moved for summary judgment. 
“This is one of the most important rulings for protecting the integrity of the Wilderness Act in the law’s 60-year history,” Wilderness Watch Executive Director George Nickas said in a statement. “The idea that managers can substitute their desired conditions for what nature provides in these wild places threatens to destroy the profound values that set wilderness areas apart. Judge Molloy’s thoroughly reasoned order spells out precisely why the agency’s misguided aims are fundamentally at odds with the law. Every manager who oversees wilderness needs to read and understand it.”

The Buffalo Creek Project was a partnership between the Forest Service, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and Yellowstone National Park and would have involved 46 stream miles and 11 surface acres of a lake in the wilderness area to the north of Yellowstone Park. The project’s goal was to remove populations of non-native rainbow trout from the system, which the state had introduced nearly a century ago, and replace them with Yellowstone cutthroat. 
Under the plan approved by the Forest Service, crews would be allowed to build multiple remote field camps, use helicopters to deliver thousands of pounds of gear and fish poison rotenone into the wilderness, build and use a radio repeater in the wilderness, put fish barriers at Hidden Lake, and use the rotenone for up to five years in the creek drainage and on wetlands. 
 Up to 60 days of motorized use and up to 81 aircraft landings were approved as part of the plan, which the Forest Service cited as necessary due to the remoteness of the area. 
Wilderness Watch, a Missoula-based conservation nonprofit, said that cutthroat trout are also not native to the upper parts of the drainage, and the use of fish poison, helicopters and motorized equipment posed clear violations of the Wilderness Act. 
The project “unlawfully elevates managers’ desired outcomes above the Wilderness Act’s ‘untrammeled’ mandate,” the lawsuit stated, saying the plan authorized “a stunning amount of intensive motorized and mechanical intrusions” that are normally prohibited activities in designated wilderness. 
Wilderness Watch also argued that the decision to swap out fish species was selected because of the downstream benefits — for fisheries and recreation outside the wilderness boundary. 
“The Forest Service selected the most wilderness-degrading alternative … to pursue speculative conservation outcomes outside the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness,” court documents state. They also argue that as the Buffalo Creek watershed, among the upper reaches of the Yellowstone River system, was historically fishless, the wilderness area does not need the species for ecological balance or to preserve the wilderness character. 
Molloy also wrote in his decision that Wilderness Watch correctly argued that the Forest Service failed to consider the fish stocking portion of its plan — separately from the work to poison and remove the rainbow trout — and the potential impact on the wilderness. 
One potential alternative option for the agency to consider would have stopped after killing the nonnative rainbow trout, leaving the area bereft of trout. 
Molloy rejected the findings of Magistrate Judge Kathleen Desoto and ultimately determined that the Forest Services’ plan ran counter to the protections of the Wilderness Act. 
“Recognizing the incredible impacts these prohibited activities would have on the wilderness area, the Forest Service determined in its Minimum Requirements Decision Guide that the Project would have an overall negative impact on wilderness character,” Molloy said. “But the agency concluded that the Project complied with the Wilderness Act anyway. Because that decision ‘runs counter to the evidence before the agency,’ it is arbitrary and capricious.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-08-at-4.20.17-PM-1024x602.png,,,2025-10-30 18:57:15.417496

There have been no accidents involving e-bikes in the city, according to South Burlington Police Department data.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on Oct. 30, 2025.
South Burlington’s bicycle and pedestrian committee presented a package of recommendations regarding the use of electric bikes on shared-use paths throughout the city — a local conversation that highlights a broader discussion happening nationally.
The committee says it has received complaints in recent months about the use of e-bikes on the city’s sidewalks and recreational paths, particularly regarding speed and inconsistent appropriate warning to those walking or running.
E-bikes are generally described as having a battery-powered assist — 750 watts or less — that is activated when a user pedals, or on some bikes, uses a throttle. The pedal assist makes it easier to climb hills, go faster and farther with less effort and sweat.
Proponents of the newer technology argue that, not only does it contribute to climate resiliency by creating alternative transportation options, but it also offers increased accessibility to those who may not be able to operate bikes.
But as the popularity of these vehicles increases, the conversation around safety has been bubbling beneath the surface, especially in areas around the nation with higher-density populations. New York City, for instance, instituted a 15-mile-per-hour speed limit for e-bikes and ordered Lyft, the operator of the widely used Citi Bike program, to reduce the top speed of its electric bicycles from 18 mph to 15, according to The New York Times.
E-bikes are classified into three distinct classes that are distinguished by speed and pedal-assist capability. Class 1 is equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling and maxes out at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Class 2 bikes can propel even when the rider is not pedaling but are still limited to 20 miles per hour. Class 3 bikes have a motor that only assists when pedaling but can reach 28 miles per hour at speed.
South Burlington’s bicycle and pedestrian committee found that advocacy organizations such as The League of American Bicyclists, People for Bikes and Local Motion are typically against setting speed limits for e-bikes. Most evidence points to e-bike riders sustaining average speeds of only about two to three miles per hour faster than conventional pedal bikes, according to data from Local Motion.
Val Cyr, communication specialist for Local Motion, said that while the group has heard community concerns most of the complaints centered around what the industry calls “e-motos,” which typically go faster than an e-bike and more resemble small motorcycles. She said they are often purchased by younger people, “perhaps on a sketchy website.”
Joe Drennan, owner and operator of Earl’s Cyclery and Fitness on Williston Road, estimates roughly 60% of the people looking to purchase e-bikes are generally older.
“Most of them are cyclists that are just taking that next step. Their bodies, their health, whatever, are kind of telling them, ‘Hey, it’s time for an e-bike,’” Drennan said.
Drennan said some of the safety problems are coming from non-cyclists, like younger children, who are drawn to e-bikes because of their perceived convenience, but who may not be as familiar with the rules of the road.
“The problem is, now you mix that with an older demographic that doesn’t have the dexterity, the balance, and now these people are riding the same locations,” he said. “It’s really a recipe for disaster.”
Drennan said there appears to be a push in the industry for mass-marketed bikes in which some electronics don’t meet the safety benchmarks.
“In some of those products, some of those batteries are maybe made to a lower quality standard or whatever,” he said. “You read in the newspaper or see on the news, New York City apartment buildings burned to the ground because of e-mobility devices, not just bicycles. A lot of that is caused by misuse, mismatched batteries and chargers being charged excessive amounts.”
Similarly, Cyr at Local Motion said the fire hazards presented by the batteries cause the greatest level of concern for the advocacy group.
While South Burlington does not have an e-bike ordinance, riders still must adhere to state law — while e-bikes are generally treated as bicycles, Class 3 models are restricted to riders 16 and older, and local authorities can restrict their use on certain trails or paths.
“We have a rash of under 16-year-olds riding what I would call Class 4 bikes. They’re going 30, 40 miles per hour,” city council chair Tim Barritt said.
According to South Burlington Police Department data compiled by the committee, there have been no accidents involving e-bikes in the city. The Vermont Agency of Transportation data indicates that, within the last decade, there have been 39 crashes statewide involving electric bikes — 13 this year. The data does not show which class of e-bikes was associated with each incident, or the circumstances around the accident.
“The number of e-bikes is just going to increase, and they are going to need some serious regulation as we go forward,” South Burlington resident Ken Boyd said. “E-bikes on the sidewalk? I would never support that.”
The bicycle and pedestrian committee recommended that the city consider increased education and signage, defining micromobility devices that may be allowed on city shared-use paths and sidewalks, and implementing speed advisories, 15 miles per hour for eight to 12-foot paths, 10 miles per hour for sidewalks and potentially even lower numbers for denser areas.
The committee found that Burlington is also in the early stages of looking at possible speed advisories on its bike paths. Several towns and cities across the country have instituted similar measures.
City staff will work to put together a project plan for the recommendations, which will likely include cost estimates and implementation strategies, as the next step.
“This is not a crisis emergency,” Barritt said.

(Photo by McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake County health officials announced on Wednesday that they have identified what is likely the county’s first case of measles amid an ongoing national outbreak.
The Salt Lake County Health Department said in a news release it was alerted to the “probable” case late Monday and spent Tuesday “attempting to contact the patient to conduct a disease investigation.”
“The patient has declined to be tested, or to fully participate in our disease investigation, so we will not be able to technically confirm the illness or properly do contact tracing to warn anyone with whom the patient may have had contact,” Salt Lake County Health Department executive director Dorothy Adams said in a prepared statement.
“But based on the specific symptoms reported by the healthcare provider and the limited conversation our investigators have had with the patient, this is very likely a case of measles in someone living in Salt Lake County,” she said.
Health officials urged Utahns to “please speak” with public health workers if they contact you and “provide the information they’re seeking so they can properly investigate the situation and hopefully prevent further illness in our community.”
“Information we get during illness interviews is completely confidential, and we do not share it with anyone — including federal, state, or other local government agencies,” Adams said. “We collect the information only to investigate the source of illness and attempt to prevent further spread.”
To confirm a public health worker’s legitimacy, health officials said to check if their emails come from a .gov address, such as @SaltLakeCounty.gov. If contacted by phone, you can ask the worker to send an email from their verified .gov email address, the department said.
“They may also call a publicly listed phone number for their state or local health department (385-468-4100 for SLCoHD) and ask to be transferred to the investigator who called them,” health officials said.
 Unvaccinated people — including children too young to be vaccinated — are more likely to experience severe complications

Salt Lake County officials emphasized that measles is one of the most contagious viruses known.
“It is so easily spread that people who are not immune have a 90% chance of getting the disease if they are near an infected person,” the department said. “Someone with measles can spread it to others even before they know they are ill, and the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area.”
The best protection against the virus is vaccination — specifically, two doses of a measles-containing virus, the most common of which is the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Two doses can prevent more than 97% of measles infections, according to health experts.
In the remaining 3%, when a fully vaccinated person becomes infected with measles, symptoms are “milder, the illness is shorter and the infected person is less likely to spread the disease to others,” health officials said.
Unvaccinated people — including children too young to be vaccinated — are more likely to experience severe complications from a measles infection.
Symptoms usually start seven to 14 days after infection. They include fever, cough, runny nose, and red or watery eyes. Tiny white spots typically appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin. Three to five days after the first symptoms, a rash appears. The rash usually begins as flat, red spots at the hairline or on the face, which then spread down the body.
Many people infected with measles will experience mild symptoms, but about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people need to be hospitalized, according to health officials. Young children, pregnant women and people who have weakened immune systems are more likely to have serious problems from measles.
Salt Lake County health officials listed the following vaccine recommendations, which vary depending on age and vaccination history:

Children should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years.
Adults born before 1957 generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963.
Adults who were vaccinated before 1968 should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963 to1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968.
Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (like college students, health care workers and international travelers) should have two doses.

To learn whether you or your child needs a dose of measles vaccine, health officials urge Utahns to talk to their doctors or check their immunization records. Most Utahns’ records are available through the secure Docket app or website.
“If you’re unsure about your vaccination status and don’t have record of having received an MMR, there is no harm in getting an additional dose now,” county officials said. “ The MMR vaccine is widely available at local pharmacies, doctor’s offices or SLCoHD immunization clinics; call 385-468-SHOT to schedule a vaccination appointment at a health department clinic.”
If you suspect you may have measles or learn you have been near someone with measles, health officials urge that you contact your health care provider immediately.
“Tell them about your measles concern so they can make special arrangements to see you without putting other people at risk,” the health department said.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Environmental groups are blasting what some are calling a “premature and unlawful decision” by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to approve federal permits for the Enbridge Line 5 pipeline project in northern Wisconsin. The permits have been issued despite an ongoing court challenge to state-level permits  and before Wisconsin’s water quality certification for the project has been finalized. 
“This is a clear violation of the Clean Water Act,” said Rob Lee, staff attorney with Midwest Environmental Advocates. “It appears the Army Corps is fast-tracking a fossil fuel project at the expense of environmental protection and legal due process.”
In June, Midwest Environmental Advocates submitted formal comments during a public hearing warning the Army Corps to not approve the permits until a final water quality certification had been issued by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). A water quality permit had been issued in November but that permit  is still the subject of litigation and therefore has not been  finalized. 
“Federal law is clear,” Lee said in a statement. “The Army Corps can’t approve this project without final water quality certification from the relevant state authority. The DNR’s certification is still being challenged in court, which means it’s not legally final — and that makes this permit premature and unlawful.” 
Debra Cronmiller, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin said in a statement that the group was “horrified that the Army Corps is willing to condone an extremely dangerous project that will irreparably destroy the integrity of the watershed.” Conmiller added that  “the damage, not to mention the long term risks associated with the pipeline itself, must be considered before any such project would be granted permits to proceed.” 
Owned by the Canadian oil giant Enbridge, Line 5 is an over 70-year old  pipeline carrying thousands of gallons of crude oil from Canada into the U.S. A federal court ruled pipeline route has been trespassing on the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa’s reservation. Enbridge’s planned  reroute is also being challenged before an administrative law judge.  Advocates for the pipeline say it will generate 700  jobs and boost Wisconsin’s energy sector, while critics  argue that the pipeline’s new route would continue to threaten the Bad River watershed and other ecosystems in the event of a catastrophic oil spill. .
Clean Wisconsin has intervened in the administrative challenge to the planned pipeline reroute. “The health of these ecosystems is critical to Tribal Nations, fisheries, and local economies across the region,” said Clean Wisconsin President Mark Redsten in a statement. The group highlighted that tourism alone generates $378 million in economic activity and supports over 2,800 jobs in Bayfield, Ashland, Douglas and Iron counties.
In the past, Enbridge pipeline spills have devastated waterways and habitats. Another Enbridge pipeline leaked over 69,000 gallons of oil before the breach was noticed in late 2024, the same week environmental and trial groups filed new legal challenges of the Line 5 reroute. 
Emily Park, co-executive director of 350 Wisconsin, said the group was “deeply disturbed” by the decision. “Wisconsinites and millions of other residents of the region depend on clean and healthy water for our lives, food, jobs, and recreation,” said Park. “We are appalled that the Army Corps is willing to appease a foreign corporation by risking the health of water, the stability of our climate, and the wellbeing of current and future generations.”
By “fast-tracking the Line 5 reroute,” said Sierra Club Wisconsin Chapter Director Elizabeth Ward, “the Army Corps has backed Canadian oil giant Enbridge at the expense of the Bad River Band, Wisconsinites, and the 40 million people who rely on the Great Lakes for safe drinking water. There’s no safe way to reroute this pipeline. Every day that Line 5 continues to operate, our water, ecosystems, and way of life is in danger.”

(Getty Images stock photo)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird sent a letter to federal regulators Thursday urging an investigation into refineries that receive exemptions for renewable fuel blending standards. 
Bird, who was joined by attorneys general from Nebraska and South Dakota in the letter, said some of the small refineries that are eligible for renewable fuel exemptions are “manipulating” the program and feigning they face “disproportionate economic harm” while publicly telling investors they are “financially thriving.” 
“The possibility that refineries are gaming the system to receive government handouts when they don’t need them hurts Iowa farmers,” Bird said in a statement. “They should be investigated by the federal government to ensure that all refiners are following the rules.”

Each year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets the Renewable Fuel Standard which dictates a volume of renewable fuels that must be blended with, or must replace fossil fuels used for transportation, home heating and jet fuel. 
Fuel refiners and importers satisfy these standards by either blending renewable fuels, like ethanol or biodiesel, into their products or by purchasing credits to offset the gas they produce. 
Under the same program, EPA allows refineries that handle less than 75,000 barrels of crude oil input each day to apply for Small Refinery Exemptions. If the refinery shows it would experience “disproportionate economic hardship,” it can be exempted from complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard. 
Bird wrote in the letter that some refineries are “intentionally lowering” their production rates to meet the 75,000 barrel per day minimum and remain eligible for the exemptions. 
“In other words, certain refineries are producing less gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to enable them to ask for a government handout,” the attorneys general wrote in the letter. “That is not only contrary to the spirit of the (Renewable Fuel Standard) and (Small Refinery Exemption) programs, but it is also expressly against President Trump’s clear policy of unleashing American energy.” 
Refineries also, in an action the attorneys general noted was “even more concerning,” have “misleading representations” about the disproportionate economic hardships in their businesses. 
The small refineries can request extensions to their exemptions from the EPA with documents that demonstrate the refinery’s economic hardships. 
In August, EPA acted on a “backlog” of SRE petitions and approved 140 full and partial exemptions, while denying 28 petitions. 
A news release on the decision said EPA was “getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA’s relief should reflect those differences.” 
EPA also said it would provide updated information on how it plans for SREs in the future and said it would “seek to balance” the Renewable Fuel Standard goals to support renewable fuels, while “taking into account economic impacts.”
The attorneys general allege some of the refineries that were granted exemptions by EPA had “strong financial performance and competitive positioning” during the same time they were meant to be suffering “disproportionate economic hardship.”
“Both strong economic results and disproportionate economic hardship cannot coexist,” the letter said, following examples in public filings and quarterly reports where several refineries had positive reports. 
The letter, which was addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, U.S. Secretary of Energy Christopher Wright and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins, asks for a “cross-government” confirmation of statements made by refineries seeking the exemptions. 
For the renewable fuel industry, the exemptions mean fewer refineries are required to purchase renewable fuels, or their credits. 
Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, applauded Bird for leading the letter and efforts to bring the “potentially illegal situation to light.” 
“In a time when crop prices are low and increased biofuels usage is a key solution, it is deeply troubling to see what appears to be an attempt by some oil refiners to game the system and avoid their legal requirements under the RFS,” Shaw said in a statement.

Bob Ferguson speaks with Rachel Smith, president of the Washington Roundtable, during the Cascadia Innovation Corridor conference in Seattle, on Oct. 29, 2025. (Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Wednesday indicated that he’s reluctant to support major new tax increases in the legislative session that begins in January.
The first-term Democrat also said housing and road maintenance are two areas he plans to focus on.
“We did raise billions of dollars in revenue earlier this year, and I’m skeptical of additional revenue at this time,” he told the Standard.
His remarks come as Democratic lawmakers are in the early stages of discussing tax ideas ahead of the session, including a possible income tax on higher earners. Ferguson said he was aware of conversations about the income tax proposal but did not have a position on it.
In the spring, Ferguson signed off on more than $9 billion in tax increases over four years that Democratic lawmakers pushed through to help close a gap in the state’s operating budget. Since then, revenue forecasts have shown tax collections falling short of expectations.
Federal cuts and the economic effects of the ongoing government shutdown add another layer of uncertainty. 
It’s against this backdrop that Ferguson is crafting his first budget proposal. It is due in December and will propose tweaks to the current two-year budget.  
During remarks at the Cascadia Innovation Corridor Conference in Seattle on Wednesday, he said that housing will be one of his top priorities during next year’s 60-day session. 
Ferguson later said his proposals would include adding money to the state’s Housing Trust Fund, though he declined to provide a dollar figure. The account is the main pot of money the state uses to help fund affordable housing.
“You’ll see greater investments in housing. I’m sure of that,” he said, adding that a revenue forecast due next month could affect the final amount.
Lawmakers directed about $600 million into the trust fund in the current two-year budget approved earlier this year. That followed around $527 million in the previous biennium.
Ferguson noted that he’s working with former Gov. Christine Gregoire and talking to lawmakers about housing-related policies he may support in the upcoming session. 
Earlier this year, the governor signed a number of housing-related laws, including measures to cap residential rent increases, expand development around transit stops, allow for more splitting of residential lots, and block restrictive parking requirements.
Ferguson also highlighted growing concerns about maintenance and preservation of the state’s roads and bridges. He said the state had “done a poor job, and that’s probably an understatement,” in this area, and that his budget would propose “much greater investment.”
A state transportation official said this month the state’s road system is “in the early stages of critical failure” due to a lack of funding for upkeep. This follows similar warnings in recent years. Ferguson’s predecessor, Jay Inslee, also emphasized this was a growing problem.
“New projects are important,” Ferguson said, “but we are not taking care of our maintenance and preservation of key investments that we’ve already made. And that just has to change.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bob-ferguson-cascadia-innovation-corridor-conference-2025-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-10-30 18:16:32.480886

(Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Democratic state senators are eyeing an income tax on millionaires as they seek to overcome Washington’s persisting budget shortfall.
Individuals and households would pay a 9.9% tax on adjusted gross income above $1 million, and get credit for state capital gains tax payments, according to those familiar with the broad outline. It could generate an estimated $3 billion from a projected 20,000 households subject to the tax.
The Senate Democratic Caucus discussed the politically explosive idea, which has been repeatedly rejected by voters and the state Supreme Court, during a retreat earlier this month. They also talked about other means of raising revenues to avert deficits in the current and next budget.
Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, said Wednesday it’s too early to know if the income tax concept solidifies into legislation in the 2026 session that begins Jan. 12.
“We’ve got a lot of things being discussed and researched. I am aware of at least four or five different ideas being evaluated in various ways,” he said. “It is not the case that anybody has settled on any ideas to the point that anyone is going to introduce something.”
An income tax would not be a short-term solution to the state’s budget difficulties because it is certain to be challenged in court or on the ballot. But supporters view it as a stable revenue source for the future, and a long-sought step toward rebalancing the tax code.
Washington is among nine states nationwide that do not tax individual wage and salary income.
There would be hurdles to getting the tax passed. It would need to get through the Legislature in an election year in which all House seats and a majority of Senate seats are on the ballot. Democrats currently hold majorities of 59-39 in the House and 30-19 in the Senate.
Then Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who is not up for election, would need to be won over or at least not veto it. That’s not a sure thing after he turned down a so-called wealth tax pushed last session by Democrat lawmakers.
Ferguson said Wednesday he is “aware” of the income tax conversation but did not have a position and that, in general, he is wary of tax increases in the coming session.
“We did raise billions of dollars in revenue earlier this year and I’m skeptical of additional revenue at this time,” he said.
Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, the lead Republican budget writer, is aware too.
“It just seems the thirst for new and additional taxes from the progressives in the Washington state Legislature is never-ending,” he said. “Because they haven’t paid any price for raising taxes earlier this year. I think they are very emboldened right now.”
‘What are other things we can consider?’
Revenue streams feeding the Washington state budget are not keeping pace with the increasing cost of public services and government operations. The most recent forecast projected tax collections are more than half a billion dollars less than lawmakers counted on when they approved the budget in April.

There’s talk of needing to fill a billion-dollar gap in the current two-year budget, and an even larger one in the next.
This souring situation comes after the 2025 session in which the governor and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate plugged a $12 billion chasm with billions of dollars from new taxes and higher fees, coupled with across-the-board spending cuts.
Washington is often identified as having one of the nation’s most regressive tax codes, meaning lower earners pay a disproportionately high share of their earnings. Many progressives see an income tax as a fix, but the Washington Supreme Court has ruled that the tax is not allowed under a provision in the state Constitution.
Pedersen’s 43rd Legislative District is one of the state’s most progressive. He said Washington must find ways to spread the tax burden “more fairly” over all income brackets.
On the final day of this year’s session, Senate Democrats passed a controversial bill to impose a tax on those with more than $50 million of certain financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The bill did not come up for a vote in the House.
The legislation is still alive and, theoretically, could be voted on by the Senate early next session.
“If the wealth tax is not the answer. What are other things we can consider?” Pedersen said.
Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, who serves the same district as the senator, said he “absolutely” supports the idea of an income tax on higher earners.
“It’s very in line with what I am hearing from people in my district and around the state,” Scott said. “It’s not simply taxing the rich. Funding services are more popular and a plurality will oppose measures to cut revenue.”
The chair of the House Finance Committee, Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, said she’s working on legislation to clear up concerns with new taxes and is unfamiliar with details of the income tax idea.
“Everything is always open for discussion,” she said. “I am not aware of any similar proposal in the House.”
‘Interesting question’
Microsoft president Brad Smith smiled when asked his opinion about the potential tax during an interview on Tuesday. 
“I think it’s an interesting question,” he said.
Smith and leaders of many of the state’s largest companies actively opposed this year’s new business taxes. He said any kind of tax discussion in 2026 must be more collaborative than this year because what occurred in the last session “really divided the progressive community politically from the business community economically.”
“Certain taxes are in desperate need of reduction,” he said, citing property taxes and business taxes paid by small and family-owned enterprises. “But if we’re going to reduce some taxes, then that usually means that you’ve got to look for revenue in other places.”
Max Martin, director of government affairs for the Association of Washington Business, said he’s heard the tax discussed and would like more details.
“My head is still spinning from last session. Businesses are still trying to wrap their heads around that,” said Martin, whose focus is tax and fiscal policy. “It kind of feels like Groundhog Day.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/unnamed-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-30 18:16:32.480886

(Photo by Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)A group of retired government employees in Idaho are calling for the state to restore inflation-adjusted cost of living adjustments through the state’s pension program.
The newly formed nonprofit, called the Retired Public Employees of Idaho, says it’s hoping to strengthen the Public Employee Retirement System of Idaho, which is commonly called PERSI. 
In a news conference Thursday at the Idaho State Capitol, the group’s spokesperson, former Boise Police Chief Mike Masterson, said the state’s bumps to pension payouts for retired government employees haven’t kept up with rising living costs. 
Between 2019 and 2024, PERSI retirement benefits only rose 8% while inflation rose by more than 22%, he said. In 2023, for example, PERSI’s board has only approved a cost-of-living adjustment of around 1%, the Idaho Press reported.
“Something isn’t right,” Masterson told reporters. “A strong pension system is an investment in Idaho’s economy. 85% of retirees choose to remain in Idaho, and they receive 88% of the benefits that are paid. That money is largely reinvested in Idaho’s local and state economies.”
PERSI is Idaho’s state retirement pension program for many state and local government employees. The program serves around 78,000 people, including roughly 56,000 retirees, and has about $22 billion in funds, according to a legislative presentation late last year. 
The group of retired public employees is also calling for the Legislature to add a retired public employee to PERSI’s board, Masterson told reporters. 
PERSI could not be immediately reached for comment.

Nor does it affect the law preventing licensed recovery agents from carrying guns while on private property and during repossession activities.
That’s according to a recent legal advisory opinion offered by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier. Attorney general advisory opinions are not binding and while courts have to consider them in litigation, they don’t need to abide by them.

Uthmeier wrote in the advisory opinion in response to Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson inquiry about the McDaniels v. State ruling and whether it had any impact on how his agency regulates certain professions as part of their official duties. The First DCA opined in September that the state’s long standing ban on open carry was unconstitutional.
Private investigators in Florida must get a Class “G” statewide firearm license to carry a firearm on duty. Wilton heads the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services which processes licensure applications for those professions, a task that includes checking the applicants fingerprints, criminal history, mental health history and current mental and emotional fitness.
“McDaniels does not impact the restrictions on private investigators, security officers, and recovery agents licensed under Chapter 493, Florida Statutes, when performing their professional duties,” Uthmeier wrote in his Oct. 20 advisory opinion.  “As explained above, McDaniels only addressed Florida’s open carry ban in section 790.053, Florida Statutes, and the constitutionality thereof for ‘ordinary, law-abiding, adult citizens.’”

A three-judge panel of the Florida First District Court of Appeal ruled last month that a 1987 Florida law banning open carry was unconstitutional. 
The case was brought by Stan McDaniels, a Republican candidate for Escambia County Commission who was arrested in downtown Pensacola on July 4, 2022, with a loaded handgun tucked into his pants using an inside-the-waistband holster.
According to a police report, McDaniels was waving at vehicles with one hand with a copy of the U.S. Constitution in the other hand when law enforcement officers arrested him.
The appellate court ruled that open carry is protected under the Second Amendment and  overturned the ban.
Shortly after that ruling, Uthmeier told Florida prosecutors and law enforcement the ruling was binding on all Florida trial courts essentially declaring open carry the law of the land.
The short answer is “no”
Simpson also asked Uthmeier to weigh in on whether the McDaniels decision impacts the ban on recovery agents from carrying firearms while working on private property.
“In short, my answer to both questions is no,” Uthmeier responded. “McDaniels did not address the requirements and restrictions on private investigators, security officers, and recovery agents licensed under Chapter 493, Florida Statutes.”
Simpson in 2023 wanted the Legislature to lift the concealed weapons restriction on recovery agents working in the repossession business, the News Service of Florida reported.
However, in a footnote in his advisory opinion, Uthmeier, a Second Amendment enthusiast, said he was not addressing the constitutionality of the ban in Florida law only the impact of the McDaniel’s decision.
“In truth, I harbor doubts whether these two statutory regulations—and particularly the carry prohibition for recovery agents—would pass constitutional muster under the Bruen framework,” he said, referencing the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen.
The Bruen decision significantly expanded the scope of the Second Amendment’s protection of the right to carry firearms in public for self-defense. That case has led to a wave of more than 2,000 lawsuits against state and federal gun restrictions across the country, according to the Trace, a news site dedicated to reporting on gun violence.
“For the same reasons the Legislature apparently adopted these restrictions, including the professions’ heightened safety risks, § 493.6100, it strikes me these professionals shouldn’t be stripped of their rights to constitutional self-defense,” Uthmeier wrote. “Nevertheless, this opinion is limited to the questions presented regarding the applicability of McDaniels to sections 493.6115 and 493.6118(1)(x)(9), Florida Statutes.”

BURLINGTON — A federal prosecutor told a judge Thursday that he would pursue the death penalty against a former Stowe man charged in the 2023 fatal shooting of two Massachusetts men in Vermont. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Turner, one of the prosecutors in the case, said during the brief hearing in federal court in Burlington that U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi had “authorized” the pursuit of capital punishment for Theordore Bland, if convicted, in the double-homicide case. 
Federal prosecutors had said at the last hearing in the case in September that they were still awaiting that approval from Bondi.

Turner told Judge William K. Sessions III during Thursday’s hearing that now, having gained that approval, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Vermont would proceed with seeking a new indictment from a grand jury laying out the factors that support the death penalty in the case.
If the grand jury returns that indictment, Turner said, his office would file formal notice with the court seeking Bland’s execution, if convicted of the capital offenses. 
Bland, 30, has already been indicted on drug and firearms charges. Specifically, the indictment charges him with using and carrying “a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime causing the deaths of Jahim Solomon and Eric White in circumstances that constitute murder under federal law.”
Turner’s announcement in court Thursday regarding the death penalty comes two years after authorities found the bodies of Solomon, 21, of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and White, 21, of Chicopee, Massachusetts on Oct. 25, 2023. Searchers found the bodies in a wooded area of Eden, about a mile apart from each other. 
Both men had been fatally shot, according to state police. Authorities had been searching for them for several days after their families had reported them missing and they were last known to be in Vermont.
Prosecutors in Bland’s federal case stated in court filings that the killings occurred Oct. 12, 2023, when “Bland’s firearm discharges caused the deaths” of both men. 
Bland’s legal team includes three lawyers, with attorney Bruce Koffsky taking the leading role during Thursday’s hearing. He told the judge that they were still working to determine if the same attorneys would be representing Bland as the case proceeds.  
Koffsky declined comment following the hearing. 
Bland attended the hearing Thursday by video from a federal prison outside of Vermont. He did not appear to show any emotion when the federal prosecutor said Bondi had authorized the pursuit of the death penalty in his case. 
A co-defendant in Bland’s case, Dilan Jiron, has already entered into a plea deal with prosecutors. 
Jiron pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to possess a firearm in a drug trafficking crime and helping Bland cover up the fatal shootings. Jiron, formerly of Hyde Park, faces up to 23 years in prison when he is scheduled to be sentenced in April. 
Bondi has already approved pursuing the death penalty in another case brought in federal court in Vermont against 21-year-old Teresa Youngblut, formerly of Washington state. Youngblut has been accused of fatally shooting David Maland, a border patrol agent, in January during a traffic stop on Interstate 91 in Coventry. 
Youngblut has pleaded not guilty to the charges against her, including one for murder in Maland’s death. Youngblut has been tied to the Zizians, a loosely connected group whose members have been linked to several other homicides across the country.
The last execution in Vermont was carried out in 1954. The state does not have a death penalty statute. Bland’s case was brought under federal law, which does permit the death penalty as a punishment for certain offenses. 
Former President Joseph Biden had imposed a moratorium on seeking the federal death penalty. However, President Donald Trump lifted that moratorium in January through an executive order.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa State University)When Manu Smriti watched clothes she designed and made being modeled on a New York City runway this fall, what made her the happiest was seeing the joy and comfort of the person wearing them.
The model, 14-year-old Raffy Paulino, nicknamed Rockstar, wore a flannel shirt, yellow T-shirt and jeans — all designed with his interests and needs in mind. Rockstar uses a wheelchair and other technology for movement, Smriti said, and he loves music, gaming and the color yellow.
“I was happy seeing him happy,” said Smriti, a hybrid doctoral student at Iowa State University studying apparel, merchandising and design. “He looked happy on the runway and confident, and all the pieces were showing their functionality and aesthetic.”
ISU students and faculty helped get children with brain-related disabilities runway-ready this summer by designing garments to suit their medical, comfort and style needs. Recycling existing clothing and utilizing tools housed in the university, the designers crafted adjustable jackets with hidden vents, detachable tulle skirts and more that were sent to New York City for the “iCAN Do Anything” Fashion Show during New York Fashion Week.

Rachel Eike, an ISU associate professor of apparel, events and hospitality management, said the International Institute for the Brain (iBRAIN) reached out to her last year about partnering for the fashion show, and the timing worked out well for her hybrid summer course covering digital technologies in textile and apparel.
Before being matched by iBRAIN with a client, the students researched adaptive apparel, interviewed designers, therapists and others, sourced specialty materials and filled out a survey with their own interests and preferences. Once connected with a family, the group thrifted clothing to transform into functional and fashionable garments.
Students participating in the class were exposed to challenges they hadn’t considered before in making clothes that work for people with medical or other needs that rule out traditional clothing cuts and styles.
“I think it was just really eye-opening for the students, (to see) all the products that really are needed. I thought it was great,” Eike said. “And then it’s always fun to, you know, see your pieces worn by the individual that you’re designing for.”
Clothes are currently being sent back to ISU for students to alter, document and potentially submit to exhibitions, Eike said. The group will also develop an “open educational resource” for anyone to access that will include their methods and practices when making adaptive clothes.
Fashioning outfits to fit aesthetics as well as as adaptability 
Each of the students had different wishes and needs from the clients and their caregivers to weave into their pieces, ranging from functional to fashionable. For Smriti, that meant learning what Rockstar likes and what his mother would find helpful in dressing him.
Smriti said she crafted three garments for Rockstar’s runway outfit — jeans, a T-shirt and an overshirt. In addition to switching out old zippers for magnetic ones and adding side loops to make them easier for Rockstar’s mom to help him put on, Smriti used a laser etching machine to put Nintendo videogame characters Mario and Luigi on the tops of the legs so Rockstar could see them.
While she did create patches for Rockstar’s shirt, which said “music mode” and “game mode” for him to pick depending on his mood, Smriti said she didn’t embroider anything directly onto his clothes to avoid sensory issues. Instead she added hook and loop fasteners to the T-shirt so Rockstar could attach and remove his patches as necessary.
The Ph.D. student also modified an overshirt to have a mesh back with a flap of fabric over it in order to give him greater breathability.
In her conversations with Rockstar, who is nonverbal and communicates with gestures and through a tablet, and his mother, Smriti said what they wanted most was to have him be comfortable and happy with his clothes.
“Everybody wants to belong, and teenagers (especially), right? At that age, you want to have that contemporary fashion,” Smriti said. “You don’t want to wear baggy clothes just because they are comfortable, you want to have something to put on that makes you look presentable and represents your identity and expression.”
For Adeline Heilman, an ISU student completing her bachelor’s degree in fashion design and marketing and starting her master’s degree in apparel, merchandising and design concurrently, committing to the project meant designing an adaptive outfit fit for a princess.

Ten-year-old Cielo Chadan Cando uses a wheelchair and an abdominal feeding tube, Heilman said, and has struggled in the past to find a dress she likes that can also accommodate her needs. The ISU student ended up outfitting her with a denim dress, poofy tulle sleeves and skirt, as well as a wheelchair bag because “a princess needs a fancy purse.”
Starting with a denim dress she found, Heilman said she removed the side seams and replaced them with magnets so Cielo’s abdominal tube would still be accessible. She added snaps, hidden under decorative flowers, to attach a removable tulle skirt to the front of the dress to avoid pressure sore development. The same method was employed to add poofy sleeves to the dress, and the girl’s bag was decorated with detachable patches.
Heilman said her favorite part of watching the livestreamed fashion show was seeing how excited Cielo looked on the runway. When the clothes are returned to her, Heilman said she plans to make some alterations then send them back to Cielo.
“I also got to see pictures and videos of her opening the package for the first time, it was really awesome seeing how excited she was about both the dress and the purse,” Heilman said. “Definitely made all the work that went into this class worth it.”
Having previously worked as a certified nursing assistant and having heard it from others, Heilman said she was aware before taking the course that adaptive clothing can be prohibitively expensive for people with disabilities, and it is hard to find outside of major cities. This gave her a passion for adaptive fashion, she said, and led her to taking Eike’s course.
However, she said she still came into the course thinking that there could be a one-size-fits-all solution to the need for adaptive clothing. Working with Cielo to meet her needs showed her differently. Both she and Smriti said people with physical or medical needs deserve to have someone with empathy help make their clothing fit all of their needs.
“I feel like this class really taught me how much specific solutions are needed for each person who may need adaptive fashion, and how important it is for these people to have access to tailors or seamstresses who understand adaptive fashion and can give them those specific changes needed for their daily lives.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Kentucky’s utility regulator is granting permission to the state’s largest electric utility to build two new natural gas-fired power plants costing billions of dollars to meet a potential surge of power demand from prospective data centers seeking to locate in the state. 
The Kentucky Public Service Commission in a Tuesday order wrote that Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities (LG&E and KU) demonstrated there is a market for power demand from data centers “in the immediately foreseeable future” large enough to make economic sense to allow for the construction of the gas-fired turbines. 
The PSC — which is made up of three commissioners appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Kentucky Senate — also wrote in its 171-page order that while there is not “absolute certainty” that power demand from data centers will materialize, the electricity utility showed there is a “reasonable basis” that “economic development load is coming.” 
Investor-owned LG&E and KU estimate the cost of the two combined-cycle gas-fired combustion turbines, each with a capacity of 645 megawatts, to total $2.798 billion in construction costs and related transmission work. One is to be sited the Mill Creek Generating Station in Jefferson County and the other will be at the E.W. Brown Generating Station in Mercer County. Utilities such as LG&E and KU are guaranteed a “return on equity” or a set amount of profit approved by the PSC from their rate base, with investments the utilities make into power plants playing a significant role in costs collected from ratepayers.
 The utility, which serves more than 1 million customers with electricity and gas in the state, previously said the new power plants were needed to meet “unprecedented” projected electricity demand from prospective data centers looking to locate in the state. It’s a trend seen across the country due to a proliferation of power-intensive data centers supporting online services including artificial intelligence. 
“These generation projects help ensure we continue to safely and reliably serve all customers and new economic development growth in the lowest reasonable cost manner,” said LG&E and KU president John Crockett in a statement. 
The commission largely approved a settlement agreement proposed by several parties that intervened in the request to build the power plants, including the Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, the Kentucky Coal Association, Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers and the Southern Renewable Energy Association. 
But not all aspects of the settlement were approved. The PSC did not grant a request to extend the life of a coal-fired power plant unit at the utility’s Mill Creek Generating Station beyond an approximate retirement date of 2027, writing it did not believe “it has the authority” under its current statutory framework. The GOP-controlled state legislature in recent years has passed laws specifying the conditions under which it can grant a utility’s request to retire a fossil fuel-fired power plant, generally making it significantly harder to retire such power generation.
The PSC also denied proposed mechanisms to recover costs associated with one of the new gas-fired power plants and an existing coal-fired power plant unit, writing that LG&E and KU could potentially propose those mechanisms again in the future. 
Byron Gary, an attorney for the environmental legal group Kentucky Resources Council, represented a coalition of groups that did not agree to the proposed settlement agreement and were strongly concerned about ratepayers bearing the burden of costs of gas-fired power built for data center projects that may not ultimately be located in Kentucky. 
A number of Kentuckians including some local elected officials testified to the PSC in August that the power plants could harm the climate, public health and burden ratepayers with costs. 
“We’re disappointed that the commission has approved additional fossil infrastructure to feed speculative load growth,” Gary said. “But we did see some bright spots in their opinion, and we did value that in their attempt to balance some very difficult and very disparate competing interests.” 
Gary specifically pointed to how the commission wrote about the difficulty LG&E and KU faces when determining which economic development projects, and their large power demand, will ultimately come to fruition. The commission wrote the utility had assigned various probabilities on the likelihood of various projects materializing. But the regulator found it “troubling” that the utility “did not provide evidence concerning how those probabilities were assigned.” 
The commission urged LG&E and KU to put together a more transparent, evidence-based methodology to calculate the potential power load of prospective projects, including data centers, located in Kentucky. 
“These same data centers that are calling and inquiring with LG&E, and therefore getting added to their economic development queue, were calling five, 10 other utilities. They’re shopping around,” Gary said. “We’re not sure yet which one of those five or 10 different utilities will be the one that ultimately serves any one of these data centers.” 
The commission’s order also mentions testimony from Stacy Sherwood, a consultant with Energy Futures Group hired by the Sierra Club, that found residential electricity bills would increase significantly if the power plants are built but the data center power demand doesn’t materialize. Kentucky Utilities residential customers could see an increase of $23.05 per year, and Louisville Gas and Electric residential customers would see an increase of $138.07 per year, according to Sherwood.
Gary also said the commission was put in a difficult position by the utility’s request to build the power plants, presenting the gas-fired power as an “emergency situation” when the utility could have planned in advance with a wider range of options through demand-side management or adding more renewable energy.  The wait times and costs for gas-fired turbines across the country have increased significantly with the surge in nationwide power demand, stretching up to seven years depending on the model of turbine. LG&E and KU agreed to pay $25 million to General Electric to reserve a “manufacturing slot” for one of its proposed gas-fired turbines.
The commission also opened up a separate case to monitor the construction and costs of one of the proposed gas-fired power plants LG&E and KU requested to build, serving as additional safeguards so that ratepayers “will not be harmed by the unnecessary construction” of the plant if power demand from data centers does not materialize.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The network outage that downed a host of South Dakota state government systems in August was caused by mislabeled wiring in a room full of routers at the Department of Transportation building in Pierre, lawmakers learned Thursday.
The mislabeling ultimately led to the torching of a critical, $80,000 network traffic controller switch and its backup. State computer systems, including those used by the courts, local registers of deeds, auditors and treasurers offices and, for a short time, the state radio system, were down for nearly two business days.
Two leaders of the team that manages the data center in Pierre told members of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee that the state plans to relabel the wiring correctly, update its redundancy plans and work with state agencies on backup power schemes for the most critical state services. 
Given the disruptions this summer, lawmakers said, the state’s citizens need to be sure that work will get done. 
“On the farm, we always have extra fuses. We always have extra switches. We always have extra everything,” said Rep. Julie Auch, R-Yankton. “Are you going to have extra switches on hand or extra parts on hand so this doesn’t happen again?”
Overpowered switches
The mislabeled wiring issue came to light after the scheduled weekend replacement of a piece of equipment called an uninterrupted power supply, according to Darin Seeley, commissioner of Human Resources and Administration.
As the system was being brought back online, a main breaker tripped several times, which is “not uncommon,” Seeley said. 
Component failure in Pierre caused state government communications shutdown

The breaker’s job is to modulate the power coming into the data center from a transformer, reducing it to the level needed to operate the equipment inside. 
The breaker was damaged so badly, however, that it eventually gave out entirely, causing the initial network outage. 
The electricians who replaced that breaker turned off the main power supply to the room, Seeley said. Or at least they thought they did. Assuming that doing so would cut off power to everything else, they got to work. Unbeknownst to them, Seeley said, the two critical network switches were connected to a different breaker.
That breaker was designed to be connected to the main breaker and was labeled to say so, Bureau of Information and Telecommunications Commissioner Mark Wixon said.
“Turning off the main breaker should have turned off the power,” to the switches, Wickson said. “That wasn’t the case.”
As a result, the switches took on 10 times the power they’re meant to and burned up, one after the other.
It took a day to get a new switch from Louisville, Wixon said. Bureau staff picked it up at the airport in Pierre and had it installed around eight hours later.
Redundancies, disaster planning
Seeley told lawmakers that the building with the mislabeled wires had been “updated numerous times” over the past 50 years. 
Rep. Karla Lems, R-Canton, asked Seeley what’s been done “to make sure, ‘OK, we got everything labeled correctly.’”
He said the intent is to “try and redraw all of the lines” to make sure everything’s set up as designed, but that hasn’t happened.
Power outages across South Dakota government stymie services statewide

“It has to be done when everything’s off, because we’re talking about some pretty significant power,” Seeley said, adding that such a scheduled outage needs to be done “planfully.”
Auch wanted to know if the bureau had considered adding a third $80,000 switch to its supply, given how impactful the situation was. But Wixon said such a move had never felt necessary.
“This is really kind of the first time this type of an event, where the routers were damaged, that’s happened in over 50 years,” Wixon said. “So we have high confidence that the lessons learned around this one are being applied.”
The situation has also sparked “strategic” conversations on resilience, Wixon said.
Sen. Mark Lapka, R-Leola, wanted to know if that thinking involved the contemplation of “geo-redundancy, to have a backup in another location.”
That’s part of the discussion on disaster management, Wixon said. But building out a separate infrastructure to create what he called a “high availability level” doesn’t come cheap.
“Going through that type of exercise really does drive to ‘what is the cost of high availability?’” he said.
That expense leads most companies to prioritize which systems need to be highly available, he said, and which can survive “a three-day outage.”
The bureau plans to work with other state agencies in the coming months to determine such a hierarchy. The bureau is already working with the Department of Public Safety on a cloud-based system to make sure state radio communications, which were impacted by the August incident for approximately five hours, are protected from an outage.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The American Civil Liberties of Kansas filed a federal lawsuit Thursday challenging decisions of judges in Johnson County District Court to order probation based on whether a defendant can pay restitution to victims.
ACLU of Kansas and the law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher filed a petition on behalf of four Kansas plaintiffs, who applied to represent a class of people in Johnson County and across the state. The suit argued the state of Kansas, Attorney General Kris Kobach and six district court judges in Johnson County were complicit in constitutional violations by linking probation for some people to an ability to pay restitution, even when those defendants were compliant with all other court requirements.
Monica Bennett, ACLU of Kansas legal director, said protection from arbitrary and unequal treatment under the law was a fundamental right under the U.S. Constitution.
“There is nothing about being poor that means you should be treated differently when serving a probation term, but it’s apparent that if our clients and many other Kansans were simply able to pay, their rights would be restored,” she said.
The lawsuit alleges Kansas Statute 21-6608(c)(7) was unconstitutional because it allowed an elevated punishment of poor defendants than it did defendants who committed identical offenses but had the ability to pay court-ordered restitution. The Kansas Legislature adopted probation period ceilings for Kansans, with the exception of individuals unable to pay restitution.
In a series of cases identified by attorneys for the plaintiffs, Kansas judges extended probationary terms for Jeffrey Englund, Alicia McKnight, Debra Nicole Rice and Alanna Carter for years longer than the period prescribed in criminal statute.
McKnight has been on probation in Johnson County since 2016, while Carter and Rice have remained on probation since 2018. It wasn’t clear whether Englund was still on probation.
When probation was extended due to failure to pay restitution, the lawsuit said, all terms of probation were extended. That included provisions allowing searches of a person without a warrant. People on probation in Kansas also must report their movement in or out of the state, cannot dine or visit places serving alcohol and cannot participate in the democratic process by voting.
“Were they simply wealthier, they would be allowed to eat in the same restaurants as other people, vote like other people, and visit family in other states like other people — but they can’t while on probation,” Bennett said. “Our clients can jump through all of the hoops, stay out of trouble, be good employees and contribute to their communities for years, but the state and Johnson County judges have deemed that compliance irrelevant. Instead, their wealth or lack thereof determines their freedom.”
Micah Kubic, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas, said indefinite probation for low-income Kansans, who otherwise would be eligible to vote, served as a poll tax. Historically, a poll tax was used to disenfranchise Black people and poor white people. The practice was banned in federal elections in 1964 with the 24th Amendment to the Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court ended poll taxes in all elections in 1966.
“Democracy is inherently about whose voices we believe are worthy of including and who gets a seat at the table,” Kubic said. “This probation scheme condemns people to lose their seats and their voices simply because of the money in their pockets. That is antithetical to our Constitution and to our values as a free country.”
In addition to the state attorney general, the lawsuit named as defendants current or former Johnson County District Court Judges James Droege, Michael Joyce, Neil Foth, Brenda Cameron, Christina Dunn Gyllenborg and Sara Welch. The petition identified as defendants the Kansas Office of Judicial Administration and a debt collection company, Butler and Associates.
The plaintiffs asserted that when Kansas judges extended their probation solely for the purpose of collecting restitution — a debt owed to private victims — the court took on the role of a de facto debt collector instead of an overseer of justice.
The lawsuit also claimed judges required probationers to remit restitution payments to a debt collection agency, which added administrative fees and interest that must be paid before a person was discharged from probation. This discretionary imposition of third-party collection deprived probationers of a reliable means to understand the total amount necessary to get off court supervision, the lawsuit said.
The ACLU of Kansas alleged the state violated due process, right to travel, equal protection and right to privacy provisions of the U.S. Constitution. In addition, the lawsuit raised 13th Amendment claims regarding slavery. In terms of the Kansas Constitution, plaintiffs claimed the probationary practice violated rights of individuals in terms of voting, cruel and unusual punishment and of unreasonable searches and seizures.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Micah-Kubic-ed-ACLU-Kansas-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-30 18:01:35.980694

State and local officials are kept in the dark by limited information on deportations, the report noted, whether or not they support the administration’s mass removal agenda. 
There were 685,000 total deportations in fiscal year 2024 under Biden compared with the 600,000 projected by the Trump administration for this calendar year, the report states. 
Under pressure, some immigrants are leaving American dreams behind

During the 2025 fiscal year that ended in September, there were about 340,000 deportations, the report estimates, including both orders of removal and people choosing to end detention with voluntary departure. The Trump administration has projected 600,000 deportations for this calendar year, well short of an earlier goal of 1 million. 
Unauthorized migration at the border “plunged dramatically” from 2.1 million to 444,000 border encounters in the past fiscal year. Migrants also returned to a former pattern: People crossing the border were mostly single men from Mexico and children from Central America, after a previous surge of border crossers from around the world, the report states.
At the same time, news reports indicate that thousands of migrants who were headed for the U.S. border have reversed course and headed back through the Panamanian jungle to reach South America again. 
The lower level of border activity has made it possible for U.S. officials to send border patrol agents to cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, the Migration Policy Institute report says. 
“The steep decrease in unauthorized arrivals at the border and return to nationalities that are easier to turn back because of existing repatriation agreements has permitted the administration to direct its focus to immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior,” the report states. 
For the first time since at least 2014, deportations from inside the United States outnumbered apprehensions at the border. 
The report noted that the administration has not updated many statistics that would help show trends. 
“It has become increasingly complicated to track results because only selective statistics have been made public,” the report stated. 
“Returning to regular reporting of detailed data on immigration enforcement across the various Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration agencies could not only improve the public’s understanding of current immigration enforcement activities but also inform state and local stakeholders who want to collaborate or who are affected by enforcement,” it said.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Department of Human Services on Sunday will begin furloughing 2,300 employees as a result of the federal government shutdown, the agency said.
Employees earning a salary of $100,000 or more will be furloughed three days per pay period while those earning $50,000 up to $100,000 will have two furlough days.
Those earning less than $50,000 are exempt.
“This was an extremely difficult decision, and we recognize the hardship it places on our staff,” the agency said in a statement. “The furlough plan is structured to maximize limited resources while prioritizing the protection and engagement of frontline staff.”
The agency pays its employees biweekly.
“Oklahoma Human Services exists to provide critical services to our most vulnerable neighbors,” the agency’s statement said. “Unfortunately, the ongoing federal shutdown has significantly impacted our ability to fulfill that mission without taking actions such as this.”
The shutdown began Oct. 1 after Congress did not pass appropriations legislation for 2026 federal fiscal year. 
Democrats are asking that Republicans restore Affordable Care Act tax credits to those who face significant increases in health insurance without them. Republicans support legislation that temporarily keeps the government open through Nov. 21.
Republicans and Democrats blame each other for the shutdown.
The shutdown is expected to force the Oklahoma Department of Human Services to suspend the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly called food stamps, effective Saturday. It will impact 684,600 Oklahomans who use it to buy groceries.
The Oklahoma Department of Human Services is the only agency which has submitted a furlough plan to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, said Christa Helfrey, a spokesperson.
Maria Chaverri, a spokesperson with the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, said her agency is assessing the situation and no decisions have been made.
The Oklahoma State Department of Health is also monitoring the situation, said Erica Rankin, a spokesperson.
“No furloughs or staffing cuts within the agency are planned at this time,” she said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Supreme Court will decide whether state regulators acted correctly to fine backers of a failed election reform ballot measure more than $94,000 for a variety of alleged campaign finance violations.
In the process, it may determine whether the backers of ballot measures are required to disclose the true source of money donated to ballot measure campaigns.
On Wednesday, the court’s five justices heard oral arguments in an appeal brought by Alaskans for Honest Elections, the Ranked Choice Education Association, Arthur Mathias and Wellspring Ministries.
The four plaintiffs were supporters of a 2024 effort to repeal the state’s system of open primary elections and ranked choice general elections. That effort failed by a narrow margin, but the plaintiffs were accused of a variety of illegal practices during the election, including an alleged attempt to funnel campaign money through a church in Washington state.
An Anchorage Superior Court judge upheld the fines in 2024, and the plaintiffs appealed again to the Alaska Supreme Court. 
Former Alaska Attorney General Kevin Clarkson argued the case for Alaskans for Honest Elections, contending that the Alaska Public Offices Commission — which regulates campaign activity — improperly applied state law, incorrectly determined that Mathias made an illegal contribution, and that even if he did break the law, he is protected by the First Amendment.
One of the key issues in the case is whether Alaska’s prohibition against making a political donation in the name of another person applies to ballot measure campaigns as well as candidate campaigns.
In written filings, Clarkson said it does not, and if it did, that would violate the First Amendment. Attorneys representing the Public Offices Commission say the requirement does apply, and that the rule is valid even under the First Amendment.
Intervening in the case on the side of state regulators is Alaskans for Better Elections (ABE), the group that backed a 2020 ballot measure that installed Alaska’s existing elections system and a legal requirement that political candidates reveal the “true source” of the money they receive.
Under state law, ABE argues, a political donor cannot secretly give money to a nonprofit, which then donates in their name. While the donation can take place, the nonprofit must disclose the true source of the money.
Not so, Clarkson said, citing the preface of the 2020 ballot measure.
“It specifically says it’s directed at candidate elections,” he told the justices.
During oral arguments Wednesday, Clarkson acknowledged a large donation by Mathias to the Ranked Choice Education Association, which was formed as a church in Washington state. 
The Association did donate money to Alaskans for Honest Elections, which campaigned in 2024, but Mathias’ money was comingled with other money, Clarkson said, and so it is a mistake to claim his money was what went to the campaign group.
Assistant Attorney General Kimber Rogers, representing the Public Offices Commission, said the intent, not the action, is what matters under state law.
“The point is that (Mathias) intended to pass $90,000 through the (Ranked Choice Education) Association to the initiative group. He got the money all comingled in an account, but what’s important is his intentions,” she said.
Repealing Alaska’s system of open primary elections and ranked choice general elections is a top priority of social conservatives and the Alaska Republican Party, which is pursuing a different repeal effort for the 2026 statewide election.
Though Republicans tended to back the 2024 repeal attempt as well, Clarkson’s arguments have gotten a boost from a powerful progressive group, the 907 Initiative.
In a friend-of-the-court brief, the 907 Initiative argues that the state’s disclosure requirements “were only intended to apply to candidate elections” and should not apply to ballot measures. The Initiative also sides with Clarkson’s First Amendment arguments, saying that campaign finance disclosure rules like Alaska’s should be subject to First Amendment analysis “because they directly target political speech.”
No one from the 907 Initiative argued in person at Wednesday’s hearing.
At the conclusion of Wednesday’s arguments, Chief Justice Susan Carney said the court will take the case under advisement and issue a written decision later.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/240206-court-cases-copy-1024x556.jpg,,,2025-10-30 18:01:35.980694

The program got a $300 million infusion from USDA to keep it running through October. But as November approaches, advocates are calling on President Donald Trump’s administration to provide additional emergency funds.Some states are working to cover the funding shortfall for SNAP recipients. Tribal nations are as well, Harris said Wednesday.“We must further subsidize to provide for the failure of our federal partners to meet their trust and treaty obligations,” she said.“It’s also important to recognize, too, that tribal nations, we already face long-standing and continuing challenges with providing access to healthy and nutritious food for our citizens, and the challenges contribute to health and educational and overall wellness disparities across all of our tribal communities,” Harris added. Deciding between ‘fuel and food’Ben Mallott, president of the Alaska Federation of Natives, said that without SNAP and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, “our communities and tribal citizens will have to decide between fuel and food.” LIHEAP helps assist low-income families with energy costs and is managed under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The program has faced funding uncertainties and disruptions due to the shutdown. Mallott, who leads the largest statewide Native organization in Alaska, noted that “in some of our communities, elders are there alone and might not have family to help them with food security.” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the Senate committee, said concerns about “food versus fuel” are “very real when we talk about food insecurity.” The Alaska Republican also pointed to a major typhoon that hit her state earlier in October and its impacts on food supply. “We have heard and seen the pictures of the loss from the Typhoon Halong, and you see devastation within the village,” Murkowski said. “But the part of it that is really heartrending is when you see freezers that have been stocked with subsistence foods ... all that had been gathered that would take these families through the winter that now is lost because there’s no power in these villages, and so their food source for the winter is gone.” Coupled with the reliance on SNAP, Murkowski said “this is a point that for many in Alaska is tangibly real and tangibly frightening, and so, everything that we can do to make sure that SNAP and WIC funding is able to proceed, I think, has got to be a priority for us.”Impacts on tribal nations in Minnesota, Nevada Other senators on the panel highlighted the consequences of funding for nutrition programs running out for Native communities in their states.Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that 200 families living in the Duck Valley Indian Reservation would “lose access to essential food support.”In response, the “tribe is preparing to rely on traditional practices such as hunting elk to feed their members,” adding that “it’s important to highlight how serious of an issue this will become,” she said.Sen. Tina Smith, a Minnesota Democrat, said she’s hearing from tribal nations in her state about people switching from SNAP to another USDA program, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, or FDPIR.“I’m hearing from Minnesota tribes that there’s kind of switching happening right now, as people are trying to figure out where is the best place to be able to get stable sources of nutrition assistance for folks on tribal lands,” she said.FDPIR provides food “to income-eligible households living on Indian reservations and to Native American households residing in designated areas near reservations or in Oklahoma,” according to USDA. Households are not allowed to participate in both SNAP and FDPIR in the same month. The agency said average monthly participation for FDPIR in fiscal 2023 included 49,339 people. “People are in the midst of sort of trying to figure out how to change their benefits,” Smith said.She added that this came on top of massive cuts to SNAP in Trump’s signature tax and spending cut package he signed into law earlier this year.",,,,2025-10-30 18:01:35.980694

But as November approaches, advocates are calling on President Donald Trump’s administration to provide additional emergency funds.Some states are working to cover the funding shortfall for SNAP recipients. Tribal nations are as well, Harris said Wednesday.“We must further subsidize to provide for the failure of our federal partners to meet their trust and treaty obligations,” she said.“It’s also important to recognize, too, that tribal nations, we already face long-standing and continuing challenges with providing access to healthy and nutritious food for our citizens, and the challenges contribute to health and educational and overall wellness disparities across all of our tribal communities,” Harris added. Deciding between ‘fuel and food’Ben Mallott, president of the Alaska Federation of Natives, said that without SNAP and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, “our communities and tribal citizens will have to decide between fuel and food.” LIHEAP helps assist low-income families with energy costs and is managed under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The program has faced funding uncertainties and disruptions due to the shutdown. Mallott, who leads the largest statewide Native organization in Alaska, noted that “in some of our communities, elders are there alone and might not have family to help them with food security.” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the Senate committee, said concerns about “food versus fuel” are “very real when we talk about food insecurity.” The Alaska Republican also pointed to a major typhoon that hit her state earlier in October and its impacts on food supply. “We have heard and seen the pictures of the loss from the Typhoon Halong, and you see devastation within the village,” Murkowski said. “But the part of it that is really heartrending is when you see freezers that have been stocked with subsistence foods ... all that had been gathered that would take these families through the winter that now is lost because there’s no power in these villages, and so their food source for the winter is gone.” Coupled with the reliance on SNAP, Murkowski said “this is a point that for many in Alaska is tangibly real and tangibly frightening, and so, everything that we can do to make sure that SNAP and WIC funding is able to proceed, I think, has got to be a priority for us.”Impacts on tribal nations in Minnesota, Nevada Other senators on the panel highlighted the consequences of funding for nutrition programs running out for Native communities in their states.Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that 200 families living in the Duck Valley Indian Reservation would “lose access to essential food support.”In response, the “tribe is preparing to rely on traditional practices such as hunting elk to feed their members,” adding that “it’s important to highlight how serious of an issue this will become,” she said.Sen. Tina Smith, a Minnesota Democrat, said she’s hearing from tribal nations in her state about people switching from SNAP to another USDA program, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, or FDPIR.“I’m hearing from Minnesota tribes that there’s kind of switching happening right now, as people are trying to figure out where is the best place to be able to get stable sources of nutrition assistance for folks on tribal lands,” she said.FDPIR provides food “to income-eligible households living on Indian reservations and to Native American households residing in designated areas near reservations or in Oklahoma,” according to USDA. Households are not allowed to participate in both SNAP and FDPIR in the same month. The agency said average monthly participation for FDPIR in fiscal 2023 included 49,339 people. “People are in the midst of sort of trying to figure out how to change their benefits,” Smith said.She added that this came on top of massive cuts to SNAP in Trump’s signature tax and spending cut package he signed into law earlier this year.",,,,2025-10-30 19:17:33.137306

(Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Providence School Board says it’s on track to complete the first of two years of professional development training to comply with the most important condition for taking back control of the city’s schools next year.
The Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) insists that is too early because there is much more to be done to turn around the Providence Public School District (PPSD), which the state took over in 2019 after years of underperformance and poor learning conditions. In 2024, the takeover was extended for a maximum of three years, up through 2027. 
The district’s “[h]istorically dysfunctional and unfocused governance” continues despite some improvements, according to a PowerPoint state education officials presented Tuesday to the state’s Council on Elementary and Secondary Education.
“We are not on track today to support accelerated return to local control,” RIDE Deputy Commissioner Drew Echelson told the K-12 council. 
That “accelerated return” would essentially see the city get its school district back as early as summer 2026, the target date of the Providence school district’s local governance — which includes the School Board, the City Council, and Mayor Brett Smiley. 
“The City is still prepared for the State intervention to end in 2026,” Josh Estrella, a spokesperson for Smiley, said over email Wednesday. “We share RIDE’s commitment to making sure all partners are fully prepared and ready to govern on the first day the district returns to local management.”
But for now, RIDE favors returning the district to local control in 2027 as the more judicious option.
“There’s been a lot of progress, and we just cannot slip back,” RIDE Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green told the K-12 council Tuesday. “When we spend time on adult issues that do not benefit the district and everybody that’s doing the work in the district — that is problematic. We will always call that when we see it.”
Coaching underway
To resume local control, the school board needs to spend two years with a “Student Outcomes-Focused Governance” coach, per RIDE’s terms, as outlined by Infante-Green back in February.
The set of conditions for a return to local control include metrics related to funding, facilities, and progress made on the takeover’s guiding document, the Turnaround Action Plan. They also include building the school board’s capacity, plus a broader mandate of “Collaboration and Communication” across the district’s multiple stakeholders in hopes of creating “effective systems and structures for cross governance,” according to a RIDE news release.    
Estrella said the mayor’s office is pleased with the progress the school board has made working with its Washington, D.C.-based consultants Council of the Great City Schools.

The formal start to the school board’s work with the consultants began at its March 19 meeting, when members voted to proceed with a one-year engagement worth $50,000 and financed by the Rhode Island Foundation. Funding for the contract beyond the first year will likely require a new vote and different funding source, according to the district’s legal counsel. 
The process was not without hiccups: Providence School Board President Ty’Relle J. Stephens was the only board member who voted against the contract at that March meeting, citing concerns about the agreement, including a discount of $10,000 off the Council of the Great City Schools’ services but only if the vote to approve the contract was unanimous.
Since then, the board has had community listening sessions and numerous coaching sessions. Stephens said the board has been satisfying its end of the bargain. That’s why he was frustrated by RIDE’s presentation Tuesday, especially slide number 15 in particular.
The slide’s subtitle: “The Board has made progress in some areas, but persistent challenges threaten real progress and begs an essential question, ‘Will momentum continue?’” 
The slide states that the school board “still has not formally established final goals and guardrails” during its work with the Council of the Great City Schools. It adds that community listening sessions held over the summer did not adequately include family feedback. 
While the school board discussed its guardrails at its Oct. 22 meeting, the document was still in draft form and the board slightly behind the timeline it set in April. The board was supposed to have already finalized its guardrails and adopted one of them already.
RIDE officials are concerned about the board’s decision to retain its own legal counsel separate from the district, as well as its overturning three of the superintendent’s recommendations regarding personnel.
“Past board votes have required intervention by Commissioner to avert millions of dollars of financial risk and educators in classrooms who school administrators believed to be unfit,” the RIDE presentation says.  
Speaking during the public comment portion of Tuesday night’s K-12 council meeting, Stephens said the expectations outlined in February 2025 had been “clear” and that the board had worked with a “student outcome-focused vendor” as RIDE requested as well as the community to begin establishing the guardrails RIDE wants. 
“We have done that and more,” Stephens said. “Mid-December, the Providence School Board would have met each of these benchmarks, [and] completed over 40 hours of intense professional development, more than any school committee in the state of Rhode Island.”
“We have held 19 community listening sessions across every region in the city of Providence, developed internal drafts of goals and guardrails, and begun updating more than 100 outdated policies for the first time in years,” Stephens added. “Some policies dated back to 1970. As we approach the finish line, it is disappointing to see slide 15 presented in a way that does not fully or fairly capture the work that has been done, nor does it align with the original readiness criteria from the commissioner.”

Governor informed of ‘the situation’
RIDE’s presentation was posted online publicly last Friday. On Tuesday morning, Stephens made a preemptive strike, sending a one-page statement to the news media, floating the idea of holding a special board meeting next week to craft a formal response to RIDE’s presentation. The response would be sent to Gov. Dan McKee and the General Assembly and seek to “clear the record and ensure honest and transparent public documentation,” he wrote.
“The Commissioner appears to be altering the terms of governance readiness by introducing new conditions that are either legally questionable or misleading,” Stephens wrote in the statement. “This shift seems intended to advance a narrative of ‘dysfunctional governance’ to hopefully influence the K-12 Council to petition the Governor for extended state control.”
Stephens wrote that his conversations with McKee have been productive, and that the governor “publicly committed during his February 10, 2025, press conference that once the original expectations are met, local control will be restored. This means, Providence Schools will return to local control no later than June 30, 2026.”
By Wednesday, Stephens reversed course and wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current that he had shelved his plans to hold a special board meeting and formalize a letter on the RIDE presentation’s claims. 
“I have spoken with RIDE on this, and we’re looking forward to collaborating and working toward progress for all Providence students,” Stephens wrote.
Pressed for more specifics on what prompted the change of opinion, Stephens wrote back on Wednesday, “Since the release of that letter, there have been deep and candid conversations on all sides. Feedback was shared openly, and as a result, we are in a much stronger position to collaborate than ever before.”
“At this time, I believe it is in the best interest of the Providence School Board to remain fully focused on student achievement,” Stephens wrote. “A special meeting will not be needed as we continue working toward meaningful progress and an accelerated return to local control.”
McKee’s office never officially received the letter, according to his spokesperson Olivia DaRocha, although she said the office was informed of “the situation” by RIDE.
“We are pleased that since the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education meeting, there has been ongoing, collaborative communications between RIDE and the Providence School Board,” DaRocha wrote.
Victor Morente, a RIDE spokesperson, pointed to a video of Tuesday’s meeting when asked for comment, and added that “RIDE officials acknowledged that the District is making meaningful progress, especially in key areas such as academic achievement…However, persistent challenges remain that could hinder the District’s momentum. RIDE remains committed to working collaboratively with all stakeholders to continue moving PPSD in the right direction.”



Discord lingers on over canceled charter school lease
The education department’s presentation Tuesday added that the Providence City Council’s decision in July to reject leasing part of the Carl G. Lauro school building to Excel Academy, a charter school, has added another roadblock to the return to local control.   
The RIDE slide deck’s “Next Steps” section says the City Council needs to reckon with its decision, which the education department says increased spending by roughly $400,000 in operating costs, mainly utility costs. The Lauro School is still being used as a temporary “swing space” for Asa Messer Elementary School students while their new school building is being built. In RIDE’s estimate, the City Council effectively erased the $2.5 million investment that would have come from Excel’s cohabitation of the space.

“Our issue is PPSD needs the money, so the money needs to come from somewhere,” RIDE Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green told the K-12 council Tuesday. She acknowledged tariffs and volatile construction costs could further complicate Providence Public School Department (PPSD) spending as it works to upgrade school buildings.
The RIDE presentation says the district and city must now “determine and communicate” how they’ll fill those budget gaps.  
In a Sept. 9 letter shared with Rhode Island Current, Providence City Council President Rachel Miller expressed astonishment at PPSD’s apparently shifting stance on the lease. Miller’s letter was addressed to PPSD Superintendent Montañez, and replied to Montañez’s Sept. 3 letter to the City Council.
Montañez had suggested in his letter that, despite repeated warnings from the school department, the council’s decision to cancel the lease “now requires both PPSD and the City to reassess our budgetary priorities and make difficult adjustments to our school construction plans.”
Miller replied: “If RIDE or PPSD made budgetary decisions based on the outcome of a vote not yet taken, that was improper.” 
Miller added that in 2024, when the Lauro building was first up for potential lease to Excel, PPSD asked the City Council to deny the lease, as evidenced by a June 2024 letter from PPSD Superintendent Javier Montañez.  
“In denying the lease to Excel Academy, the City Council unambiguously complied with that formal request to temporarily return the Lauro facility to the district,” Miller wrote. “To now receive a letter condemning the very action you previously requested is, at best, puzzling.”

(Leah Romero for Source NM)Several southern New Mexico state lawmakers this week voiced concerns about the environmental impacts the proposed AI data center Project Jupiter will have on southern Doña Ana County communities, and what they described as a lack of transparency about the project.
Members of the Water and Natural Resources Committee met in Artesia this week where they received an update on the $165 billion development, which is the subject of two recently filed lawsuits, as well as criticism from county residents, also over environmental impacts and transparency. The Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners voted in September to approve $165 billion in industrial revenue bonds to support the development, during a meeting that attracted attendance of several hundred county residents.
Project Jupiter pits demand for data against New Mexico’s finite natural resources

 
“This issue is really important to me, and we can talk about the water piece, the energy piece, but I think what’s been really overwhelming to me is just the lack of community involvement in this process,” state Rep. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces) said during the meeting. “This is the pattern that I have continuously seen in my decade serving in this Legislature, is that we’re constantly looking at these shiny things, shiny industries coming into this state, while we leave our communities left out of this conversation.”
Rubio emphasized that many people in the state and across the U.S. are “cynical” about government, and bringing in a large development and authorizing millions of dollars in tax credits while residents in the area deal with arsenic-laced drinking water is “insane.”
Rubio’s comments referenced the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority, which the state environment department recently sued in part due to recent and repeated failed arsenic tests.
“I just wish that our communities had this kind of sense of urgency when it came to their matters, the way that we put forth corporations like this one,” Rubio said. “I think it’s a travesty.”
Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla) said she and other lawmakers were “misled” by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s administration and fellow lawmakers during the legislative session earlier this year, specifically concerning House Bill 93. 
The bill, which Lujan Grisham signed into law on April 8, involves advanced grid technology projects and the Public Regulation Commission. However, an amendment introduced by Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) is now being criticized as creating a “loophole” within the established Energy Transition Act, and negates certain requirements for microgrid operations. 
Padilla previously disputed that characterization to Source NM.
“We did not vet those proposals in the House. They came through a Senate floor amendment less than 48 hours to go in the legislative session,” Lara Cadena said. 
Sen. Candy Spence Ezzell (R-Roswell) said companies are eyeing Chavez and Eddy counties for a similar data center development and she is opposed to it and the negative impacts she said it will have on farmers in the region.
“What these companies are doing is they’re overinflating the cost of this land [in southeastern New Mexico],” Ezzell said during the meeting. “Whenever I see a big company coming in, ‘We’re going to build this,’ and ‘I’m going to offer you $5,000 an acre for pasture land,’ what is that doing to this young rancher, or young farmer? Like I said earlier, there’s going to be some hungry people out there. And we’ve caused it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jupiter2-1024x683.png,,,2025-10-30 18:01:35.980694

Docking State Office Building in Topeka. (Submitted)TOPEKA — State and local leaders gathered Thursday at the new Robert B. Docking State Office Building to celebrate completion of the three-year, $120 million project.
It took more than a decade for the state to determine what to do with the Docking building, as historical preservationists fought to keep the original 14-story facility, built in 1954. In the end, the state Legislature approved demolition and construction of a new three-story building.
“The opening of the new Docking State Office Building represents what we can accomplish when we work together to reimagine something from the past to meet the needs of today and the future,” said Gov. Laura Kelly in a news release. 
The new building reuses significant materials from the original Docking building, according to a state website that tracks construction progress. More than 50,000 square feet of limestone was reclaimed and reused, as were granite, greenstone and multiple historical features. 
“One of the goals for the new Docking Building was to create one of the most efficient, modern, and beautiful buildings in the country, and for this facility to be a ‘front door’ to the state government for visitors to the capitol,” said Kansas Department of Administration Secretary Adam Proffitt in the  release. 
Last week, Kansas Department of Administration Deputy Secretary Frank Burnam received the Innovation in State Government Award from the National Association of State Chief Administrators for his work on the project, the news release said.
“With 98% of the materials of the old building incorporated into the body of the new building, Kansas has integrated continuity and environmental efficiency into the Docking State Office Building,” said Brian Docking, grandson of Gov. Robert Docking. “Today I represent my great grandparents, my grandparents, and my father and uncle and the future of our family to say we are humbled by this honor.”

This story by Virginia Ray was first published in The Commons on Oct. 28, 2025.
BRATTLEBORO — She started her own restaurant at the age of 20. Today, Linda Alvarez teaches young people how to become entrepreneurs and community leaders themselves. Now, she has been named 2026 Vermont Teacher of the Year, the first career and technical education educator in the state to receive this award from the Agency of Education.
“Being recognized as Vermont’s Teacher of the Year is such an honor,” said the business and entrepreneurship teacher at the Windham Regional Career Center. “It means so much to see career and technical education celebrated on a statewide level.”
This year, Alvarez said she will “travel around Vermont visiting schools, speaking about CTE and sharing the incredible work my students do at the Windham Regional Career Center.” Alvarez, who has been at WRCC for four years, is now also part of the National Teacher of the Year Program.
“I hope to inspire more students to see career education as a path to both purpose and success,” she said. “Our young people are full of ideas and energy. They just need chances to show what they can do. When we give them those opportunities, they surprise us every time.”
Beyond book learning
In Alvarez’s classroom, students experience not just the book learning of business, but the reality.
Through projects such as the year-long Food Truck Business Plan, students design, brand and launch ventures, build 3D models of trucks, create marketing campaigns and present business plans to community leaders and local bankers.
Alvarez’s classroom is intentionally inclusive.
First-generation college students, multilingual learners and neurodiverse students thrive under her guidance. Students leave her programs empowered; many go on to earn college scholarships or enter directly into high-demand careers.
“In every way, Linda is the kind of teacher our students deserve,” said Windham Regional Career Center Director Nancy Wiese. “She is a visionary who equips them not only with skills but also with confidence and purpose to shape the future.”
“Linda is an exceptional teacher who routinely inspires her students and colleagues at the WRCC,” said Windham Southeast Supervisory Union Superintendent Mark Speno. “Vermont Teacher of the Year is an acknowledgment that is well deserved.”
Alvarez said what she likes best about her work is “watching students grow into leaders.”
“When they realize they can run a business, present to community members, or earn college credits while still in high school, their whole mindset changes,” she said. “Seeing that pride and excitement never gets old.”
The most challenging part of her job, she said, is balancing the different needs of her diverse students. “Some are new Americans learning a new language, others are the first in their family to think about college, and many are figuring out who they want to be,” said Alvarez. “Finding ways to reach every student where they are takes patience, creativity and heart.”
Asked what she’s most proud of, Alvarez said, “the opportunities my students have created for themselves.”
“Many have gone on to start small businesses, study business or marketing in college, or use their skills to help their communities,” she says. “Their success is what makes this work so meaningful to me.”
Alvarez said she decided to become a business and career teacher because she “loves helping students see the real-world side of learning.”
“I want them to understand that education can be hands-on, creative, and connected to their own dreams. I’ve always believed that when students can picture themselves in a career, they become more confident and motivated to reach their goals.”
Roots and wings
Originally from Dearborn, Michigan, and Gainesville, Florida, Alvarez now lives in Brattleboro with her husband, Orlando, and their son, Sebastian. She is also stepmother to Genie, Jamie and Joseph, and grandmother to Lucas. Outside school, she has owned and operated two successful restaurants, including the Restless Rooster, which operated on Elliot Street. She also loves cooking, camping and watching Detroit sports.
The Teacher of the Year holds an MBA from Fitchburg State University in management, marketing and communications, a B.A. in history with a minor in education from the University of Florida, and is currently completing a Certificate in School Management and Leadership from Harvard Graduate School of Education at Harvard University.
When applying to Fitchburg, Alvarez had to write a speech in which she — presciently, perhaps — was to presume she had won the very award that she has, indeed, won. She titled it: “CTE Teaching Toward Belonging, Purpose, and a Future They Choose.”
In her speech, Alvarez noted that her students come from diverse towns, cultures, learning styles and life experiences. “But here’s what they all have in common: they chose to be in my classroom,” she said. “They chose CTE. And because of that choice, they show up with passion. With curiosity. With grit. And because they chose, they thrive.
“This is one of the most important things CTE can teach us: When students feel they have agency, when they see relevance and know their work matters, they rise. So the question becomes: How do we build a system that doesn’t wait until 11th grade to engage students, but instead calls to them early, welcomes them, and shows them the way forward?”
Her answer is to do what’s being done at WRCC: “work to build that system, one intentional step at a time.” Alvarez goes on to say that “learning shouldn’t end with a grade.”
“That’s why in southern Vermont we partner with the Brattleboro Development Credit Corporation to connect students with job shadows, internships, and career pathways,” she said.  “And yet I keep returning to this: We must start sooner. CTE is not a last resort. It is not a back-up plan. It is not a side door. It is a pathway that empowers students to lead with their strengths, engage with real-world learning, and build futures rooted in relevance and purpose.”
A year of speaking and accolades
As the 2026 Vermont Teacher of the Year, Alvarez will serve as an advocate for students, educators and the transformative power of Career and Technical Education.
She will also be recognized at the University of Vermont’s Outstanding Teacher Day in November, and she will represent Vermont in the spring for the National Teacher of the Year program, which includes events in Washington, D.C.
“I am thrilled to recognize Linda as Vermont’s Teacher of the Year,” says Secretary of Education Zoie Saunders. “Linda’s commitment to equity, innovation, and excellence prepares students not only for careers and college, but for meaningful lives beyond the classroom. We are honored to recognize her contributions to teaching in Vermont.”
The Agency of Education has recognized outstanding Vermont teachers through the Vermont Teacher of the Year award since 1964. Generally, about 25 applications in the state are considered every year.

The new degree proposal would allow colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees with a minimum of 90 semester hours, which is 30 hours fewer than a typical four-year degree. Schools would need the board’s approval before offering a reduced credit degree..
During a board meeting Thursday, Deputy Commissioner Lisa Johnson, chief academic and student affairs officer for the North Dakota University System, said, as the proposal is currently written, it could apply to any bachelor’s degree program offered at state colleges and universities.
She added the Higher Learning Commission, which accredits colleges and universities across the U.S., said schools implementing reduced credit bachelor’s degrees need to be mindful of potential transfers, graduate programs and license requirements associated with the new degrees that could jeopardize state-to-state licensure compacts.

Johnson said only one public school, Yavapai College in Prescott, Arizona, was offering the reduced bachelor’s degrees and rest of the reduced credit offerings were at for-profit schools.
Levi Bachmeier, the new superintendent of the Department of Public Instruction in-waiting, embraced the idea and said state colleges and universities could do more to innovate new pathways for students.
“This would not require institutions to offer these reduced credit bachelor’s degrees,” Bachmeier said. “We are just allowing them to put an additional arrow in the quiver that I view it as an opportunity to retain and recruit more North Dakotans to get a quality education.”

Bachmeier was also supportive of a “warning label” being attached to potential degrees.
A draft label was included in the board’s meeting documents that read: “Students enrolling in a reduced credit bachelor’s degree program must be advised of the potential financial aid, academic, and career implications of obtaining a reduced credit bachelor’s degree.”
The North Dakota Student Association unanimously opposed the reduced bachelor’s degree proposal during a recent meeting, said Maxwell Eriksrud, a University of North Dakota student and student representative on the State Board of Higher Education.

“By reducing these requirements, I think you’re going to be reducing the actual benefit of college for these students,” Eriksrud said. “I think there is also a slight disconnect between admin and student concerns in this policy.”
Of the reduced credit bachelor’s degrees approved by the Higher Learning Commission, Johnson said the titles of the degrees are no different than a regular bachelor’s degree, but many of the reduced degrees appeared to be bachelor’s of applied science.
“As a board, you could designate that. You could require us to have something like that in the title,” Johnson said.
Valley City State University, Mayville State University and Bismarck State College all have programs outlined that would allow graduation with fewer than the traditional 120 credit hours. 
Valley City State’s program to reduce the credit requirement to 106 credits – one less semester – for an education degree had already been approved by a committee, pending the board’s approval of the policy change. 
Larry Brooks, vice president for academic affairs Valley City State, told a committee on Sept. 4 that the last semester would often be used for obtaining an extra endorsement, such as kindergarten or special education. 
He said students could always come back to school to get that endorsement. He said having some professional experience would help students be more confident that seeking such an endorsement fits with their career goals. 
Kevin Black, chair of the State Board of Higher Education, said the board is duty-bound to protect the best interests of students and, while his entrepreneurial spirit wants to try the reduced credit degree program at schools in the state, he thinks more guardrails are required before the policy can move forward.
“I would not want to send my son or daughter to an institution for a reduced degree and then totally blow their chances to get a job,” Black said. 
The board voted to send the proposal to the Academic and Student Affairs Committee to provide more regulations surrounding the reduced credit degrees before the board takes up a revised policy in December.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The state of North Carolina and a coalition of businesses and groups are donating almost $18 million to the state’s food banks, Gov. Josh Stein’s office said Thursday, as they prepare for a surge of need due to a pause in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.
The state will grant $10 million to food banks. Insurance provider AmeriHealth Caritas is donating $5 million, and the David & Nicole Tepper Foundation is fast-tracking $2.5 million as part of a previous longer-term $10 million donation.
Other businesses, including Duke Energy and Bank of America, are also contributing.
“Shoring up our state’s food banks will serve as a critical, but fleeting, lifeline for families in need, and I hope other North Carolina organizations will also step up in this time of need,” Stein said in a statement. “Whether it’s paying our military, ensuring no child goes hungry, or lowering health care costs, leaders in Washington need to come together immediately to find a bipartisan solution that provides long-term stability for millions of Americans.”
Stein’s office did not immediately respond to an inquiry about the source of the $10 million.
Amy Beros, president and CEO of Food Bank of Central & Eastern NC, said in a statement that food banks were “working tirelessly to meet the increased need.”
But she stressed that they could not replicate the scale of SNAP, which provides nine meals for every one that food banks do. The nearly $18 million pales in comparison to SNAP’s estimated monthly total benefits in the state — $230 to $250 million.
“We need swift action to ensure this critical support continues uninterrupted for those who need it most,” Beros said. “Every day of delay means more empty plates and tougher choices for our neighbors.”
Around 1.4 million North Carolinians receive SNAP benefits. Ten of the state’s 99 counties have more than a quarter of their residents participating.
Those benefits will be put on hold Saturday as the U.S. Department of Agriculture halts payment amid the federal government shutdown. A coalition of Democratic states and officials, including Attorney General Jeff Jackson, have sued to force USDA to dip into its reserve fund to continue paying benefits.
Other federal food assistance programs are also expected to run out of funding soon, including WIC, which helps women, infants and children.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/La-semilla-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-10-30 17:16:40.605569

As the nation grapples with a growing mental health crisis, a residential therapeutic community in Vermont’s Green Mountains is asking its residents to slow down and do the work.

Anyone who struggles with mental health and substance abuse—or loves someone who does—knows the path to healing is often long, filled with ups and downs. Yet, the solution-focused, brief interventions favored by insurance companies can imply that successful recovery is time-limited.
Amid a national mental health crisis, one residential therapeutic community in the Green Mountains of Vermont is asking its residents to slow down and do the work. 
Spring Lake Ranch has operated since 1932, and in that time, the core program has remained much the same. Adults experiencing mental health and substance-use challenges live and work alongside staff to run a functioning farm. 
The Ranch’s model is a Therapeutic Work Program, which combines several evidence-based practices with psychiatric care to prepare residents for life after treatment. The model requires time to reap the full benefits, with a recommended stay of at least six months. Some residents stay for multiple years.  
Work therapy is at the program’s heart. Broadly popularized in the eighteenth century, its philosophical roots can be found as far back as Plato’s techne and the Buddhist practice of Zen cultivation. It is a powerful intervention for residents who feel stuck in a cycle of hopelessness or failure. By engaging in meaningful work, they find purpose and connect to something larger than themselves. When they do something they never thought they could—helping to birth a calf, for instance, or chopping down a 50-foot-tall tree—their self-worth and self-efficacy surge. This cultivates hope, which is the key to long-term recovery.
The other theory at the core of the Ranch’s approach is milieu therapy, a flexible and holistic method of care. Milieu therapy is essentially living an engaged life within a supportive, structured community. It incorporates daily living activities with relationship-building and routines that provide consistency and clear expectations. Within the milieu, residents and caregivers work together to explore and model healthy functioning. Early research centered on patients living with schizophrenia, demonstrated marked reductions in violent and inappropriate behaviors. Loneliness is a major risk factor in mental health, so this type of community can also benefit people struggling with mood disorders, addiction, depression, anxiety, or failure to launch.  
Work and the milieu are foundational for the Ranch’s approach, but the therapeutic philosophies don’t stop there. Situated in an undeveloped mountain-top forest, with a pristine, spring-fed lake and Vermont’s distinct seasonality, the Ranch is a great place to experience the positive effects of nature therapy. Some of the researched benefits of nature therapy include decreased cortisol levels (the stress hormone) and increased absorption of Vitamin D, both of which reduce risk factors for physical health problems. Regular time in nature is also shown to improve creativity and problem-solving skills, mindfulness, and overall mood. Outdoor activities help residents exercise, build trust in their abilities, and nurture social relationships through shared experience. With similar benefits as nature therapy, animal-assisted therapy is also part of daily life at the Ranch. Caring for livestock is an important function of the farm, with frequent opportunities for residents to engage with other animals as well, including dogs, cats, donkeys, and horses.

Residents also receive one-on-one clinical therapy, group therapy, nutritional counseling, recovery programming, psychiatric care, and medication management. The model is not about replacing one standard of care with another but rather marrying traditional and alternative methods into a single approach. It allows residents to take their time not only to reach a baseline level of functioning, but to encounter and resolve new challenges and push through the plateau that often leads to relapse. 
The Ranch currently has two step-down programs that provide residents even more time to prepare themselves for life after treatment. An ongoing Capital Campaign seeks to expand this programming by building a mini-neighborhood on the property, with specialized assistance for residents who are ready for more independence. The new transitional program will allow residents to stay at the Ranch for longer periods of time at a lower-price point. They will learn independent living skills and receive assistance with finding employment.
For nearly a century, Spring Lake Ranch has observed success stories. These successes, defined by each resident’s individual needs and goals, have been difficult to quantify. A few years ago, the Ranch began measuring outcomes using the Daily Living Activities (DLA-20) assessment. Collecting results from 2019 – 2021, they learned just how impactful the Therapeutic Work Program can be. The DLA-20 identifies levels of functioning across twenty domains, including personal relationships, drug and alcohol use, grooming, and time and money management. On the 7-point scale, 1 represents extremely severe impairment, and 7 represents no impairment. 
Taken together, the Ranch’s respondents showed clinically significant improvements in global functioning across all twenty domains, with an average improvement of 1.21 points. Individually, 76% of residents improved in a domain by as much as 4.3 points. The benchmark for clinically significant results is that 35% of respondents improve by at least half a point, so the Ranch far exceeded the benchmark for success.
The Ranch hopes this data will be the first step toward increasing support from insurance companies and health agencies for models like their Therapeutic Work Program. They also hope the new transitional program, funded by their Capital Campaign, will serve as a blueprint for treatment centers across the country.

Mental health is a lifelong journey; individuals who experience mental illness and addiction will continue to manage symptoms long after treatment. Spring Lake Ranch has found that residents will have stronger success when they’re provided individualized, holistic care at their own pace. This provides long-term benefit not just for individual residents but for the communities they return to as well. Investment in different approaches to mental health care is an investment in a functioning society.

,Source New Mexico,2025-10-30 21:07:31+00:00,Source New Mexico,Planned Interior layoffs could cripple limited New Mexico wildfire research,"Bryce Dix, KUNM News",,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/10/30/planned-interior-layoffs-could-cripple-limited-new-mexico-wildfire-research/,Planned layoffs at the United States Department of Interior could cripple limited New Mexico wildfire research,"An undated photo of snow falling at Redondito Peak at the Valles Caldera National Preserve. (Courtesy U.S. National Park Service)Earlier this month, the Department of the Interior submitted court documents outlining its plans to lay off just over 2,000 employees nation-wide amid the ongoing government shutdown.
While these firings have been put on hold, for now, they could strip New Mexico of already scarce wildfire research resources.
According to the court filings, the proposed layoffs will impact many different sectors under the Interior – including a sizable 57% reduction of staff at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Fort Collins Science Center, which does scientific research for a slew of natural resource agencies.
That would leave the center with just 30 people overall.
While most of its staff are based in Colorado, the center has a small but mighty research presence in New Mexico.
“The New Mexico Landscapes Field Station was this institution of incredible forest ecology research in New Mexico, doing some of the most groundbreaking, fascinating forest research,” Andreas Wion told KUNM.
Up until two months ago, Wion was a research ecologist at the station but felt “forced out” as the Trump administration actively and aggressively downsizes the federal government.
Reflecting on his tenure at the field station, Wion pointed to the research he did on tree growth rings as an important contribution to documenting fire on the landscape.
“Oftentimes that involves collecting either small cores or sections of trees, cross dating the rings, making sure they all line up in the right way, and then looking for evidence of past fires within the tree rings,” Wion said.
By collecting over 2500 different unique fire scar sites from tree rings across the country, the New Mexico field station spearheaded a North American “fire scar atlas,” giving historical fire insights over the entire continent.
Currently, in addition to analyzing tree rings, the New Mexico field station has three employees listed on its website who research fire, forest ecology and wildlife. Some of this research has spanned decades in the Jemez Mountains and the Valles Caldera.
But, Wion said there are very few forest ecologists who study the impacts of wildfire in New Mexico, highlighting the dangers that the proposed job cuts can have for understanding wildfire in the Southwest.
“You can have missing years in your data, but losing the infrastructure, the people, the knowledge, the intellectual capacity to continue these long term data sets is something that can’t just be rehired and re-taught,” Wion said.
While the center is indeed small – and always has been – it attracts lots of grants and research money, said Craig D. Allen, a retired research ecologist and former leader of the New Mexico USGS field station. Allen founded the center over three decades ago, first headquartered at Bandelier National Monument.
“I mean, it’s productive,” Allen said. “For every dollar USGS puts into it [the New Mexico Landscape Field Office] has, over the last 20 years, brought in $3 of non-base funding to support the work that’s been done.”
Allen said that the USGS field station was revolutionary for its time, but was eventually followed by newer institutions dedicated to research forest ecosystems, such as the New Mexico Highland’s New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute and the University of New Mexico’s Earth Systems Ecology Lab.
Still, he is insistent the USGS field station stands out from the rest, thanks to the broad swath of fire ecological work it does.
“The field station in its current, modest form, still has the potential to continue to be productive if it manages to persist through current governmental reorganization,” Allen added.
For now, a federal judge has temporarily halted the ongoing and pending shutdown firings as a lawsuit from two federal employee unions snakes through the courts – creating confusion within the Department of the Interior on what positions are possibly subject to layoffs.
If these planned job reductions come to fruition, it’s unclear if the New Mexico field station will be left intact.
Messages to the Department of the Interior and Fort Collins Science Center seeking comment and interviews were met with automatic messages about the ongoing government shutdown, which prohibits most federal employees from working until Congress passes an appropriations bill.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7357efbf-f0f2-464b-b546-38956ff04659HiResProxy-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-30 17:16:40.605569

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Private fundraising will help South Dakota Public Broadcasting save just under half of the employees originally selected for layoffs earlier this year, the organization said Thursday. 
SDPB announced potential cuts in August after Congress and President Donald Trump canceled $1.1 billion in previously approved nationwide funding for public media. That decision cost SDPB $2.2 million, or about 20% of its budget. At the time, state funds accounted for a little more than half of SDPB’s budget, while grants, private donations and other sources made up the rest.
The softened layoffs, down to seven from the 15 announced earlier, were made possible by a mixture of restructuring, donations and grants. 
“This is a remarkable demonstration of what South Dakota can do when we pull together,” Executive Director Julie Overgaard said in a news release.
Four journalists, two engineers and one marketing specialist were laid off, Overgaard confirmed with South Dakota Searchlight. Additionally, five open positions will remain unfilled. The open positions and layoffs will reduce the organization’s staff from 63.5 full-time equivalent positions to 51.5.

“South Dakota Focus,” an in-depth public affairs television program, will be eliminated and magazine-style TV program “Dakota Life” will reduce its output. Public affairs radio program “In The Moment” will be incorporated into breaks during the national “Morning Edition” show, with host Lori Walsh producing the segments. “In The Moment,” which is currently an hour-long standalone show, will be shortened to about 15 total minutes on air, with extra content shared in the program’s podcast.
Friends of SDPB, the organization’s nonprofit fundraising arm, did not share how much money was raised in its months-long donation drive. The organization’s Bison Campaign, launched after the funding rescission, has a $2 million goal. A message on the Friends of SDPB website as of Thursday said “we’re already more than halfway there.”
Overgaard said SDPB received “very generous” foundation grants to continue providing education resources for the next year. SDPB will have to determine a “strategic redirection” for its educational programming before the grant expires.
SDPB will retain live legislative audio and video feeds, high school fine arts and sports event broadcasts, and emergency communications.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Some Oklahoma leaders are asking the governor to call a special session to provide emergency state funding for food assistance programs during the federal government shutdown. 
Over 680,000 Oklahomans could be cut off from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, on Saturday if the shutdown continues. Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday called on Oklahomans, nonprofits, food banks and religious groups to step up to help fill the gap, but he said the state will not use its savings to replace the program’s funding yet. 
Tribal leaders, members of the legislative Black caucus and House and Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are calling for Republicans to take greater action, including holding a special session to tap into the state’s savings to fund the program and feed Oklahomans.

A special session can be called by the governor or by the Legislature, if two-thirds of both the House and Senate sign on. 
“We have an obligation to protect children,” said Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, in a statement. “The solutions offered by the governor (Wednesday) are inadequate. He needs to call the Legislature into a special session to work on real and immediate solutions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, did not comment Thursday on the calls for a special session to tap into the state’s savings.  
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because Congress has failed to find a bipartisan path forward on a stopgap spending bill by the start of the federal fiscal year. A Republican proposal seeks to temporarily keep the government open through Nov. 21. Democrats back a separate plan to permanently restore health subsidies for those who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, said in a statement Thursday that lawmakers know Oklahomans are being impacted “through no fault of their own,” but Congress needs to “do their job and vote to reopen the federal government.” 
“We cannot sustain funding SNAP benefits – which cost over $100 million a month in Oklahoma – for long with only state dollars, leaving Oklahomans in no better position than they are facing with the Nov. 1 deadline,” Lawson said. “Not to mention funding for our troops, air traffic controllers and other safety programs. Many of our own state employees are facing furloughs. Their salaries depend on federal dollars.”
Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskins Jr. called on Stitt to use the state’s surplus funding in the rainy day fund to replace the SNAP benefits that could be cut off come Nov 1.

The “rainy day fund,” otherwise known as the constitutional reserve fund, was created to collect surplus revenue to spend in select circumstances. The fund is capped at 15% of the current estimate for the state’s general revenue fund, according to the Oklahoma Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan Tulsa-based think tank.
The fund’s current balance sits at more than $1.32 billion, according to the House budget portal. 
Hoskins said now is the time to use the fund to help Oklahomans to “stem misery that (Stitt) did not cause.” 
“This crisis, a product of failures in Washington, D.C., can be fixed at least in the short term, if we all pitch in,” Hoskins said in a statement. “The state of Oklahoma should join us by immediately committing $142 million to save SNAP for Oklahomans through the end of November.”
The Cherokee Nation has committed some of its surplus funding to help provide relief to “thousands of Cherokees in Oklahoma” who could lose SNAP benefits, Hoskins said in a statement. The tribal nation is also providing $1.25 million to food banks and nonprofits to “help all of our friends and neighbors,” according to a statement. 
State law, though, limits how much of the rainy day funds can be spent. 
No more than three-eighths of the fund can be used in the case of a revenue shortfall in the current budget year or to use in the next budget year when there’s a predicted shortfall, according to the Oklahoma Policy Institute. Three-eighths of the current fund equates to around $495 million.

A quarter of the fund, which would be about $330 million, can be spent using the appropriations process in the case of an emergency and $10 million can be spent on “tax incentives for at-risk manufacturers.” 
An emergency must be declared by the governor with two-thirds of the House and Senate agreeing to appropriate the funding, or by a “joint declaration of emergency conditions” by the House Speaker and President Pro Tem of the Senate with approval from three-quarters of each legislative chamber. 
Five members of the Oklahoma Legislative Black Caucus, all Democrats, on Wednesday signed a letter to Stitt, Paxton and Hilbert asking for a special session to address SNAP benefits and the “devastating impact” a lapse in benefits could have. The members said ensuring food access is nonpartisan and a “moral responsibility” and urged swift action, according to a news release. 
“The welfare of Oklahoma’s citizens must remain the top priority of elected leaders at every level of government,” according to the letter. “If Governor Stitt fails to act, we call on legislative leadership to gather the signatures necessary to convene a special session to provide temporary state funding for SNAP recipients until the federal shutdown is resolved.”

“Washington has failed to do its job,” Gov. Spencer Cox said in a statement. “Utah is stepping up so families, especially those in rural communities, can keep food on the table. Because Utah Food Bank serves Utahns in all 29 counties, additional state resources will reach small towns and city neighborhoods alike, including our federal employee neighbors who’ve gone too long without a paycheck.” 
‘Hopeless’: Utahns say shutdown’s pause on food stamp funding carries a steep cost

Last week, Adams said the state isn’t equipped to fund federal programs for weeks or months, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which is not being funded in November in the midst of the shutdown. 
Republican legislative leaders urged Congress to end the shutdown, many faulting Democrats for it. 
“The responsibility to end this shutdown lies with our federal partners in Washington. Congress must stop the political games and reopen the government. Every day this shutdown drags on, hardworking Americans are hurt. It’s time for Congress to do its job and put the American people first,” Adams said in a statement Thursday. 
Congressional Democrats argue that the shutdown came after Republicans refused to negotiate over extending subsidies for health insurance policies offered under the Affordable Care Act. Those subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year.
The Utah leaders urged faith-based organizations, nonprofits and the community to join the initiative and support local food banks and pantries.
“We’re providing targeted, temporary, and accountable support to ensure every dollar makes a real difference and that the most vulnerable Utahns get the help they need,” Schultz said in the release. “We’re calling on all Utahns — nonprofits, faith groups, businesses, and families — to step up, lend a hand, and make a difference. It’s in moments like this that we see what truly makes Utah special.”

(Courtesy photo by Roxana Martinez-Gracias)A group of unionized janitors held up a banner reading “Keep T.F. Green safe & clean” and handed out leaflets to passengers traveling in and out Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport Thursday morning.
Seven janitors organized under SEIU 32BJ urged passengers to email airport CEO Iftikhar Ahmad and pressure officials to stop a new cleaning service vendor from cutting workers’ hours. 
The Rhode Island Airport Corporation’s (RIAC) board of directors in August awarded SJ Services of Danvers, Massachusetts, a three-year contract to manage cleaning services at the Warwick airport. SJ Servivces was among five bidders for the contract, which begins Friday.
Airport board votes to pursue new janitorial services vendor over union worker objections

“It definitely got some attention from folks,” Roxana Martinez-Gracias, a communications specialist for the union, said in an interview. “It was a nice introduction to talk about the problem at hand.”
The union fears that its 27-member cleaning crew will likely be cut in half under the new contract.
That staffing cut was based on a cost proposal sheet included with bid procurement documents that had janitors working a collective 2,700 hours per month over a potential five-year contract term. Under prior contracts, janitors worked between 4,300 and 5,000 hours per month, according to union officials.
 “It’s a bit up in the air how things are going to progress,” Martinez-Gracias said. “We’re still in communication with T.F. Green about trying to hear the workers’ testimony to sit down with us, but that just hasn’t happened yet.”
Airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said the airport corporation has no role in determining the number of janitorial workers.
“RIAC is not in a position, nor is it legally permitted, to create additional positions at a cost of $93,000 per position for janitorial roles that fall outside the scope of a competitively awarded contract, simply to satisfy a union demand based on a previously underperforming vendor,” Fischer said in an email to Rhode Island Current. 
Fischer said the max cap of 2,700 hours determined by airport officials for the bidding process “were necessary to maintain a clean and safe terminal.”
Janitorial services at the airport were handled for the past 15 years by Denmark-based ISS Facilities. Fischer said the company chose not to seek to renew its contract. Fischer said the airport had “received multiple complaints” about cleanliness under ISS.
Fischer shared with Rhode Island Current copies of violation notices sent to ISS in July 2024 and July 2025, noting “persistent grime” in the terminal, along with “inadequate restroom maintenance.”
“It is clear that ISS management is failing to properly manage staff to meet the required performance levels,” the July 31, 2025, notice states.
Despite the concerns of airport officials, the cleanliness of T.F. Green helped the Warwick airport reach the distinction of being the best in the world, according to Travel + Leisure magazine.
“RIAC has a legally binding contract with a vendor — backed by a performance bond — that guarantees our high standards for janitorial services,” Fisher said. “In contrast, a union is demanding an arbitrary increase in staffing, using a poorly performing previous vendor as the yardstick.”
A representative from SJ Services did not immediately respond to request for comment.

In an Oct. 20 letter posted to the attorney general’s website, Uthmeier told Sarasota’s Republican State Attorney, Ed Brodsky, that he and his staff should be allowed to bring their guns into courtrooms — even though the Chief Judge of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit decreed otherwise in a September order.
“The Chief Judge’s Administrative Order clearly conflicts with and attempts to amend Florida law,” Uthmeier wrote in his advisory opinion, insisting that the circuit has “contravened” the law. These opinions are not binding, and while courts have to consider them in litigation, they don’t need to abide by them.
“The Order cannot lawfully prohibit the State Attorney, assistant state attorneys, and their investigators from carrying firearms in the Twelfth Circuit’s courtrooms.”
He argued that although Florida statute empowers judges to limit “any person” from bringing weapons into their courtrooms, state attorneys and their staff don’t count as “any person.”
They count as law enforcement.
“Law enforcement officers—including state attorneys, assistant state attorneys, and investigators—do not fall within the definition of ‘any person,'” he said.

Uthmeier’s opinion tracks with his dogged pro-gun rights approach since Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him to the chief legal position in February. He declined to defend a decades-old ban on open carry last month when the First District Court of Appeal struck it down as unconstitutional. He has since asked the legislature to clean up state statute to reflect the decision.
Similarly, he’s preemptively refused to defend a Parkland-era law that lowered the gun-buying age if it makes it to the Florida Supreme Court — unlike his predecessors. This  approach comes as House Republicans are set to consider (for the fourth year in a row) whether to return the gun-purchasing age to 21. DeSantis, meanwhile, has advocated for a repeal of Florida’s red flag laws, but the state Senate has largely avoided touching gun laws since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018.
Why did Uthmeier write this opinion?
The dispute arose after Judge Diana Moreland in September finalized new restrictions on where state attorneys can carry firearms: state attorneys and their staff could carry firearms into court facilities where their offices are, but not in courthouses without their offices or in any courtroom. Moreland oversees cases in Sarasota, Manatee, and DeSoto counties.
Brodsky disagreed, and wrote to Uthmeier to ask his legal opinion. Because this isn’t a court case, the attorney general as Florida’s chief legal officer can offer advisory opinions that often carry great weight in future litigation and serve as a guideline for state attorneys.
Uthmeier referenced a 1988 opinion by Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth in a letter to then-State Attorney Janet Reno, a Democrat serving Miami-Dade who went on to serve as U.S. Attorney General. Butterworth believed that assistant state attorneys are law enforcement, and therefore could carry weapons into court in their official capacity.
“The Florida legislature has recognized the importance of the safety of prosecutors by giving them the right to arm themselves in the course of their official duties,” Uthmeier wrote.
“While [statute] contemplates a Chief Judge’s ability to regulate the carrying of firearms in courthouses and courtrooms, the State Attorney, assistant state attorneys, and investigators plainly fall outside that statute’s permissible regulatory sweep.”

Maine Gov. Janet Mills knows the $1.2 million she has allocated to help plug the hole that will be left by lapsed federal food assistance will not be enough but said the state has limited options without federal support.
With 170,000 Mainers set to lose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits due to the ongoing government shutdown, anti-hunger advocates are pushing for the Maine Legislature to step in and provide additional funding to make up for the roughly $29 million that goes to low-income households each month.
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

Mills announced Wednesday she would be allocating $1.2 million to Good Shepherd Food Bank and Maine’s network of Area Agencies on Aging. One day later, appearing at Good Shepherd’s Auburn location, the governor said that the money will last “as long as we can spread it out.”
But, she said, the ultimate responsibility lies with the federal government, particularly the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which Mills said is falsely saying that a contingency fund can’t be used to bolster SNAP during the shutdown, reversing its previous plan to do so.
“They can stop this,” she said. “They can authorize the expenditure of the $5 billion contingency fund, and they can stop the shutdown.”
Of the state’s current allocation, Anna Korsen, deputy director of anti-hunger advocacy group Full Plates, Full Potential, told Maine Morning Star, “the gap is enormous — and this investment will not close it.”
“Maine is in a hunger crisis, and no food pantry can replace SNAP. For every one meal provided by a pantry, SNAP provides nine,” she added. Korsen also pointed out that access to those pantries, “which are often open only for limited hours during the week, can also be difficult for working caregivers and parents trying to feed their kids.”
Food pantries are already stretched thin. Preble Street in Portland is increasing its capacity to serve more than 2,400 meals a day, seven days a week to meet the need, according to Director Mark Swann.
“But, I want to stress, this is not a solution,” he said. “It is a temporary remedy to fill the tremendous gap left by this loss of SNAP benefits to vulnerable communities.”

Calls for special legislative session
If Maine does want to appropriate more funds to plug the hole left by federal SNAP funding, it would have to be approved by the Legislature. 
Several lawmakers and anti-poverty groups have publicly called on the governor and legislative leaders to convene a special session to address what many are describing as a funding crisis. A special session can be called by the governor, or by presiding officers with the consent of a majority of lawmakers.
“This is an all-hands-on-deck moment for our state government,” said Robyn Merrill, executive director of Maine Equal Justice, which along with Full Plates, Full Potential and the Maine Center for Economic Policy called on policymakers to make an urgent plan for additional funding.
Citing the right to food enshrined in the Maine Constitution in 2021, Maine Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) sent a letter to Mills and Democratic leaders asking them to use their authority to convene a special session to cover the estimated $29 million gap in SNAP payments each month.
Mills said they are looking at all options. “But the answer,” she said, “is in the hands of the administration in Washington right now,”
Asked whether they would work with their colleagues to convene a special session, GOP leaders said congressional Democrats should support the Republican stopgap spending plan and end the government shutdown.
Pointing to Mills’ bid for U.S. Senate, which has been supported by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sen. Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), said, “wouldn’t it make more sense for her to just ask him to end this nonsense and re-open the federal government by extending Biden’s budget, rather than spending state resources through a special session?”
Democratic leaders, alternately, put the onus on President Donald Trump’s administration for withholding SNAP contingency funds. 
“While we as a state need to stay creative and collaborative to weather this—we must not forget who is to blame,” said Maine Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland). “ The USDA has the funds needed for this vital program. This is a deliberate punishment and attack on states.”
Maine House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said he’d support a special session if Maine’s Republican leaders commit that their caucus will support a bill to cover food assistance for kids, families, and seniors. 
“I can tell you Democrats will absolutely support funding the Trump-imposed shortfall,” Fecteau said.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Existing challenges for Arkansas’ farmers could be exacerbated by a prolonged federal government shutdown, Congressman Steve Womack told industry leaders Thursday, though he said he’s hopeful there will be movement toward reopening the government next week.
The shutdown, which has affected air traffic controller staffing, resulted in Womack’s flight from Washington D.C. being delayed last night as the Republican congressman traveled to Northwest Arkansas to host a roundtable discussion with members of the local agriculture industry Thursday morning.
The roundtable was not open to reporters, but Womack, who represents Arkansas’ 3rd Congressional District, told members of the media afterward that a labor supply shortage and the high costs of feed, seed, fertilizer, land and equipment are driving farmers out of business.
‘A dire strait’: 1 in 3 farms could close without aid, Arkansas agriculture leaders tell lawmakers

Bill Haak, husband of former Republican state Rep. Delia Haak, raises dairy and beef cattle in Benton County. The eighth-generation dairy farmer said one of the challenges he’s facing is “pretty rough” milk prices that have thankfully been offset by beef prices. 
“The milk is lower due to the federal milk market order,” he said, referring to a federal system that maintains a stable marketing relationship between processors and producers. “It’s just like everything else, supply and demand, and right now there’s just a saturation of milk in the country and the federal milk market order reflects that.”
Farmers often rely on subsidies from the federal government and the ongoing shutdown could impact their ability to access programs, like those that offset the loss of livestock, according to the Benton County Cooperative Extension Service’s Johnny Gunsaulis. 
“Like I said in the meeting, the livestock people in this part of the world really take pride that we’re one of the areas of the state that receive a lower amount of government payments, and most people are pretty proud of that, but when they do need those for help, this government shutdown will affect those producers,” Gunsaulis said. 
The shutdown is also affecting research at the University of Arkansas’ Division of Agriculture where a number of county extension agents and research are partially federally funded, the division’s vice president Deacue Fields said. No employees have been furloughed, according to Fields, who said the division is using carryover funds to keep staff paid. 
But it’s a short-term solution that’s preventing the division from being proactive with research because it isn’t able to invest resources like it typically would, he said. Avian influenza, for example, is one research area the division is “heavily involved in” and this is the season where there’s generally an uptick in the disease, Fields said. Avian influenza was identified in a backyard flock in Mississippi County, according to an Oct. 10 update from the division. Roughly 60 birds were destroyed as a result. 
“The overall investment in agriculture research really matters for us to be able to continue to stay ahead of the curve and be able to feed a growing population with the same amount of land, same amount of production assets that we had before,” Fields said. “It takes research and innovation.”
Womack said the early stages of a federal government shutdown often don’t affect people too much, but the overall economy will be affected as the closure continues.
For example, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are expected to lapse Saturday, which Womack said would affect more than 200,000 people in Arkansas, a state with the highest food insecurity rate in the nation, according to a September 2024 USDA report. 
“To the people who would suggest that the government shutdown doesn’t necessarily affect them, let me assure them it completely affects them. It just may not show up because they’re still getting a paycheck and they’re still going about their daily routines,” Womack said.

Democrats and Republicans in Washington have been deadlocked for weeks, making no visible progress in negotiations to reopen the government. The shutdown began Oct. 1 after Congress failed to approve a funding bill before the start of the new fiscal year. 
A sticking point for Democrats has been tax credits used by people who buy their own health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace; the credits are set to expire at the end of this year. Republicans have said negotiations about the credits can begin once the government is funded.
Womack said Thursday he’s “hearing whispers” about conversations behind the scenes that could lead to action soon. With the pain inflicted by the loss of SNAP benefits, Womack said he’s hopeful there will be a plan drafted next week that would allow lawmakers to approve three pending appropriations bills, one of which is related to agriculture. SNAP benefits are administered by the Department of Agriculture.
“Then, once you get government reopened, the two sides, bicameral, bipartisan, can sit down at the table and then start discussing other emerging issues, and certainly health care is going to be one of those, what to do with enhanced tax credits that expire at the end of this year for the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “Those are the kinds of discussions that we need to be having right now, but you can’t have them if you’ve got two sides that are sitting in their corners right now unwilling to work with each other.”
In addition to agriculture, Womack said the shutdown is delaying the approval of a transportation and housing appropriation bill that includes around $100 million for projects in his district, including highway construction and water system improvements.

Families can meet Scouting leaders and learn about activities at events scheduled in November in New Castle County.
WILMINGTON, Del. — Scouting is growing across New Castle County as families look for structured, values-based programs that blend leadership, outdoor adventure, and community service.
“Scouting gives kids real chances to lead, serve, and try new things in a safe, supportive setting,” said John Walker, Scout Master of Troop 67. “Parents see their children gaining confidence and character week by week,” Walker said.
Local Scout units are adding members and inviting interested parents and youth to a series of Join Scouting nights in November.
“We’re seeing strong interest across Delaware because families want exciting programs with hands-on experiences that promote life skills—from Cub Scouts through high-adventure crews—and plenty of chances for parents to get involved,” said Ray Teat, Scouting executive for the Del-Mar-Va Council.
Scouting in Delaware offers age-appropriate options for boys and girls—including Cub Scout packs, Scouts BSA troops, Venturing crews, Sea Scout ships, and Exploring posts—giving youth multiple paths based on age and interest. (Scouts BSA typically organizes youth into single-gender troops, while Venturing, Sea Scouts, and Exploring operate coed.)
The program starts with Cub Scouts and family-friendly weekly activities that build basic skills, with monthly outings and annual trips to keep engagement high. “Our proximity to trails, waterways, and historic sites makes it a natural fit for hiking, camping, and conservation projects,” Teat said.
Outdoor programming is a cornerstone. Scouts regularly camp at nearby parks and Scout reservations. Day trips and weekend campouts introduce skills such as tent and camp-kitchen setup, trail safety, map and compass, and Leave No Trace principles. Older youth advance to backpacking treks, canoe and kayak outings on area rivers, cold-weather camping, climbing, and orienteering events. Sea Scouts focus on boating safety, seamanship, navigation and stewardship of local waterways. Many activities pair outdoor skills with service, including trail work, habitat restoration, and community cleanups.
Scouting experiences translate directly into leadership and life skills. Scouts plan trips and menus, manage budgets, and lead teams—building project-management and problem-solving abilities along the way. Merit badges expose youth to careers and practical knowledge in first aid, personal fitness, robotics, citizenship, and personal finance. The advancement framework provides clear goals, often culminating in Eagle Scout service projects that require proposal writing, fundraising, logistics, and volunteer coordination. Youth also log service hours, practice public speaking as patrol leaders, and mentor younger members.
Programs are open to all, with coed options in several tracks. Venturing emphasizes high adventure and leadership for teens; Exploring connects youth with career fields; Sea Scouts centers on maritime skills. Leaders say the inclusive lineup helps Scouting meet families where they are and adapt to community needs. Age-appropriate challenges—from backyard campfires to multi-day treks—are delivered with trained adult leadership and safety protocols to build resilience and sound judgment.

Stantec officials stressed that the concept is subject to change. (Courtesy Stantec)Members of a new board overseeing up to $500 million in investment to re-envision the State Fair grounds in Albuquerque authorized about $67 million for infrastructure—including millions aimed at two dangerous intersections. 
The State Fair District Board, which the Legislature created earlier this year, is tasked with overseeing the design and authorizing spending for the 236-acre site in the heart of Albuquerque that abuts the International District neighborhood. The state-owned site has emerged as a target for investment that board members and neighbors say they hope will benefit the neighborhood, long beset with crime, drug use and poverty. 
The board unanimously gave initial approval for spending for the project’s early phases, including about $16 million for demolition and land preparation, $27 million for internal roadways and utilities, $19 million for a 10-acre park and $6 million for”off-site” pedestrian safety improvements. 
Members also received their first glimpse at  “pre-development draft concepts” for the fairgrounds.
Officials at Stantec, the firm developing a master plan for the redevelopment, also provided the concepts to Source New Mexico, though they stressed the designs are preliminary and subject to change, including based on the public’s input at upcoming meetings.

Even with the project in its nascent stage, the impact on the International District and its residents has been the subject of much conversation among board members, including Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller and New Mexico Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque). The development may also mean the annual State Fair will need to find a new home. 
The intersections on both sides of the fairgrounds, where Central Avenue crosses San Pedro Drive and Louisiana Boulevard, are the two most dangerous intersections in New Mexico for pedestrians, according to state Transportation Department data. Forty-two crashes involving pedestrians occurred at those two intersections in 2024.
The design concepts Stantec shared aim to open up the site with green space, parks and amenities, including an arena or other large community venue, along with an unspecified number of mixed-income housing units. The design also includes “traffic-calming” measures, including more crosswalks, pedestrian-activated streetlights and at least one more stoplight, said Stantec Designer Nancy Locke.
“We’d love to slow that traffic down a little bit,” Locke said.

The $67 million the board authorized includes $6 million in “off-site” improvements detailed in the pre-development concepts, money that could go to the pedestrian safety measures. It includes about $2 million for intersection improvements, $2.6 million for sidewalk and landscape improvements and $140,000 to improve the existing bus stops there. 
While the board authorized the $67 million in bonding capacity for infrastructure, spending that money is still a good way off, Lujan Grisham said. The Legislature will also have to sign off when it meets in January, and then the state Finance Board will issue the bonds at a later date. 
And the funding for up to the $433 million in remaining bonding capacity the Legislature gave the Fair Board would come in subsequent phases. The governor and state Rep. Janelle Anyanonu (D-Albuquerque) said they might seek even more funding for the project at the January legislative session. 
Still, the governor said during Thursday’s meeting she’d like to see the project break ground before she leaves office at the end of next year, and she asked Locke if that was possible. 
“We’ll have to move fast,” Locke said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-30-at-2.27.16-PM-1024x571.png,,,2025-10-30 17:01:34.283367

In 2024-25, more than 24,700 high school juniors and seniors in Connecticut enrolled in college-level courses, an increase from 17,500 students three years prior. The 24,700 amounted to about 30% of high school juniors and seniors across the state. 
The trend follows a surge of state funding that was directed to the programs two years ago.
In the fall of 2023, the state announced it would use $3.8 million in federal pandemic emergency funds to help high schools add more college-level courses. Districts have since used that money to expand their offerings and pay teachers to write curriculum and become certified to teach a variety of disciplines. Connecticut’s education department also invested an additional $5 million of COVID funds in colleges and universities for the expansion of dual credit classes. 
Superintendents say they’ve shifted their focus when developing courses with an eye to the current job market. And some have begun to question the widely-accepted philosophy that every high school graduate should pursue a 4-year degree. 
“We see students always have to go to a four-year college,” said Joseph Macary, superintendent of Vernon Public Schools, at a roundtable discussion in Hartford on Thursday. “And that’s not what we want them to do. We want to try — and we are — diversifying to other courses that they don’t need a 4-year degree to do.” 
Subjects with the highest enrollment across Connecticut public high schools are social sciences, followed by physical and life sciences, mathematics and English language and literature.
Courses in some subjects have exploded. The number of business and marketing courses in particular have increased by 73% from last year — an increase that may be partly driven by a new financial literacy requirement for high schoolers in Connecticut. 
The number of students taking manufacturing courses has increased by 47%, and the number of students taking classes in healthcare and mathematics have increased by about a third. Enrollment in English and social sciences has grown also, though not as dramatically. 
Responding to business needs
John Maduko, chancellor of Connecticut State Colleges and Universities, said Connecticut’s workforce is facing an “existential threat” as the state’s population ages and Baby Boomers retire.
Specialty high school courses — and the apparent rising enrollment in those courses — could help address shortages of workers with needed skills.

Macary noted that military submarine manufacturer General Dynamics Electric Boat needs thousands of welders and other technicians in order to fulfill recent contracts with the United States Navy.
“I believe that we need to create systems and structures in our high schools that are responsive, that they can be agile enough to be responsive to the workforce,” said Macary. 
Anna Cutaia, superintendent of Milford Public Schools, said her district offers five career pathways — business management, allied health, computer science, education and government. She said district leaders are hoping to expand those offerings to include performing arts, cybersecurity and eSports. 
Cutaia said the school meets with industry representatives to hear what skills are needed for the current labor market. She said they have recently added industry certifications, which allow students to go directly into the workforce — or into an apprenticeship, technical school or a 2- or 4-year college degree program.
According to Cutaia, 80% of Milford’s seniors last year went on to a 4-year college, and 20% “are taking advantage” of the industry certificate they earned. 
Dual enrollment courses are also critical for colleges and universities as they work to attract new students and shore up their own student population.
Maduko said dual enrollment students make up 11% of CSCU’s total enrollment. He said this has helped offset some of the enrollment declines the system experienced during COVID. 
The University of Connecticut offers the most dual enrollment courses — serving about 30,000 students in partnership with nearly 200 high schools. 
CSCU offered classes to about 12,500 dual enrollment students last year, and private colleges offered about 3,700.
Jennifer Widness, president of the Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, said  some of the private universities in Connecticut have developed partnerships with certain high schools. 
Goodwin University, for example, has partnered with Wallingford Public Schools and other districts to offer advanced manufacturing courses. Mitchell College is developing healthcare and business tracks in partnership with New London Public Schools, while also working to launch a healthcare academy with Lawrence + Memorial Hospital. Quinnipiac University is offering  an apprenticeship program for teaching in partnership with East Haven and West Haven public schools. 
Improving access
Past reporting by the Connecticut Mirror found that access to dual enrollment classes varied significantly depending on resources available within each school district. Suburban districts tend to have greater college course offerings than rural or urban districts, driven in part by the availability of teachers who are certified to teach those classes and the stability of leadership. 
Ajit Gopalakrishnan, chief performance officer for the state Department of Education, told CT Mirror that the state was working with higher education institutions to make it easier for teachers to become accredited to teach dual enrollment courses. That includes moving away from the traditional assumption that teaching a college level course required a master’s degree in the subject of the course, he said, which many K-12 teachers don’t have.
Gopalakrishnan said the coronavirus funds have been put toward teacher stipends, to help cover the cost of any additional classes they need to become certified. 
Tom Yelich, chief of staff for CT State Community College, said in a statement that the college and the state provide funds for tuition and professional development for teachers taking graduate classes to be able to teach dual enrollment classes.
Maduko stressed the importance of making dual enrollment classes available for students who might not have otherwise considered college. He said that CSCU wanted to provide college-level courses to high schoolers who fall into what he calls the “academic middle.” 
“God bless the AP students, they are phenomenal. But we want to make sure that those students — and really their families that maybe at first never thought of college and the university being a reality — we can provide this opportunity to them while in high school,” he said. 
Data shows the state has made progress with increasing access to dual credit courses for students of color. Last year, the number of white high school students taking college courses increased by about 24% compared to the prior year. But the number of Black and Hispanic students taking college courses in high school rose 34% and 35.5%, respectively. 
Tadarrayl Starke, UConn’s vice provost for undergraduate student success, said that 44% of the students in UConn’s Early College Experience classes are first-generation, and that the fees were waived for about two in five students in those classes.
A stepping stone to higher ed
Students and superintendents at Thursday’s roundtable said dual enrollment classes had many benefits.
Kayla Markowitz, a student at Jonathan Law High School in Milford, said that taking a series of Advanced Placement courses helped her narrow down her interests. She now plans to attend a 4-year college and major in public policy. 
Markowitz and higher education leaders also said that taking college-level courses in high school gives students confidence in their ability to complete that level of education. And several higher education presidents and school superintendents pointed out the significant savings students can achieve when they complete college courses in high school.
Macary said students at Rockville High School in Vernon saved $1.5 million in college tuition through dual enrollment courses last year. 
A UConn Early College Experience course costs $50 per credit and is free for low-income students, compared to about $700 per credit for a traditional college class at UConn.
Dual and concurrent enrollment students at CT State Community College can take classes for free. In comparison, one credit at CT State Community College for an adult before financial aid costs about $300. 
According to state data, the percentage of students exhibiting “post-secondary readiness” has increased from about 44% to about 47% from the 2023-24 school year to 2024-25. This means they’ve either earned above a certain score on an Advanced Placement exam or earned three or more college credits through dual enrollment classes.
State Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker said that while it’s important to celebrate the progress being made, there’s also a lot of work that still needed to be done.  
This spring, lawmakers voted to include $6 million in the state budget in 2026-27 to offset the cost of dual credit courses. Officials at the State Department of Education say this is intended to be an annual appropriation.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023_1110_SR_CTColleges_018-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-30 17:01:34.283367

Wednesday’s state Senate Agriculture Committee Hearing focused almost exclusively on soybeans and cattle, two of the state’s top agricultural products. 
Soybeans are the state’s number-one crop, benefitting from easy access to the Mississippi river and New Orleans port. China is the world’s largest soybean importer and historically buys about half of all U.S. soybeans. However, since 2016 and the Trump administration’s first trade war, China has strategically shifted to buying more Brazilian soybeans. 
“It’s a real dilemma for us  in Mississippi and the Delta trying to decide where we go from here with our soybean crop,” said Duane Dunlap, president of DNS Commodities, to the committee. 
China did not buy any soybeans from the U.S. this year until Wednesday. On Thursday, after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Donald Trump posted on social media that China would begin buying “massive amounts” of U.S. soybeans.

But Dunlap thinks there’s also a market opportunity within Mississippi for soybeans.
Mississippi’s chickens, hogs and catfish all eat soybean meal but there are currently no soybean processing facilities in the state. So soybean meal is imported from other states. Dunlap pointed out that Mississippi is the largest soybean-producing state without a processor. He suggested that there’s an opportunity here to build a plant that could supply Mississippi farmers.
Beef prices are at record highs, driven by high demand and historically small herds. Trump has said that the U.S. could buy more beef from Argentina to bring prices down. This has led to push back and concern from U.S. cattle farmers. 
 ”Producers are just now starting to feel like they’re in recovery,” said Ethan Lane, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.

“Mission 3 is our region’s answer to a changing defense economy,” said Jamie Miller, President and CEO of the Gulf Coast Business Council.
In Fiscal Year 2023, federal defense spending made up 6% of Mississippi’s GDP. In 2021, the state established the Governor’s Office of Military Affairs to coordinate groups across the state.

(Photo by Julia Rendleman for New Jersey Monitor)It’s almost Halloween, which means it’s time to revisit one of my favorite New Jersey stories — that time Orson Welles pretended Martians had landed in the Garden State and were incinerating everyone in their path.
It’s also almost Election Day, which means it’s the perfect chance to explain what an 87-year-old radio play can teach voters about separating fact from fiction amid an onslaught of campaign trickery.

For the uninitiated, Welles’ radio adaptation of H.G. Wells’ “The War of the Worlds” aired on Halloween Eve 1938. Writer Howard Koch moved the setting of the novel from 19th-century England to 20th-century New Jersey, and made the start of the show sound like an orchestral concert interrupted every few minutes by increasingly dramatic news accounts reporting strange explosions on Mars, a strange cylindrical object falling onto a farm in the Grovers Mill section of West Windsor, and finally a monster exiting the UFO and waging war on the Garden State and beyond.
If you happened to miss the first few minutes of the broadcast, which made very clear that it was a fictional radio play, you may have thought you were listening to legitimate news of an alien invasion. And, sure enough, newspapers the next day were plastered with accounts of nationwide panic, some more believable than others.
The Herald News reported that the switchboard at Passaic Police Headquarters was “flooded with calls.”
The Courier-Post quoted someone from Grovers Mills named Old Bill Dock who said the radio show had him brandishing his double-barreled shotgun. “Thirty years since I fired her last,” he said, “but danged if I wouldn’t let her go last night if I could get a bead on ‘em.”
The Daily Home News said frightened people ran into the paper’s office and New Brunswick police headquarters to get info on the alleged war. “I couldn’t convince them that it was only a radio show,” said Lt. John Lyons.
Most other press accounts appear … less based in reality.
The New York Times wrote, “In San Francisco the general impression of listeners seemed to be that an overwhelming force had invaded the United States from the air, was in the process of destroying New York and threatening to move westward. ‘My God,’ roared one inquirer into a telephone, ‘where can I volunteer my services? We’ve got to stop this awful thing.’”
What inquirer? Who were they talking to? How did the Times know about this conversation? There’s a lot of chatter today about how untrustworthy the media is, but it seems like editorial standards were pretty loosey-goosey in 1938, even in the pages of the Gray Lady.
The front page of the Bergen Evening Record on Oct. 31, 1938, when newspapers made Americans believe there was a nationwide panic over a radio show.
For decades, the story of Welles’ “War of the Worlds” was a story about a gullible nation taken in by obviously fake news. But in recent years, Welles scholars and others have noted that, no, newspapers were the first to whip everyone into a frenzy by touting a nationwide panic that likely didn’t happen.
Michael J. Socolow, a University of Maine professor who teaches in the school’s journalism and communications department, said contemporaneous reports show hardly anyone listened to Welles’ show that night because it aired at the same time as the year’s most popular show, hosted by ventriloquist Edgar Bergen (yes, a ventriloquist on the radio). What really happened in the broadcast’s aftermath was the result of good-old-fashioned jealousy by newspaper owners who saw an opportunity to take down radio by painting Welles and radio broadcasters as irresponsible for scaring the daylights out of Americans, Socolow told me.
“Radio news was growing bigger and more important because we’re headed into World War II, with the Munich crisis happening one month before,” he said. “The American people are really starting to pay attention to radio news at an entirely new level. And that’s what had newspapers upset.”
Marguerite Rippy, an associate dean for graduate affairs at George Mason University who has studied Welles, called the broadcast and newspapers’ reaction to it “classic folklore.”
“The field of folklore studies how scary stories spread,” Rippy said. “We like to pass on stories. I think it’s the basis of who we are. And those storytelling moves happen both in Welles’ broadcast and in the media storytelling that came after. They’re both counter-folklore performance narratives that are operating with each other to create this other fantastic story that is very true about people, which is that we’re easily manipulated.”
And that brings me to the election. In four days, New Jersey voters will decide who becomes our next governor, Jack Ciattarelli (R) or Mikie Sherrill (D).
I know it’s naive to think candidates seeking office in 2025 would be honest with voters. But party leaders on both sides are engaging in the same kind of trickery that Welles used to make it sound like Martians had invaded Earth and that newspapers in 1938 employed to create the narrative that Welles’ radio play fooled people all over the United States.
Republicans have blanketed our airwaves with an ad claiming Sherrill bragged that clean energy initiatives she backed would “cost you an arm and a leg but if you’re a good person you’ll do it.” Sherrill did indeed use those words during a radio interview, but these GOP ads eliminate what she said right before. She said Democratic Party messaging about clean energy failed because it told voters it would “cost you an arm and a leg but if you’re a good person you’ll do it.” She was criticizing her party for lecturing people about clean energy, not lecturing voters herself.
Democrats have also been generous with the edit button. The party used a clip of Ciattarelli saying during a radio interview that “once you get outside our major urban centers, our most rural communities are just magnificent” to paint Ciattarelli as racist. Democrats even organized a press conference so the mayors of Plainfield, Orange, East Orange, Paterson, and Rahway could bash Ciattarelli for that comment — which he made on a podcast in response to a question about the best time to visit New Jersey if you don’t want to visit the Shore. Ciattarelli’s full comment was: “Fall is a magnificent season in New Jersey. The foliage is off the charts. And once you get outside our major urban centers, our most rural communities are just magnificent and there’s all kind of fall fests going on and pumpkin patches and farmland and hayrides. It’s magnificent.”
Like those listeners who may have tuned in late to Welles’ broadcast, voters who see both these edited clips are missing the context that makes them less scary. And like the newspaper editors in 1938 who took advantage of the fears of a nation dreading a march to war in Europe to target radio broadcasters vying for competition, Republicans and Democrats in New Jersey are using voters’ modern-day agita to make them believe their political leaders say all sorts of foolish things they never said.
I don’t fault voters who fall for the campaigns’ deceptiveness. Political operatives are taking advantage of voters who are anxious about racism or rising unaffordability and manipulating them by presenting them with ads that confirm their priors about the candidates and attempt to scare them into action. That is precisely what made it easy for newspaper editors in 1938 to convince people there had been a nationwide panic, Rippy told me.
“A smart manipulation presses on a panic point you already have,” she said.
Luckily, a little bit of media literacy helps cut through the B.S. Just like the portions of the “War of the Worlds” that sounded real had hints that it was all a lark, and just like newspapers’ accounts of the ensuing panic contained clues that a lot of the claims were bunk, today’s campaign of misinformation signals to viewers who pay attention that it is not legit. The very obvious edits of Sherrill’s and Ciattarelli’s statements in the examples cited above are a tell-tale sign that you are being manipulated. Ask yourself why a campaign would want you to hear just a seconds-long segment of their political opponent’s longer statement. The answer is they want to fool you. Don’t let them.

The business leaders mingled and heard politicians speak at the Mississippi Economic Council’s annual Hobnob event. MEC is preparing to merge with two other organizations in 2026 to form the Mississippi Business Alliance.
Scott Waller, president and CEO of the Economic Council, called the merger “an unprecedented step forward” that will propel the state’s business community and economy.
“Business drives the future for our state,” said John McKay, president and CEO of the Mississippi Manufacturers Association. He will lead the new organization.
The Alliance will be the state’s new chamber of commerce. It will bring together MEC, the Mississippi Manufacturers Association and the Business and Industry Political Education Committee. 
Gov. Tate Reeves said the new group will help build “a bigger, stronger Mississippi in the years to come.”
The state’s top politicians, all Republicans, on Thursday spoke about wide range of topics during the casual gathering at the Mississippi Coliseum in Jackson.
Reeves said the state now has “the strongest economy” in its history.
“No state, and I mean no state, is hotter than Mississippi,” he said.
But others leaders offered warnings of major challenges or problems.

Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson said Mississippi is in the midst of an “agriculture crisis,” from high input costs for farmers and global trade wars that have sapped overseas sales of commodities.
But he said solutions are in the works, including a soybean trade deal with China announced by President Donald Trump this week. He also said Mississippi’s geography, with plenty of fertile land and water, promises a brighter future.
Gipson said lack of water in other parts of the U.S. will within 20 years turn the Southeast into “the food production center for the country.” 
Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney said Mississippi being the only state without a robust mitigation program to strengthen housing stock against hurricanes and other natural disasters could spell doom for the state’s insurance market, and economy at-large.
“Some gaslighting members of the state Legislature decided (earlier this year) they would kill the program to mitigate houses,” Chaney said. “Now, we’re the only state without a mitigation program.”
Chaney also warned of major, continuing problems with access to health care and of the potential for hundreds of thousands of Mississippians to lose health coverage amid the ongoing battle in Washington over the federal Affordable Care Act.
House Speaker Jason White told the business leaders they should support his push in the coming legislative session for expanding “school choice,” or “education freedom.” This push, coming from the Trump administration, would include using public tax dollars for private schools and allowing families more choices in their children’s education. White said it would help with workforce development, better training Mississippi students for jobs.
White also said the House plans to tackle another major issue for businesses by pushing to raise the corporate tax credit for spending on child care for employees to 100%, or “dollar-for-dollar” of what companies spend.
Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann told the audience Thursday that state economic growth hinges on three things: “Good schools, a trained workforce and a solid housing market.”
“This year, the Senate will be addressing all of these,” Hosemann said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30123917/Mississippi-Economic-Council-annual-Hobnob16B.jpg,,,2025-10-30 16:21:22.122332

The state has declared a limited State of Emergency, SNAP benefits to continue despite a federal shutdown.
WILMINGTON — Delaware families who receive SNAP (food stamps) face a Monday recertification deadline that could interrupt November benefits for households whose certification periods end in October. At the same time, the state has declared a limited State of Emergency, so benefits can continue despite a federal shutdown that would otherwise halt payments.
Gov. Matt Meyer, on Wednesday, declared an emergency order, authorizing Delaware to load SNAP benefits week-to-week in November with state funds and to boost support for food banks and pantries if needed. The order cites more than 120,000 Delawareans relying on SNAP each month. The administration emphasized the measure is temporary and intended to prevent an abrupt lapse while federal payments are suspended.
Republican legislative leaders publicly backed keeping benefits flowing but urged Meyer to use uncommitted state dollars first and, if necessary, call the General Assembly into session. In letters this week, GOP caucuses suggested redirecting money earmarked for the Legislative Hall parking garage project and portions of the state’s ERP cloud migration budget, with backfilling once federal operations resume.
The emergency order follows a USDA memo stating it would not deploy federal contingency funds for November SNAP during the shutdown and would not reimburse states that self-fund benefits—leaving states to decide whether to cover the gap. Several states, including Delaware, have now acted, according to reports in Reuters.
Meanwhile, the Delaware Division of Social Services (DSS) says many SNAP households still must complete routine recertification by Monday to avoid a separate interruption unrelated to the shutdown. Renewals can be submitted through the Delaware ASSIST portal or at State Service Centers. DSS reminds clients to provide income, housing and household documentation; missing items can delay approval.
Local nonprofits, including the Food Bank of Delaware, are preparing for increased demand if families miss the cutoff or experience processing delays, even with the state’s emergency funding in place. Advocates have stepped up outreach through social media, churches and community partners to prevent gaps.
What families should do now?


Check if you’re due to renew: This applies to households whose certification period ends in October. Delaware Health and Social Services


Recertify by Monday: Submit online via Delaware ASSIST or return your mailed packet to DSS; include income, rent/mortgage, utilities and household size documentation.

The big picture


State action: Delaware will fund weekly SNAP loads in November while federal payments are suspended, under a State of Emergency signed Oct. 29.


GOP stance: Support for continuity of benefits, coupled with calls to reprioritize specific state funds and, if needed, reconvene lawmakers. See House Republicans’ open letter.


Why it’s urgent: A federal memo says USDA will not use contingency funds for November and won’t reimburse states that pay on their own.

While Iowa has not moved to provide state backing for SNAP benefits as some other states have considered, Reynolds announced the state will provide “interim support” for Iowa food banks and pantries if SNAP benefits end as expected.
These supports include plans to deploy Iowa National Guard members for active duty, conducting food distribution missions throughout the state, as well as planned meetings with the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services and Volunteer Iowa to recruit and deploy volunteers “to support food assistance operations in communities across the state where help is needed.”
Additionally, Reynolds directed Iowa HHS to use existing state funds to match cash donations to the state’s six regional food banks up to $1 million, beginning Nov. 3, if the shutdown continues.
“Government plays an important role in supporting its citizens, but we each have a personal responsibility to care for the people in our communities, especially those in need,” Reynolds said in a statement. “That’s why the state will match up to $1 million in contributions made by Iowans for regional food banks across our state. Together, we can make an even bigger difference for our neighbors who need help during this time.”
A spokesperson for the Des Moines Area Religious Council said their organization was “grateful for the office of the governor’s work to create an emergency response for Iowans in need.”
“This increased collaboration and communication with Iowa HHS and agencies like DMARC is an important step to remove barriers for our neighbors as they navigate an incredibly difficult time,” Blake Willadsen, communications manager for DMARC said. “SNAP is our nation’s most effective tool for fighting hunger, and the loss of it this November will be felt especially hard by families, children, and seniors across our state.”
Food banks, pantries and other organizations said last week they expect to see “unprecedented” need across the state if SNAP benefits end, as the food assistance program serves roughly 270,000 Iowans each month. In addition to the state’s response, there have also been several private organizations pledging support for these entities in the coming week.
Local businesses including Big Grove Brewery and The Big Grove for Good Foundation have announced plans to donate a total of $12,000 to three Iowa food banks, Hy-Vee will donate $100,000 to food banks in its regions and Fareway and the Iowa Pork Producers Association are collaborating to donate $20,000 worth of pork to food banks across the state.
The three Medicaid managed care organizations in Iowa, Iowa Total Care, Molina Healthcare of Iowa, and Wellpoint Iowa, have also committed to donate $100,000 to support Iowa food banks, according to the governor’s news release.
Food insecurity impairs learning, teachers’ union says
Advocates say the lapse of SNAP benefits will have major implications for Iowans in all aspects of life — including education. Iowa State Education Association President Joshua Brown said students who experience chronic food insecurity face greater challenges in learning and retaining information, and called on members of Congress to pass a “bipartisan funding bill that prioritizes the welfare of our citizens, especially our most vulnerable.”
“We are frustrated and disappointed, and we are here to demand change,” Brown said. “The Iowa congressional delegation and other elected leaders in Washington — this is your moral test, and you are currently failing. You are fighting over budget lines and political talking points while children are going to bed, worried about whether where their next meal is going to come from. You are treating the future of our children as a bargaining chip in a game of partisan politics.”
U.S. Sens. Klobuchar, Baldwin join Iowans to call for extended ACA tax credits

Members of Iowa’s all Republican federal delegation have supported measures to provide funding for SNAP if the shutdown continues. U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks introduced a bill Friday to let the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture access emergency funds to maintain SNAP operations during the shutdown.
On Monday, U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn toured the Food Bank of Iowa and called for Democrats to support the continuing resolution passed in the House — a short-term funding bill that does not include Democrats’ language on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits — in order to prevent SNAP benefits from being halted.
“This shutdown is threatening food on the table for hundreds of thousands of Iowa families—many of them kids, new moms, and seniors,” Nunn said in a statement. “We cannot expect Iowa food banks and families to pay for Washington’s dysfunction. I’m calling on Senate Democrats to set partisanship aside and pass our clean continuing resolution before we reach the funding cliff.”
But Democrats have criticized House Republicans for refusing to negotiate on the ACA enhanced tax credits and other issues. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart criticized Iowa’s GOP House delegation for not working to reconvene and negotiate a deal with Democrats to reopen the government.
“The USDA has the money to feed hungry Iowans in November, but the Trump administration is refusing to release these funds,” Hart said in a statement. “Instead of working to ensure veterans, mothers, and children can access the food they need, Republicans are using people’s lives as leverage to continue playing political games. Iowa families should not have to worry about putting food on the table because of Washington gridlock. It’s time for Republicans to do their job and put people before politics.”

Andy Beshear, a Democrat, has long supported implementing universal pre-K statewide.(Alabama Reflector photo by Stew Milne)A committee established by Gov. Andy Beshear, tasked with researching universal preschool, says Kentucky should expand access to pre-K. 
In June, Beshear signed an executive order establishing the Pre-K for All Advisory Committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky. 
Sam Flynn, the executive director for the Team Kentucky Pre-K for All Program, said Thursday that the group found, over the course of four months of meetings and town halls, that Kentucky’s children are not ready for kindergarten and about 27% of children in the state have access to pre-K. 
Early learning sets kids on life trajectory, Kentuckians hear, as Beshear keeps pushing for pre-K

The committee presented Beshear with a report on their findings. They also shared details from the report during Beshear’s weekly press conference Thursday. 
According to the report:  

Kentucky’s early care system is fragmented, offering early care and education through a patchwork approach of programs with inconsistent eligibility rules, funding sources, affordability and access. 
Kentucky’s existing system is inadequate. Childcare is often unaffordable and inaccessible, leaving parents forced out of the workforce and children not ready for school. 
Several states have successfully expanded access to preschool for all four year olds. 
Successful pre-k programs focus on quality,  offer flexible, mixed delivery of services and use strong data systems. 

“We believe that these findings can provide us not only a clear view of the challenges we face, but a direction and a path forward,” said Felicia Cumings Smith, board chair of the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence and a committee member. “Based on these findings, this committee has issued recommendations charting a path forward for the governor, the General Assembly and all Kentuckians.” 
Based on the findings, the committee made these reccomendations:

Kentucky should expand its existing voluntary state funded public preschool program responsibly, in phases, over several years.
Expansion should ensure local flexibility on when and how expansion will occur, with decisions being made at the local level with support from the Kentucky Department of Education. 
Kentucky should provide services through mixed, integrated school district -led partnerships with Head Start, private regulated child care and community based providers. 
Expansion should prioritize quality. 
The General Assembly should authorize the Kentucky Department of Education to establish administrative regulations with the focus on district local flexibilities for things like facilities, transportation and educator requirements. 
Kentucky should track success through a unified data collection system. 

“I know how education positively impacts the lives of our people,” said Carrie Ballinger, superintendent of Rockcastle County Schools. “I see it every single day. Getting kids a stronger start is crucial to their development and to their long term academic success.” 
Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman said pre-K “isn’t political” but “the right thing to do.” 
“It is clear that Kentucky needs pre-K for all,” Coleman said. “It will expand access to childcare and learning. It will give parents and caregivers options and help them to save money. It’ll create jobs and boost our workforce, and we’re getting right to work to get this done for Kentucky, for our families, our businesses and for our future.” 
Beshear, a Democrat, has long supported implementing universal pre-K statewide. He called on Republicans in the state legislature’s supermajority to fund such initiatives in his State of the Commonwealth Address earlier this year. However, top Republicans said then that their caucuses did not have a consensus on the matter.

(Getty Images)Starting Jan. 1, individuals carrying health insurance through Highmark BlueCross BlueShield will no longer be covered for any services rendered through the Kanawha County Emergency Ambulance Authority, according to a news release from the authority.
Per the release, the Kanawha ambulance authority is canceling its contract with Highmark after the ambulatory service and insurance agency failed to agree on a new contract that would have seen Highmark “adequately reimburse” KCEAA for its services.
No one will be turned away for service, the release read, but some people who were previously covered will soon be considered uninsured and will be on the hook to pay the full, out of pocket costs of the services rendered.
Highmark BlueCross BlueShield serves about 250,000 people in West Virginia and holds the largest share of the commercial insurance market in the state. 
Cathy McAlister, the director of corporate communications at Highmark BlueCross BlueShield West Virginia said Thursday that the insurance provider follows standards set by the federal Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services and pays those same rates.
“We provided Kanawha County Emergency Ambulance Authority data that showed that our reimbursement was aligned with the industry and agreed to some select increases,” McAlister said in an emailed statement. “It was Kanawha County Emergency Ambulance Authority that terminated their agreement with us, per their contact rights. We regret their decision and recognize the challenges faced by EMS providers but believe the issue cannot be resolved by commercially insured individuals alone.”
Tom Susman, a spokesman for Kanawha County Emergency Ambulance Authority, said the ambulance authority isn’t asking Highmark to solve all of those challenges, however.“We’re just asking them to pay their fair share and not have the other folks in Kanawha County pick up their tab,” Susman said. “That’s all this is.”
According to the release from the ambulance authority, Highmark agreed in negotiations to increase payments by “a small amount.” That amount, however, was “not enough” for the ambulance authority to sustain its services.
Susman said most of the people who will be impacted by the contract termination are ones who receive Highmark BlueCross BlueShield coverage individually or commercially through their employers.
If those individuals are treated or transported by KCEAA starting on Jan. 1, they will be charged the full cost of providing EMS services without any insurance coverage or discount.
People who are covered by Medicare or Medicare Advantage plans through Highmark should still receive the insured discount for emergency transportations due to federal regulations that require a certain amount of coverage — and reimbursement — for Medicare beneficiaries, Susman said. Non-emergency services, however, may not be covered at the same level.
Susman said that the ambulance service is “just trying to be paid fairly.” 
“Something has got to give. We’re not asking for a horrible amount of money here; we’re asking for enough to keep us afloat and for what is fair for the services we’re providing,” Susman said. “We as a service provider don’t have the luxury of saying no [to patients], and of course we wouldn’t turn anyone down because of their insurance — but these services do cost money and we want what we’re owed.”
Susman said about 75% of revenue for Kanawha’s ambulance authority comes from reimbursements after treating patients covered by the Public Employees Insurance Agency, Medicare and Medicaid. 
Highmark, he continued, paid less in reimbursement rates than PEIA. 
“We are sorry that Highmark BlueCross BlueShield doesn’t see the need to support KCEAA’s services adequately,” said Monica Mason, executive director of KCEAA, in the news release. “This is not something we want to do. Unfortunately, KCEAA is fighting a deficit and must require all insurers to pay their fair share for its services.”
KCEAA said in its release that it “remains hopeful” that a better contract can be negotiated with Highmark over the next 60 days. The current contract requires a 30-day notice for cancellation. By giving the 60 days, Susman said older people looking at Medicare Advantage plans and companies deciding health insurance for their employees will have enough time to consider other options since KCEAA will no longer be an in-network provider.
Chris Hall, the executive director of the West Virginia EMS Coalition, said the pressure building at KCEAA is similar to that for ambulance providers throughout the state, and “inadequate” reimbursement rates are a large part of the issue.
If EMS agencies receive low reimbursement rates, the remaining cost for services — up to almost $500 per an ambulance call, Hall said — are passed on to taxpayers. 
“EMS relies solely on patient care revenue and taxpayer support to fund its operations. Insurance reimbursements typically fall drastically short of covering the actual costs. And like a hospital emergency room, EMS is obligated to provide care regardless of a patient’s insurance status,” Hall said in an emailed statement. “If EMS agencies are underpaid, taxpayers bear the cost or emergency services become less available, which strains local budgets and jeopardizes care quality and access.”
Mason, in the news release, said that an increase in reimbursements is necessary to keep ambulance services operating in Kanawha County.
“In the past five years, more than 30 EMS providers across West Virginia have disbanded partly because some insurers have not paid them sufficiently to support their services,” Mason said. “We cannot let that happen to KCEAA.”

Shots were fired Saturday at the front of the regional prison in Mayersville. At least one shot hit a window as visitors, inmates and staff were inside, according to a Wednesday statement from the Issaquena County Sheriff’s Department. 
Prison Warden Don Brown issued a memo Sunday to all held at the facility: Due to the recent shooting, visitation would be suspended until further notice “for the safety of the visitors, the inmates and staff.”
Sheriff Waye Windham was not immediately available for comment Thursday to offer details about the shooting. Information about identification of those involved in the shooting and whether any charges have been filed was not immediately known. 
A correctional facility staff member reached Thursday declined to say whether visitation is still suspended or if the facility is in a lockdown. 
The sheriff’s office contacted the Mississippi Department of Corrections, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics to assist with the investigation. 
Spokespeople from MDOC and the Department of Public Safety referred questions to the sheriff’s office.

“These LGBTQ plus folks made their mark in Vermont history, but there are so many others upon whose shoulders we stand, those who aren't as well known or haven't yet been discovered,” the presenter said.

Vermont, the first state in the country to legalize civil unions, has a storied history supporting LGBTQ rights. Last week, a crowd gathered to hear speakers illuminate historical figures who championed the cause, and hear about a gathering place that served as a safe haven for the LGBTQ+ community.
The Andrews Inn, run as a restaurant, inn, gay bar and disco club from the 1973 to 1984 at the heart of downtown Bellows Falls, was a magnet for people from all corners of the East Coast and southern Canada. But the inn, which served as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community in Bellows Falls for a decade, is largely unknown in the collective imagination of Vermont today, said Andrew Ingall.
Ingall is a scholar and performer who organized a series of talks this fall, sponsored by the Vermont Humanities 2025 Fall Festival “Resilient Patterns,” on his family history, Andrews Inn and legacy of LGBTQ+ caregiving in the state.
Around 45 people poured into the Rockingham Free Public Library in Bellows Falls on Oct. 25 to learn about and remember the stories of older LGBTQ+ adults and ancestors in Vermont’s history.
Thom Herman, one of the former innkeepers and owners, said the gathering was a cathartic experience, remembering the many joyful and meaningful experiences at the inn such as the Yellow Rose Ball, which was held in honor of a local high school girl who died. 
“When I left April Fool’s Day, 1984 and closed the inn, I left with a lot of trauma,” Herman said. “I never would have imagined that 40 years later, people would be celebrating and giving me a chance to heal and appreciate some of the wonderful things, friendships that still are happening to this day.”
As much as Andrews Inn was a LGBTQ+ community hub, it also drew detractors and homophobic attacks from the local community. The tension heightened after a male prostitution sting operation played out at the inn in 1983, said Gail Golec, a historian and member of the Bellows Falls Pride group.

The news tarnished the Andrews Inn’s reputation and economic viability, even though the inn’s owners did not know about the activities, the subjects of the raid had never visited the inn prior, and all charges were eventually dropped, Golec said. The building shuttered a year later. 
Golec has produced a podcast series and is working on an upcoming documentary on the Andrews Inn. She said she was intrigued by the Andrews Inn’s setting in a rural, economically disadvantaged Vermont community amid the AIDS crisis and growing LGBTQ+ rights movement. 
“I think it’s a fascinating history of the inn, but it’s also the wider story is about how people take care of each other,” Golec said. “It’s about how everybody looked after each other and how people found family and found community.”
Jeremy Youst, Herman’s partner and the other former inn owner, said opening the inn in Bellows Falls was “nourishing.” He told the crowd creating spaces for community connection helps remind people “we’re a part of something bigger than ourselves.”

Tracing his own family tree, Ingall found that his father’s cousin, Léon Ingall, settled not far from Bellows Falls in Townshend in 1980 with lifelong partner Warren Kronemeyer. The couple opened an European antique shop called Warlé, which is the namesake of his research, the “Warlé” project.
Ingall said Léon was a fashion designer who escaped Nazi Germany, and enlisted in the U.S. Army. During his service in World War II, Ingall said Léon met Warren, who worked as a journalist in France. The couple opened an interior decor shop in New York City before moving to Vermont, Ingall said.
Later in life, Ingall said Warren and Léon’s property has been transformed into an affordable senior living community called Valley Village. The center is LGBTQ+ affirming and inclusive, Ingall said, and a “beautiful legacy” of his ancestor and partner.
Ingall also discussed research into a couple named Charity and Sylvia, who were considered a married couple in Weybridge under the term “help-meet” in the 19th century, long before civil unions or gay marriages were legal in the state. In the Shaker tradition, Charity and Sylvia used an adult-sized “granny cradle” to rock their partners during illness, a profound symbol of LGBTQ+ caregiving, Ingall said.

An upcoming event on Nov. 8 in Middlebury will highlight the research on Charity and Sylvia, along with bringing the story of Warren, Léon and the Andrews Inn to life. The event will bring together speakers from the Henry Sheldon Museum of Vermont and performer Maestro Clemmons, best known for his role in the PBS television show “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood.” Ingall said he hopes to again weave together these stories to help foster social connection and appreciation of older LGBTQ+ adults and ancestors. 
Community hubs and spaces like the Andrews Inn serving the LGBTQ+ community in rural Vermont are even more needed today after the loneliness epidemic was declared a public health crisis by the U.S. surgeon general in 2023, Ingall said.
Ingall noted there are higher rates of economic insecurity, food insecurity, anxiety, depression and social isolation for older LGBTQ+ adults, and he hopes the discussion will spark ideas of what community care could look like in the future. 
“I also see the theme of care and caregiving as a common thread between Warren and Léon, Thom and Jeremy and Charity and Sylvia,” Ingall said. “These LGBTQ+ folks made their mark in Vermont history, but there are so many others upon whose shoulders we stand, those who aren’t as well known or haven’t yet been discovered.”

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Prosecutors allege a Washington state man repeatedly posted “veiled death threats” to Gov. Bob Ferguson on social media, including pictures of the front door of the governor’s home. 
Casey Cutter Patterson, 34, is also accused of posting a picture of an AR-15 in August and referring to Ferguson’s security detail. A search warrant revealed he’d requested public records about the “personal security detail” of Ferguson’s predecessor, former Gov. Jay Inslee. 
Patterson is charged with making “threats against governor or family” as well as intimidating a public servant. Both are felony charges. He remained in county jail Thursday.
At his arraignment Tuesday, he pleaded not guilty. 
Pierce County Superior Court Commissioner Barbara McInvaille set bail for Patterson at $200,000. McInvaille also issued a no-contact order barring Patterson from trying to communicate with Ferguson for 10 years.
The charges come amid increasing concerns over the safety of elected officials and political figures, after the killings this year of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and Minnesota state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband. 
On Oct. 5, a man reportedly dealing with mental health issues broke into the state Capitol and committed vandalism inside, according to charges. No one was injured.
Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste said this month that a staffer at the Washington State Fusion Center had been tasked with focusing on potential threats to Washington state lawmakers.
Patterson, of Lakewood, started replying to Ferguson’s social media posts when Ferguson was state attorney general, according to criminal charges filed this month in Pierce County Superior Court.
In one response, Patterson reportedly told the Democrat, who was running for governor at the time, that he was “coming for your lunch money” and “I’m going to make you cry.” 
At first, the defendant’s posts appeared to be protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, according to charging papers. They were more like those of an upset constituent.
But his rhetoric escalated, prosecutors allege.
In March 2024, Patterson told Ferguson on social media, “You’re a criminal, and we’re going to treat you like one,” with a picture of the front door to the now-governor’s home, according to the charges. 
At first, Washington State Patrol investigators couldn’t tell if Patterson took the photo or obtained it by other means. However, they later determined the suspect had taken the photo himself.
A state patrol lieutenant called Patterson to tell him the posts with Ferguson’s front door were concerning to authorities and the then-attorney general. 
“Mr. Ferguson does not want to be contacted, follow, tracked, or monitored in his personal life,” the lieutenant reportedly told Patterson. 
Patterson was agreeable, telling the lieutenant he didn’t threaten Ferguson, according to court papers. 
After that call, Patterson stopped replying to Ferguson’s posts for months. Though he resumed in late November 2024, after Ferguson had been elected governor, the charges say.
In response to an X post about the governor-elect, Patterson wrote, “I know he’s worried about his address, which is public information. He had WSP contact me for tweeting a picture of his front door. I’m going to keep tweeting it,” according to the charges.
“Bob Ferguson might have me blocked from both of his accounts on here, but I hope he sees this,” Patterson reportedly posted two days later, with pictures of Ferguson’s door and his address taken from public records filed with the state Public Disclosure Commission.
Over the next couple months, Patterson posted the pictures multiple times, prosecutors allege. 
Once Ferguson took office in January, he got a new official X account, where Patterson wasn’t blocked. So the suspect began replying to Ferguson’s posts again, according to court documents. 
“I’m going to throw out a hypothetical,” Patterson reportedly responded in one example. “If the people of Washington came to collect for the crimes you’ve committed, how confident are you with your Personal Security Detail?”
For months, he posted veiled threats to Ferguson, the charges say. In August, for example, the defendant wrote to the governor on X that he was “going to bully the [expletive] out of you, and I know where you live.”
The posts started mentioning guns in October, according to the charges. In one case, he wrote, “we have more guns than you, and we know where you live. [Expletive] around and find out.” 
In another he says “we have more guns than you and your [Washington State Patrol security detail], and we know where you live.”

“Patterson’s posts have escalated over time and show that he has made substantial steps toward threatening behavior,” a Washington State Patrol detective wrote in a police report. “Based on the totality of the evidence, Patterson’s repeated posts, imagery, and statements directed at Governor Ferguson appear to constitute a credible threat intended to cause fear and potential harm.”
On Monday, authorities arrested Patterson via warrant because they feared he would turn to violence if issued a court summons to appear in his criminal case.
A LinkedIn profile that matches Patterson’s name and photo on X indicates he is a former hospital corpsman with the U.S. Navy and has worked in security since 2019.

(Photo by Patrick Coolican/Minnesota Reformer)Halloween has become a tale of two traditions: The classic, house-to-house trick-or-treating, and the modern, centralized trunk-or-treat event, where families gather in parking lots to collect candy from decorated cars. 
While both are enjoyable, just one truly serves a vital civic purpose: building the social connections our communities increasingly lack.
Trunk-or-treat events offer undeniable benefits, especially in rural Minnesota communities where homes are far apart. These events provide a safe, efficient and inclusive venue for every child to participate. Furthermore, they are excellent outreach opportunities for businesses, churches and civic groups to engage with families and promote their organizations.
When trunk-or-treating supplants traditional neighborhood trick-or-treating, however, we sacrifice something invaluable.
The power of the porch light and the calendar
Traditional trick-or-treating is not just about candy — it is a community ritual disguised as a holiday. For one evening a year, it forces us out of our isolated homes and onto the sidewalk, creating a casual, low-pressure setting for residents to meet.
Trick-or-treating builds trust. Walking up to a neighbor’s door and being greeted warmly, even briefly, breaks down the invisible barriers we often erect. It humanizes the people living next door and chips away at the pervasive, unproven myth that our neighbors are a threat.
Trick-or-treating also fosters social cohesion: These small interactions are the building blocks of a resilient community. They establish the “eyes on the street” that increase a neighborhood’s collective sense of safety long after the jack-o’-lanterns are put away.
Crucially, trunk-or-treats often occur on a weekend afternoon or a different day altogether, a schedule designed for convenience. 
But the magic of building community in cities and towns is tied to October 31st. When community organizations or cities attempt to shift the focus away from the actual holiday — or when neighboring municipalities establish differing “official” times — it fragments the very ritual that’s meant to unify. 
The tradition thrives when we collectively agree that Halloween night belongs to the neighborhoods in large cities and the overall community of smaller cities and towns, typically during the informal but widely accepted hours at dusk and after.
A community-focused compromise
We can address modern safety concerns without abandoning the neighborhood. Instead of viewing these two traditions as an “either/or” choice, we should explore a “both/and” approach.
For neighborhoods grappling with concerns about darkness or porch access, consider a sidewalk table model. Neighbors can set up decorated tables or stations right on their lawn or sidewalk.

Two groups who sued over congressional and legislative districts two years ago asked the federal judges to allow them to amend their complaints to include the new 1st District, whose boundaries legislative Republicans approved last week.
One group of plaintiffs includes Common Cause, the North Carolina NAACP, and individual voters. The other lawsuit was filed on behalf of nearly two dozen Black and Latino voters. 
Republicans redrew the district at the behest of President Donald Trump, who is seeking to maximize Republican U.S. House wins in the midterm election.
The previous version of the 1st District, drawn for the 2024 election, was already the subject of the consolidated lawsuits filed in 2023. Plaintiffs claimed that Republicans in the General Assembly approved legislative and congressional districts that diluted the power of Black voters. 
The three-judge panel heard arguments in the case last summer but has not issued an opinion. 
The latest 1st District boundaries, established last week, dismantle the Black Belt, counties in northeastern and eastern North Carolina with a bloc of Black voters. Those voters have helped elect Black members to Congress since 1992. 
The 1st District was the only competitive congressional district in the state last year. Incumbent Democratic Rep. Don Davis narrowly won a second term. 
The group of plaintiffs including Common Cause, the NC NAACP, and individual voters, says legislators made the district even worse in retaliation for opponents filing the lawsuit. 
The updated complaint filed by individual Black and Latino voters said Republicans in the legislature violated the Constitution and federal law in targeting Black voters.

DemasMembers of the Michigan Senate on Thursday voted to advance a supplemental funding bill providing $71 million in state funds to support food assistance with federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, or SNAP, set to come to a halt on Saturday. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service instructed state officials to pause SNAP benefits in November, citing a lapse in funding due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
Senate Bill 182, passed the chamber 27-4, with Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), Sens. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake) Dan Lauwers (R-Brockway Township) and Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe) making up the “nay” votes. The bill would allocate $50 million to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services for emergency food assistance, alongside an addition $10 million for food bank grants and another $10 million for the Agricultural Surplus System Program, which the Food Bank Council of Michigan uses to purchase excess produce, protein and dairy from Michigan farmers. 
The bill also allocates $1 million to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for the Double Up Food Bucks program, which matches EBT/Bridge Card or food stamp dollars spent on fruits and vegetables at participating stores, allowing recipients to access twice the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables. 
Michigan House Democrats put forth their own proposal to backfill SNAP Benefits earlier this week, proposing $600 million intended to cover two months of lost benefits. 
State steps up food bank stopgap funding 
While neither the Senate plan passed Thursday, nor the House Democrats’ plan outlined Wednesday, have much chance of being taken up in the GOP-led House, there was some funding put forward to plug the expected hole in the food assistance safety net.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office announced that the state will provide $4.5 million to the Food Bank Council of Michigan to support food banks and pantries throughout the state. 
“Today, in light of the USDA’s decision to freeze SNAP, the State of Michigan is taking action to support the Food Bank Council of Michigan so they can continue feeding families in all 83 counties and deliver food to those who are unable to drive,” Whitmer said in a press release. “We take care of each other in Michigan, and we will continue bringing together public and private philanthropic resources to feed people as we hit day 30 of the federal government shutdown and approach the November 1 pause of SNAP.”
About 1.4 million Michigan residents use SNAP, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and in Fiscal Year 2024, benefits averaged to $173 per recipient each month — meaning that total benefits would total over $240 million per month. 
“Because we did the right thing and kept state government on the job, we are now able to step up with this critical support for our local food banks, ensuring they have the resources they need to protect our communities and keep Michigan families strong,” Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said in the press release. 
“But this will never be a long-term solution and state government can only make up so much of the federal government’s spending. Congress must follow our lead and keep more Michigan families from being hurt by this shutdown,” Hall added.
Whitmer also led a letter, sent early Thursday and signed by 21 other Democratic governors, calling on President Trump to release SNAP contingency funds.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)More than 100 congressional Democrats are pushing Attorney General Pamela Bondi to restore withheld funding and rescind new grant restrictions that have left providers of domestic violence services in New Jersey and beyond scrambling for support.
In a letter sent Thursday to Bondi and obtained by the New Jersey Monitor, the lawmakers said the Department of Justice’s actions have effectively halted access to Violence Against Women Act grants that nonprofits have relied on since 1994 to provide victims with counseling, legal advocacy, emergency and transitional housing, and more.
New Jersey providers have gotten no VAWA funding this year to support victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking, despite getting $11.2 million last year and an average of $9.1 million in grants a year since 2020, according to federal data. The feds have distributed just $9 million of this funding to 29 grantees across the country so far this year, compared to $684 million to 880 grantees last year, federal data shows.
At the same time, domestic violence has risen in New Jersey in recent years, with police reporting nearly 71,000 incidents, including 57 fatalities, in 2023, according to the state police’s most recent domestic violence report.
“The lives, safety, and well-being of survivors across the country depend on swift and decisive action,” the House lawmakers wrote in Thursday’s letter.
Four members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation — Reps. Josh Gottheimer, LaMonica McIver, Nellie Pou, and Bonnie Watson Coleman, all Democrats — signed the letter.
The lawmakers’ letter comes a month after a coalition of states, including New Jersey, sued Bondi and the Justice Department over new restrictions that condition VAWA and other funding that support victims’ services on the ideological goals of President Donald Trump’s administration.
The restrictions are rooted primarily in two memos Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued in February and May ordering federal officials to eliminate diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility considerations from federal programs, policies, and funding, or face investigation and penalties under the federal False Claims Act.
Those memos and the “vague and burdensome” requirements they impose on nonprofits seeking grants undermine “both the letter and spirit of VAWA,” the lawmakers wrote. The Violence Against Women Act requires grant recipients to comply with antidiscrimination requirements.
“The threat of federal investigation or civil enforcement — especially for small, under-resourced nonprofits — poses an unacceptable barrier to accessing funds that Congress has explicitly appropriated to serve survivors of gender-based violence,” the lawmakers wrote.
The Congress members also are objecting to a Justice Department plan to reduce the Office on Violence Against Women’s budget by nearly 30% and merge it into the Office of Justice Programs, calling those moves “directly at odds with congressional intent.” In 2022, Congress reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act and strengthened the office’s statutory protections to prevent such consolidation, they wrote.
“The Department has a responsibility to uphold the commitments made by Congress under VAWA and to avoid placing critical support for survivors and their service providers at risk,” they wrote.
The letter comes six months after a bipartisan coalition of Congress members sent a similar plea when funding threats first emerged.

The Senate version of Trump’s budget reconciliation bill failed to garner enough votes to pass, resulting in a nearly month-long shutdown that began on October 1. At the crux of the bill’s failure – and the reason why the government hasn’t reopened – is whether to fund Biden-era health insurance subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act that are set to expire at the end of this year.
 


 
The subsidies lower monthly premiums for consumers who obtain coverage through private health insurance marketplaces that were created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014. These subsidies were meant to help people who don’t qualify for Medicaid, are too young to receive Medicare, and whose employer doesn’t offer a private health insurance plan.
If the GOP slashes funding for these subsidies, enrollees will be forced to either pay for the entire premium out of pocket, if they can afford it, or abandon health insurance altogether. In rural Tyler County, West Virginia, for example, the average monthly premium will increase by $1,339 in 2026. In rural Pope County, Illinois, the average monthly premium will increase by $1,258.
More than 2.2 million rural Americans – and 13.8 million urban and suburban Americans – will see their health insurance premiums increase if the GOP wins negotiations during the government shutdown.
This data comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), which aggregates data at the state, county, and ZIP code levels. This dataset only includes the 31 states that use the federal Healthcare.gov health insurance marketplace to enroll consumers. The figures in this analysis are from the 2025 Open Enrollment Period (OEP), which ran from November 1, 2024, to January 15, 2025.
Originally, the health insurance subsidies were available to consumers with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL), roughly $32,000 to $128,000 for a family of four. But the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 expanded those subsidies to Americans living above 400% of the FPL, and the Inflation Reduction Act extended those subsidies until the end of 2025. Under the ACA, monthly premiums are capped based on income, with the federal government covering the remaining cost.
Compared to their urban counterparts, rural Americans are more likely to live in counties that will see the highest monthly health insurance premium spikes.
 


 
Nearly a quarter of rural Americans live in a county where the average premium increase will be between $659 and $1,339 per month. Only 2% of urban and suburban residents live in counties that will see this level of increase, meanwhile. On the other hand, 41% of metropolitan residents live in counties that will see the lowest increase in premiums – less than $509 per month. Only 18% of rural Americans live in counties in that category, however.
Rural West Virginia will see some of the highest premium spikes in the nation. All 35 of West Virginia’s nonmetropolitan, or rural, counties are in the fourth quartile of the highest premium spikes. In 33 of those 35 rural counties, the average premium increase will be more than $1,000 per month.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy, 15,000 West Virginians who have health insurance through the marketplace will lose health insurance altogether in 2026, if the current health insurance subsidies are not renewed.
Any increase in health insurance premiums is likely to result in loss of coverage for many Americans. One study found that, for every $40 increase in monthly premiums, there was a corresponding drop of one-fourth of the low-income enrollee population. Surveys find that cost is the main reason people don’t sign up for health insurance. According to the Congressional Budget Office, expiring subsidies will lead to 4.2 million enrollees losing health insurance by 2034. The end of these subsidies will hurt Americans across the board, regardless of whether they live in a rural or urban area.
Despite the partisan divide in Washington, funding for these subsidies has broad popular approval. A KFF Health News poll found that 78% of Americans believe that Congress should extend marketplace subsidies. In Florida, for example, conservatives have initiated a letter-writing campaign urging their legislators to extend health care subsidies.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota is using $1.5 million in Department of Health and Human Services general fund money to address food insecurity across the state exacerbated by the federal government shutdown.
The agency has granted $915,000 to the Great Plains Food Bank, which Gov. Kelly Armstrong said has gone to purchase more than 450,000 pounds of food that will start being distributed to an estimated 24,000 households.
The assistance comes as the government shutdown is expected to interrupt November benefits to those enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. About 57,000 North Dakotans received almost $10 million from SNAP in September.
Armstrong said the grant cannot make up for this funding, but is as much as the state can offer right now.
“It gets food to communities quickly to meet increased demand on food pantries until the federal government reopens and SNAP is restored,” Armstrong said at a Thursday press conference at the North Dakota Capitol in Bismarck.
North Dakota officials said last week the state is unable to fund SNAP directly because it cannot load money onto people’s electronic payment cards.
Armstrong said the Department of Health and Human Services gave $915,000 because it was the amount the nonprofit asked for.
The Great Plains Food Bank distributes food to almost 200 partner food pantries across the state.
“With distribution centers in Fargo and here in Bismarck, and a fleet of trucks that are on the road every day, we’re able to move food efficiently to our network operating in large cities, rural communities and our tribal nations,” said Great Plains Food Bank Interim CEO Kate Molbert.
The nonprofit sent out a plea for donations earlier this week due to the pause in federal services.
Armstrong on Thursday announced that the Department of Health and Human Services is also setting aside $600,000 to support the federal Women, Infants and Children Program, which helps feed low-income new mothers and young children.
The program was originally expected to run out of money Nov. 10. The additional money will keep it fully funded through November, said Interim Health and Human Services Commissioner Pat Traynor.
Local leaders rush to help, but can’t fill massive SNAP void

Families with young children who qualify for federal programs like SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Medicaid automatically qualify for the Women, Infants and Children Program, Traynor said.
There’s also a senior nutrition program for those age 60 or older, he added. There are no income requirements for that program.
For more information about food assistance, visit hhs.nd.gov or greatplainsfoodbank.org.
People can also call the Health and Human Services Department at 701-328-1000.
Armstrong said the state doesn’t know at this time whether the federal government will reimburse it for any of the money. 
He also said he’s not sure how the state will respond if the federal government is still shut down after November.
“We’re going to continue to hear where the needs are and see if there’s ways we can resource this,” he said. “But the answer is, we do not have unlimited funds in the state. We don’t have the infrastructure to replicate this stuff at the state level.”

(File photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)The builder of a 71-mile pipeline that will supply natural gas to a proposed power plant in South Carolina’s Lowcountry so far has 63 of the permission slips it needs from landowners to survey their property for the line’s potential route.
State-owned utility company Santee Cooper and Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy contracted Kinder Morgan to build, own and operate the $431 million pipeline that will stretch from Screven County in Georgia, across Hampton and northern Colleton County in South Carolina, to the site of a former coal plant along the Edisto River near Canadys.
On that site the two power companies plan to build a 220-megawatt power plant, now estimated to cost $5 billion — up from $2.5 billion when the two began considering the project three years ago. It’s unclear why the estimate has doubled. As of Thursday afternoon, Santee Cooper had not yet responded to the SC Daily Gazette’s questions about cost, initially asked Wednesday.
At the beginning of the month, Kinder Morgan sent out letters to 185 potentially impacted property owners across 220 tracts that lie along the proposed route in South Carolina, seeking permission to enter and survey their land. Since then, the company also has held group meetings with the landowners in each of the two counties.
In addition to the owners of 63 tracts who have already said yes, 10 have said no, said Allen Fore, Kinder Morgan, vice president of public affairs.
The company plans to spend the next six to eight months contacting and asking permission of the rest, he told the SC Daily Gazette.
I’ve received a letter. Now what?
It’s up to landowners whether or not to allow Kinder Morgan to come on to their property.
The company wants to survey a path 300 feet wide but ultimately will only need a 50-foot-wide path. They will pay the landowner for the right to bury the pipeline on the decided route. That means signed contracts might not be needed for all of the surveyed tracts.
Bridge-Project_v1
 
A large portion of the pipeline’s route also will run near existing power lines owned by Santee Cooper so as not to disturb more land and forest than necessary.
At this point in the process, it’s just about getting a look at the land. Surveyors won’t cut down any trees. They won’t dig up any ground. It’s not invasive, and the property owner can accompany the surveyors as they do their work, Fore said.
“We’re trying to find out if there’s anything out there that would be problematic for pipeline construction,” he said. “As you can imagine, we have 80,000 miles of pipe in 43 states and we have come across a lot of stuff, from dinosaur bones to pet cemeteries.”
Surveyors are looking for any environmental, ecological, archaeological, buildings or other existing structures, that may prove challenging to navigate or preclude the pipeline from coming through. They’re also there to hear what the landowner can tell them about the property.
On a project in Indiana, for example, Fore said a woman worried the pipeline would disturb the graves of her two beloved dogs. After learning this, Kinder Morgan moved the route by about 40 feet to the edge of her property.
What if I say no?
Kinder Morgan will follow its initial letter with phone calls and offers to meet in person with the pipeline executives.
Fore said he’s already made two of these visits in South Carolina to owners of two large tracts who had initially said “no” to the company.
After assuring one man he and his team weren’t bringing any survey equipment and had the authority to answer his questions, the group spent about 45 minutes walking around the property with the landowner.
The man, it turned out, was not opposed to the pipeline itself. But between the position of the man’s home, trees and ponds on the property, it became clear the land’s layout isn’t appropriate for pipeline construction.
“But it was important to get on the property and talk to the landowner, and it’s very likely we’re not going (to build) on that property at all,” Fore said.
As for the second landowner, when the team arrived, the man told them he thought he had a different way than what the company had originally planned.
“We got in his truck and drove around the property, and what we couldn’t see from our aerial review was a series of roads on the property that he had built,” Fore said. “He suggested we move off of neighboring properties onto his because it would be a better route for us.”
As a result, Kinder Morgan may now remove those other landowners from the potential route.
“That’s the level of detail,” Fore said.
Kinder Morgan doesn’t just send a letter and then immediately turn to the courts to get access or control over people’s property, he said: “Far from it. We don’t do that.”
Under South Carolina state law, Kinder Morgan does have the ability to get a court order to gain access for a survey, but Fore said the company considers that “counterproductive.”
What approvals are needed?
After completing the surveys, Kinder Morgan plans to pre-file its application, complete with detailed drawings of the final route. with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission between April and June of next year.
At that time, the company will begin conducting engineering and environmental reviews and holding the public hearings that it needs as it prepares to make full-blown filings with state and federal regulators.
In addition to permission from the commission, they’ll need various approvals from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, state Department of Archives and History, and the state Department of Environmental Services.
The federal regulatory process governs much of this project because the pipeline crosses state lines. But a massive piece of energy legislation, which Gov. Henry McMaster signed into law in May, did put time limits on any state-level permits.

Under the law, a state agency presented with an application for an “energy infrastructure project,” which includes natural gas pipelines, has six months to review it and make a decision. If the agency doesn’t meet this timeline, the application is considered approved.
“People just need to be more vigilant and understand the timeframe for public comment is shorter than it was before,” said Jeff Tibbals, a Charleston real estate lawyer who specializes in utility-related land cases.
The environmental permitting process is how people fully understand the project’s impact on land and water resources, said Emily Wyche, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The nonprofit is worried about the pipeline’s proximity to the 350,000-acre undeveloped estuary known as the ACE Basin.
Wyche contends the “more rushed process” for state permits will result in “less informed, thoughtful decision making on these permits that are ultimately going to impact people’s land and water.”
However, the entire route will also need federal approval, and the speed of state permits plays no role in the federal review and permitting process.
How much money will I receive?
When it begins to look as though state and federal regulators are ready to approve the route, that’s when Kinder Morgan will begin scheduling appraisals with impacted landowners about how much money the company is willing to offer, Fore said.
That process likely won’t start until late 2026.
SC utility, environmental groups reach deal on powerline upgrades through ancient cypress forest

Easements will give Kinder Morgan permanent access.
But landowners will still own and can use the land, with limitations. They can plant crops or bushes, but not large trees with deep roots, and they can’t build any kind of structure on it in case the company has to come back and dig up the pipe for maintenance.
Whatever the company pays for right of way will be a one-time payment that won’t transfer if the landowner sells. And having the easement there can impact the value of the property in a sale.
How much the company will offer is unknown. Amounts will depend on the land’s value and negotiations.
Tibbals, who has helped negotiate several high-profile deals for clients, said the appraisal must take into account the value of the land included in the easement as well as how the presence of the pipeline impacts the value of landowners’ remaining property.
He said it’s that second category he most often sees neglected in the initial offers from utility companies.
The pipeline’s proposed route goes through a dozen private properties protected by conservation easements — which keep out multi-home and commercial builders — according to a map provided by the Southern Environmental Law Center. That nonprofit, as well as the Conservation Voters of South Carolina, worry about the pipeline crossing what’s supposed to be forever protected.
Tibbals said such easements don’t stop pipeline construction, but the nonprofits that manage them must be part of the negotiating process. Because those easements protect the land from being subdivided and developed, it also means the land might be worth less and result in a lower offer from the pipeline company.
While land values have increased as South Carolina’s population has grown, appraisers also consider agricultural land lower in worth than property zoned for possible residential, commercial or industrial development, Tibbals said.
Once a company completes the appraisal and submits an offer to a landowner, that can start the clock on what Tibbals called a 30-day negotiating period.

Can I be forced to sign a deal?
Yes, South Carolina state law allows the builders of natural gas pipelines, as well as private water companies and corporate electric companies, to use what is known as condemnation to force a landowner to sign over access rights.
If a deal isn’t reached during the negotiating period, Tibbals said, a pipeline company can file a lawsuit. Once a company files that condemnation suit, landowners have 30 days to decide whether to challenge the company in court.
But, Tibbals said, if a project has government approvals, landowners usually don’t have a good claim for stopping it crossing their land.  If the property owner doesn’t challenge the project within those 30 days, the company can start construction.
“The only issue then is how much they get paid,” Tibbals said.
There is no time limit for filing a legal challenge to the amount the company offers, Tibbals said, as long as the landowner has not accepted payment.
Still, all of this is why Fore said Kinder Morgan wants to have conversations with landowners now, in an effort to avoid tracts owned by people vehemently opposed.
“Anytime you build, you want a mutually agreeable resolution to whatever it is,” he said. “The folks who genuinely, adamantly — there’s no configuration, no compensation, no construction modification, no route adjustment that can accommodate those folks — that’s not a good way to start a relationship.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gas-pipeline.jpg,,,2025-10-30 15:57:09.536853

Democratic Gov. Jared Polis announced his request for the money last week. The funding, set in $3.3 million increments over six weeks from the state’s General Fund, will go to the food bank network Feeding Colorado through the Community Food Assistance Grant Program.
The Joint Budget Committee unanimously approved the request on Thursday morning.
“I’m certain that this is a hope shared by this committee, that the federal government will resolve and become the partner to us that it should be, and fund the programs that it is legally required to fund,” said Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat.

The approximately 600,000 low-income Coloradans who typically receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program money from the federal government will not get those benefits in November as the government shutdown persists. People use SNAP benefits to supplement their grocery budgets, and advocates predict that a pause in funding will push hungry people towards food banks for help. The average Colorado household that uses SNAP receives $367 per month, adding up to about $120 million in the state each month.
“It is a sandbag in a flood,” Tom Dermody, a policy analyst with the JBC, told lawmakers. “We don’t have the mechanism to actually step in and provide that (full) funding. We’re also in a budgetary circumstance where we don’t have the scale to actually address the SNAP emergency in any sort of truly meaningful way.”
The money from the state is intended to help Feeding Colorado purchase enough food to meet some of the needs, focusing on communities with high shares of SNAP recipients. Food banks have already started preparing for an influx of visitors starting this weekend.
Attorney General Phil Weiser joined a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the SNAP issue, arguing that federal contingency funds can be used to pay the roughly $8 billion for November benefits across the country.
Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican, questioned why Polis hadn’t declared an emergency on the issue, enabling him to use the state’s emergency disaster fund.
“It’s about the poor planning that’s taking place in this state. This is an emergency disaster and I don’t know why we wouldn’t declare that,” she said. “They could have put a process in place two weeks ago to try to identify how to work through this and make sure that people weren’t going without food.”
Democrats on the committee pushed back on that idea, saying it is risky to use emergency funds when there is a chance of other disasters affecting the state, such as floods, wildfires and other impacts from the federal shutdown.

(Provided by the shelter and Facebook)The Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter has been remediated following a state plan to deal with a drug incineration gone awry, but shelter staff aren’t working out of the facility and the long-term location of the facility is in flux.
On Oct. 24, the City of Billings issued a press release saying remediation had been completed following a Department of Environmental Quality-approved plan. That work plan also collects information like certifications and property details and identifies site considerations such as floor plans, ventilation, attics and crawl spaces, the DEQ said in a statement. The agency’s authority is specific to the air quality permit and incineration equipment and DEQ’s Air Quality Bureau is still investigating the incident, an agency spokesperson wrote in an email.
They’re waiting on a final clearance plan as well, she added.
“The final clearance plan will include instructions for collecting samples that will document that clean-up has met the decontamination standard,” agency spokesperson Madison McGeffers wrote in an email.
The shelter has not operated out of the building at 1735 Monad Road in Billings since the incident, a Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter spokesperson told the Daily Montanan.
Instead, they’ve been operating out of a warehouse and their other location on Grand Avenue.
To date, Billings has reimbursed the shelter $51,191.25 for initial cleaning by Newman Restoration and initial testing performed by Northern Industrial Hygiene, a city press release said. Additionally, the city paid a certified methamphetamine cleanup company $6,621 to clean the Animal Control Incinerator Room.
The city, though, said some beans remain uncounted.
“YVAS directly contracted Newman Restoration for cleaning of YVAS’s personal property but has not provided the City with a total cost estimate or scope of work related to this cleaning despite multiple requests,” a city press release stated.
The shelter said timing was the biggest factor.
“We needed items cleaned quickly so that we could get our temporary location set up. An itemized contents estimate would have taken a good amount of time when we needed items cleaned quickly and returned,” shelter spokesperson Izzy Zalenski said.. “One of our biggest concerns was getting out veterinary equipment out as soon as possible, not only did we have a Spay/Neuter clinic coming up that weekend, but we also have medical cases come in almost daily, so we needed to be able to serve those animals.”
There is also a question about smoke damage in the HVAC system at the facility. Northern Industrial Hygiene’s cleanup recommended, “cleaning of the entire structure and HVAC system for potential smoke damage,” the city press release said, but that “NIH acknowledged to the City that this recommendation was based largely on statements made by YVAS personnel, and not on testing or direct observation.”
The release said Billings is obtaining independent estimates for more testing to see if there’s smoke damage and “whether any additional cleaning is necessary before committing further taxpayer resources.”
The DEQ said it’s hard to tell the level of contamination.
“It is difficult to quantify or compare the severity of exposure from individual-to-individual,” McGeffers wrote in an email. “Since methamphetamine is a powerful, highly addictive stimulant that affects the central nervous system and can be inhaled or absorbed through direct skin contact, all contaminated properties are a concern for human health and must be mitigated with care.”
She added, “Our test results are specific to surface residue. There were surface residue test results that were above the health-based standard.”
Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter does not plan to return to the Monad Road location, the organization said in a statement last week. The Billings press release said that if the shelter does return to the location, they’d “commit to discontinuing the use of the incinerator for drug disposal.”
The city is also waiting to hear back from the state’s Attorney General’s Office on the agreement that allowed drugs to be burnt in the first place.
“The City is awaiting feedback from the Montana Attorney General’s Office regarding updates to the MOU previously used for drug disposal by law enforcement agencies statewide,” the city press release said.
It’s unclear how long drugs have been incinerated at the facility.
“I don’t have an actual date,” city administrator Chris Kukulski wrote in an email. “The facility was built in the early 2000s. We are aware that it was being used to incinerate drugs since at least 2007.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shelter-pup.jpg,,,2025-10-30 15:57:09.536853

(Photo: Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department)The executive director of a Las Vegas animal rescue organization that raised money to treat Reba, the bulldog who died after being abandoned in a plastic tote, has used proceeds from the nonprofit organization to pay herself an unapproved salary and for personal expenses, such as  streaming service subscriptions and vacation expenses, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday, 
The lawsuit comes as rescues in Southern Nevada pick up the slack for government shelters, which are overcrowded and historically underfunded.  Advocates fear the allegations in the lawsuit could raise concerns about the integrity of non-profit rescues as they seek public money to help cover their costs. 
The suit, filed by the board of directors of Vegas Pet Rescue Project, alleges Jamie Gregory, the organization’s founder, president, as well as executive director, altered the organization’s bylaws after she and board members received an anonymous email alleging misuse of funds by Gregory. 
“While the organization has no doubt played a role in supporting animals and serving the community, such positive contributions do not exempt it from legal obligations,” says the anonymous email, which was provided to the Current. 
Bylaws provided by Gregory to the Current and sent to board members for authentication, differed from those provided to the board by Gregory. In text messages included in the lawsuit, Gregory admits to board colleagues that she altered the bylaws to guard against losing her unapproved salary or being terminated by the board.  
“I did edit things concerning voting the director out of position,” Gregory wrote in the text, adding she felt “pushback” from the board “regarding my position and the fact that I have a salary and that it wasn’t voted on. … The idea of not being involved in the rescue I founded terrifies me.” 
On Wednesday, Gregory said that she will be “responding through legal counsel and vehemently deny the claims.” She declined to say more. 
Last month, Gregory told the Current she earns $74,000 a year in salary. Bylaws she provided indicate the executive director is to earn $20 an hour for 30 hours a week, which would total $31,200 annually. 
VPRP’s tax returns from 2018 through 2023, the last year on file, report no income for Gregory. 
The lawsuit alleges in 2024 Gregory paid herself $86,896 in compensation, and just under $69,000 through September of this year, and used rescue funds to pay $5,444 in personal expenses this year, and $5,337 last year. 
“These personal expenses included: personal cell phone, subscriptions to Amazon
Prime Video, Amazon Music, and Amazon Digital, Defendant’s Ring doorbell subscription, food for Defendant’s personal pets, personal trips (car rental and gas), as well as charges for food and gas while Defendant was on vacation at Disney World in Orlando, Florida,” the lawsuit says. 
The rescue operated at a loss of $61,418 in 2022 and $61,463 in 2023, according to tax returns. 
‘A difficult decision’
“It’s important to emphasize the reason why rescues are created: to help animals. They are not meant to become personal piggy banks,” Annoula Wylderich, founder and director of Animal Protection Affiliates, said via email,  “Those who view their rescue as a means for personal gain are not in it for the right reasons and shouldn’t be.”
The rescue’s “mission has been compromised by the Defendant, who is currently holding hostage the organization and exposing it to the loss of its tax exempt and nonprofit status,” the lawsuit says, adding the board of directors “were forced to make a very difficult decision and authorize this action to preserve and safeguard VPRP.”
In a statement Thursday, the board, all of whom are volunteers, said it “acted swiftly and responsibly to address the situation in order to protect the animals. Moving forward, we are dedicated to ensuring that 100% of all funds are directed toward the care of the animals, just as it was always intended.” 
“Rescues that do not operate with transparency and accountability are not only placing their own organization and officers at risk (legally and otherwise), they are betraying the animals and donors and hurting those charities that DO operate ethically,” said Wylderich, who credited the VPRP board for their efforts. “They set a great example of what a good, trustworthy nonprofit board looks like.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rebafrommetro-1024x567.png,,,2025-10-30 15:57:09.536853

Tea Republican Sen. Ernie Otten said the committee was “being slighted” by Johnson’s failure to appear, adding that lawmakers need to hear “the other side” of allegations against Johnson’s office.
Members of the South Dakota Canvassing Group, which advocates for removing tabulation machines from elections and replacing them with hand counting, allege that the Secretary of State’s Office allowed an election systems vendor to provide uncertified laptops to some counties for election use, and used some funds inappropriately to update the state’s voter registration and election night reporting system. The group is also concerned about a vendor connected to a multi-state voter registration system that has come under scrutiny for privacy and security concerns.
Some of those concerns were raised by members of South Dakota Canvassing at the committee’s May meeting, but lawmakers chose to have Johnson return at a later meeting to answer questions posed to her.

(Photo: Melissa Sue Gerrits / Carolina Public Press)In 2014, the North Carolina General Assembly commissioned a report that came to a stark conclusion: the state should discontinue the use of its economic distress tiers. The tiers fail to accurately capture economic distress, the report said. The system isn’t working for struggling communities.
A decade later, the system has only become more entrenched, influencing an unknown number of state programs, both economic and not.
North Carolina is the only state in the country with a three-tiered economic distress ranking — and certainly the only one where such ranking bears this amount of influence. Could there be a better way to distribute state funding and lift up the state’s most disadvantaged communities?
“There have been many attempts to tinker with the system,” N.C. Rural Center CEO Patrick Woodie told Carolina Public Press.
“It has remained basically intact, mainly because we haven’t found a viable alternative. There’s a lot of lawmakers that would like to see improvement, but can’t find a consensus or a path forward.”
In 2024, a bipartisan bill that would have directed the N.C. Collaboratory at UNC-Chapel Hill to study potential changes to the economic distress tier system on behalf of the legislature did not become law.
This year, the N.C. Department of Commerce conducted listening sessions in cities across the state to hear residents’ concerns and ideas about the state’s economic development strategy.

The conclusions drawn from those conversations will help inform the Comprehensive Strategic Economic Development Plan for 2026 through 2030. Whether that plan will attempt to address the shortcomings of the tier system remains to be seen.
This is the third article in Trapped By Tiers, a three-part Carolina Public Press investigative series examining North Carolina’s economic distress tiers, a system intended to promote economic mobility across the state. CPP analyzed state data and found that this system is ineffective, stagnant, and at times, counterproductive.
The first article examined the ways in which this system fails counties across the economic spectrum. The second focused on where North Carolina went wrong. This third and final installment explores ways to improve the system, as well as possible alternatives.
Speaking up about pockets of economic distress
Karen Howard of Chatham County has a plan.
As a commissioner, she has seen how the county’s persistent Tier 3 status has left less fortunate parts of her county in the dust — towns like Siler City and Goldston. Because they are located in Chatham County, those communities do not get the special treatment that struggling communities in Tier 1 and 2 counties do. The situation in economically distressed communities within counties are concealed within an overall countywide picture of economic success.

“There needs to be more vision in the planning for how these tiers affect communities,” Howard said. “Not just counties, but communities. We could come up with workable solutions that allow for some nuance and for the possibility of a wealthy town very close to a poor town.”
Even in her frustration, Howard sees a path forward.
“Counties that have this challenge have the opportunity to form some sort of coalition,” she said.
“We need to work on the solution and present it to our legislators as a nonpartisan or bipartisan endeavor to address the very real challenge. Counties across the state span these deep pockets of wealth and then deep pockets of poverty. We could come up with and collaboratively design a workable solution that could be presented to the state.
“We can’t just show up and say you need to do better. There really needs to be some sort of a broad collaborative effort to draft this solution and present it to our legislators as a cohort, and I think we have a much better chance of success.”
The legislature
For Rep. Dante Pittman, D-Wilson, Nash, protecting disadvantaged counties like those he represents is of the utmost priority. Wilson and Nash are both persistent Tier 1 of economic distress counties. Pittman appreciates the way that the system recognizes and singles out the struggles of his constituents. If the system were to change, he wouldn’t want that special spotlight to shift.
“My primary focus is making sure that any changes to this system protect rural counties that don’t have the same level of resources,” Rep. Pittman told CPP.
Past changes to the system have been colored by specific legislators’ motivations, rather than a genuine attempt to improve the system for all counties, said Rep. Brian Turner, D-Buncombe. Rep. Turner believes the economic distress tiers system is outdated, overly applied, and fails to serve its original purpose.
“The system is overly simplistic, and just really needs to be updated and more sophisticated,” he said. “It needs to be done independent of manipulation and influence of the legislature. We need a revised system, and we need a consultancy to help us create one. Because I don’t think that the expertise exists within the legislature to do this without people putting their thumbs on the scale.”

Meanwhile, some legislators don’t even know about the system.
Rep. Garland Pierce, a Democrat who serves Hoke and Scotland counties, is one of these legislators. Both of his counties are persistent Tier 1 counties, but he told CPP that he did not know there was any system in place to benefit them. 
What do other states do?
One place to start that work is looking at what other states do.
Georgia’s system of four economic tiers builds in flexibility and allows for sub-county targeting. If a county experiences sudden economic distress — say from a hurricane or a factory closure — state officials can choose to move that county into a different tier, opening it up to enhanced state assistance. In addition, special zones like Less Developed Census Tracts and Georgia Opportunity Zones allow for pockets of poverty in otherwise affluent regions to get recognition.
Plus, Georgia’s tiers are used for just one thing: a job creation tax credit program.
Rep. Turner thinks state programs other than economic development should have to apply to use the tier system in their decision making programs, rather than just implementing it with impunity.
In Tennessee, counties are ranked in a system of five tiers that measures economic performance against a national standard.
This is closer to what Carolyn Fryberger, co-author of the UNC School of Government study on distress tiers, thinks could work.
“Let’s find a real benchmark of well-being and then measure ourselves against that,” she said.
Getting rid of the pre-set numbers of counties in each economic distress category would be a major improvement to the system, said Josh Carpenter, director of economic development group Mountain West Partnership. There isn’t always going to be exactly 40 distressed counties, 40 medium counties and 20 non-distressed counties, he pointed out.

At the national level, Federal Opportunity Zones use census tracts rather than county lines. This allows for a more granular look at geographic disparities. Both Maryland and Virginia identify specific Enterprise Zones that target specific areas within and across counties borders.
Many in North Carolina think this kind of specificity would help the system.
“We have proposed that tier designations should be assigned based on zip code, which is more reflective of the specific area,” Iredell County manager Beth Milton told CPP.
“Unfortunately, we have received little support from our legislature to make this modification.”
North Carolina’s county-by-county economic distress system catches a lot of flack for being too broad. But in some cases, the county-level is actually too narrow. The regional clustering of persistent Tier 1 counties in Eastern North Carolina, for example, is not addressed by the system.
Colorado’s Enterprise Zones, in contrast, span multi-county regions, allowing for regional cooperation.
“Regions are so much stronger when they work together,” Fryberger said. “The tiers just further cement county-to-county competition and ranking.”
Finding solutions to economic distress
Some agree with the 2014 report from the legislature: the tier system should just be thrown out.
“I will say that being designated Tier 3 prohibits us from receiving many benefits, especially related to capital project funding for new and renovated buildings as well as lottery funds,” Henderson County Commissioner Rebecca McCall told CPP.
“It is my stance that the tier system should be eliminated and funding provided where most needed.”
One idea is that there should be special programming for the bottom 20 counties, or that more tiers should be introduced back into the system. There aren’t 40 counties suffering from the highest level of economic distress, according to Woodie of the N.C. Rural Center — it’s more like 20 or 25. Grouping those bottom 20 in with counties the top half of Tier 1 does them a disservice, he said.
In the eyes of Rep. Lindsey Prather, D-Buncombe, the problems with the system are simple and fixable.
“First, there’s no reason to have a required number of counties in a certain category,” she said. “Second, we should consider whether more factors should be measured beyond the current four. Third, we should consider whether counties are the best district to measure, or if a smaller area — like zip codes — would better reflect the communities.”

The stakes are high. Struggling counties are not improving under the current economic distress system. Wealthy counties can’t access state assistance for their own disadvantaged communities. Counties that improve economically get punished with reduced funding.
A decade ago, the legislature recommended killing the system. Instead, the distress tiers have found even broader applications.
Changing the state’s system of economic development is possible. The question is whether North Carolina’s legislators and policy makers have the political will to make it happen and can set aside their differences long enough to work toward an effective solution.

(Screenshot)U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced Thursday that a road-focused immigration sweep with Indiana State Police has resulted in the arrests of 223 people alleged to be living in the Chicago area and beyond without legal status.
“Operation Midway Blitz” was launched in September and dedicated to an Illinois woman killed in a vehicle crash with a Guatemalan man in January.
“If you are here, driving on our streets illegally, and our highways, you are endangering our citizens, and your days are numbered,” Noem declared at a news conference in Gary, Indiana.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun and Hoosier Public Safety Secretary Anthony Scott were also present.
Noem said 223 immigrants were arrested “and taken off our roads” through a 287(g) agreement with Indiana State Police. The deal was inked over the summer.

Of those, 146 were drivers: 46 semi-truck drivers and another 82 who drove box trucks, buses and other vehicles. They held commercial driver’s licenses from more than a dozen states, according to Noem. 
She pointed to large pictures of non-citizens convicted of various crimes, noting that collaborations with state and local law enforcement agencies have yielded more than 3,000 arrests since the “Midway Blitz” began.
Noem said that number includes “rapists, murderers and gang members.”
“We don’t want any of these individuals … in our communities, and we especially don’t want them behind the wheel of an 18-wheeler when they can’t speak our language, they don’t understand our laws, they can’t follow our roadway signs, and they can’t interact with law enforcement or our citizens,” she continued.
Braun thanked the Trump administration for “looking to Indiana,” saying illegal driving impacts the interstate highway-heavy Hoosier State more than others.
Indiana State Police plan to expand their cooperation with ICE, according to Braun, by assigning more troopers to commercial vehicle enforcement across the state.

Scott, who is also the state police commissioner, emphasized the work is “not new,” adding that it’s “what we do every day.”
About 1.5 million commercial vehicles are weighed or inspected annually in Indiana, per Scott.
“For the Indiana State Police, this is not about immigration status alone,” he said. “It’s about public safety. An 80,000-pound truck in untrained hands is a dangerous thing.”
Indiana will be reimbursed for its work, according to ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan, who cited provisions in the recently approved One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
“I’d like to thank you for defending the homeland, for choosing put the American people first, and the state of Indiana first,” Sheahan told Braun and Scott.

Beshear said in his weekly press conference that boxes will be stationed in the lobbies of major state office buildings in Frankfort and the L&N Building in Louisville between Oct. 30 and Nov. 21 to collect non-perishable food for those in need. The governor added that the donated items will go to established charities like Dare to Care, God’s Pantry and Christian Appalachian Project to distribute to Kentuckians. 
“We’re going to be really intentional about making sure that these donations reach needy families across the state,” Beshear said. “I’m really proud to work alongside so many incredible Team Kentucky members that care so much about our state and the families that make up our state — something Team Kentucky has always made a priority. I know every donation will make a difference, and I appreciate everyone who takes part in this or any other food drive.” 
Democrats and Republicans have been going back and forth this week at the federal level as 42 million Americans are at risk of losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits starting Saturday. Yet, no agreement had been reached as of Thursday. 
Beshear joined a lawsuit on Tuesday with more than two dozen Democratic state officials suing the Trump administration for halting SNAP assistance despite during the government shutdown. The governor said that a hearing was scheduled in the lawsuit Thursday. 
On Thursday, Beshear renewed his criticism of the president for not finding a solution to the looming stoppage in food assistance. Beshear said that his “faith teaches me that food is life-giving and it is meant to be shared,” and noted that food assistance has continued during previous government shutdowns. 
“Let me be clear. The Trump administration can fund SNAP. They can make that decision,” Beshear said. “It has been done in past shutdowns, and the money is there. Moreover, if this president thinks he can do a $40 billion bailout of Argentina during a government shutdown, certainly he can fund SNAP for a lot less.”
Trump has been seeking $40 million in financing to Argentina this month to bolster the nation’s collapsing currency. 
A USDA memo published by NPR earlier this week said that “there is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed” and that “SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits.”
The expected stoppage in federal food assistance leaves states to find solutions in the meantime. Republican West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced the state would contribute “up to $13 million” to two West Virginia food banks as it matches donations from residents there. Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency last week to allow using state funds to “provide food benefits.” Virginia has since rolled out a substitute state program, Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance, to send money to SNAP beneficiaries. 
Beshear told reporters “a number of options are on the table” for Kentucky at the moment, but he was not sure a special session of the state legislature would be necessary to address food assistance. He also said that any state solution would not make up for the full loss of the federal funding. 
The monthly cost of SNAP in Kentucky is about $100 million, Beshear said, providing assistance to almost 600,000 Kentuckians. Kentucky has $3.7 billion in its budget reserve trust fund, also known as the “rainy day fund.”
“All Donald Trump has to do is say, ‘I don’t want people to go hungry,’ authorize the SNAP payments to go out and our people will be OK,” Beshear said. “Either he will make the choice for folks to get full benefits, or it will be his decision that causes significant hunger.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1809-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 15:01:23.934852

This story was originally reported by Jennifer Gerson of The 19th.  Meet Jennifer and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
With 42 million Americans on the brink of losing their SNAP benefits on November 1, many nonprofits and online content creators are asking parents to rethink what they hand out to trick-or-treaters this Halloween.
Some groups and influencers are using their platforms to remind followers that funding for SNAP — short for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and often referred to as “food stamps” — is about to run out because of the government shutdown. Handing out nonperishable food alongside candy, they say, can go a long way to help neighbors in need.
In a viral Facebook post, the United Way Family Resource Center recommended adding things like ramen, microwave macaroni-and-cheese cups, shelf-stable pudding, bags of pretzels and protein bars to the sweet treats in every child’s Halloween basket. “Every little bit helps keep a child’s belly full — and shows that kindness can be just as sweet as candy,” the post says.
Many popular pediatrician influencers and other content creators who focus on child well-being are repeating a similar message. Among their suggestions is placing a supply of Cup Noodles and mini cereal boxes on the doorstep so families can take what they need without stigma.
Heather Black is the vice president of 211 System Strategy at the United Way. 211 is the three-digit dialing code designated at the federal level to connect people to health and human services in their community — and Black said there has been “very significant increases in calls related specifically to food” to 211 since the government shutdown began four weeks ago. 211 has call centers across the country, reaching virtually all of the United States. Callers are connected with a trained responder who, after completing a short intake, connects them with local resources.
Black told The 19th that housing, utility assistance and food have always encompassed the top needs of 211 callers. Now, she said, “we are starting to see food needs specifically increase from people who maybe have always been able to rely on SNAP benefits and with the increasing publicity that funding from those benefits will not be available for the month of November, there’s beginning to be a lot of anxiety among families around how they’re going to meet those costs.”
Another group of callers concerned about food insecurity right now, Black said, are federal workers who do not receive SNAP benefits, but who are approaching four weeks without a paycheck while also dealing with increasingly high grocery store prices.
“This is real life for people,” Black said. That’s where the spirit of the now-viral Halloween posts come into play — and speak of ways to extend that energy even further.
“I think that’s a really creative idea, the Halloween idea — but that’s just one brief moment in time,” she said. “We’re going to need to do a lot more.”
In addition to encouraging people to support local food pantries and other community groups that help provide groceries to those in need, Black said there are other ways people can help.
“We need to check on our neighbors,” she said, mentioning people with children and older adults in particular. “We need to check in and make sure that people that we might know who would in a situation where their income could either be impacted by the government shutdown where they are now not getting a paycheck or if they have relied in the past on some of these programs where funding has now been paused — we need to check in on those folks.”
Black reminded that giving can also go beyond just donating to local food pantries. She recommended that when checking on people whose access to food might have been impacted by the shutdown in some way, ask if they need any items from the grocery store.
“I really encourage people to think in that way because asking for help is not always easy,” she said.

Farm groups said the trade deal was “encouraging” but also noted the need to continue looking for export markets and developing domestic soybean markets. 
Trump and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced Thursday China would purchase at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans this year, followed by at least 25 million metric tons annually in 2026, 2027 and 2028.

The announcement followed Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, where the leaders agreed to remove certain retaliatory tariffs and Xi agreed to continue exports of rare-earth materials and possibly purchase energy from the U.S. 
Aside from a small reported shipment of soybeans purchased just ahead of the leaders’ talk, China had not purchased any soybeans from the current U.S. crop, which left farmers wondering if they had lost their largest export market. 
Iowa Soybean Association called the announcement “encouraging news” in a news release Thursday. ISA said soybean associations were “encouraged” that the trade commitments were framed as minimums and looked forward to “continued growth in soybean purchases beyond these levels.” 
ISA President Tom Adam said the announcement addressed many of the concerns farmers had after “months of stalled purchases and uncertainty.” 
“This is great news for American agriculture and for soybean farmers who have been eager to reestablish a stable and long-term relationship that positions us for success moving forward,” Adam said in the release. “We are very grateful to President Trump for making soybeans a priority in negotiations with China.”
According to the association, China has historically purchased between 28 and 36 million metric tons of soybeans, annually over the last 10 years, excluding the past two years when the country bought fewer U.S. beans. 
The association also called for the administration to continue developing other foreign export relationships and to finalize renewable fuel standards to help grow the domestic soybean market.

What’s that in bushels?
According to Iowa Soybean Association the 12 million metric tons China is poised to buy this year equates to 441 million bushels. 
The 25 million metric tons it has agreed to purchase annually through 2028 equates to 918.5 million bushels. 

Rollins said in a social media post the deal was “HUGE” considering China has played “hard ball” with the U.S. over the past four years. 
“China’s additional commitment to purchase minimums for the next three years while President Trump is in the White House to actually hold them accountable is good for all of us!” Rollins wrote. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the deal with China will make a “meaningful impact” on farmers who are “feeling the pain of a tough farm economy.”
“It’s important that we continue to play offense on trade by opening and expanding new markets while also driving domestic use of Iowa products, especially homegrown biofuels,” Naig said in a statement. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst also celebrated the news Thursday on their social media accounts. 
Iowa Farm Bureau Federation President Brent Johnson similarly said the deal was a positive development for farmers. 
“The announcement of China’s return to the marketplace is welcomed news and should provide some price support to struggling U.S. soybean markets,” Johnson said in a statement. “With farmers facing rising costs to grow a crop amid depressed markets, we applaud the administration’s efforts to secure trade deals and opportunities for agriculture.”

The federal government is shut down. Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their health care coverage or facing skyrocketing premium increases, and millions more won’t be receiving the food assistance they need to feed their families come November 1.
Americans are right to be spooked, and the fear is very likely to persist beyond Halloween.
Even when Congress finally ends the government shutdown and addresses the growing crisis in food security and health care, the horrors inflicted on Medicaid, Medicare and SNAP in this summer’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will remain.  When coupled with drastic cuts to public health programs through the DOGE program, and more recent cuts in response to the shutdown, the future of our health, security and well-being looks grim.
At the age of 55, I know a few things about life-saving health care. I have survived cancer treatments, strokes, a brain aneurysm and end-stage kidney disease that requires dialysis. I also take several medications that are lifesaving.
Without access to affordable health coverage and prescriptions, I would have been long gone. Even with coverage, I had to fight to ensure payment for needed treatments, but I have been one of the lucky ones who had coverage and the ability to fight to guarantee it.
I’m also a mother whose two daughters have depended on Medicaid during periods where they couldn’t get health care through their employers. In that way, they are like the more than 3 million North Carolinians covered by Medicaid insurance–more than 1 in 4 persons.
The U.S. spends more on health care alone than the entire gross domestic product of every nation in the world other than China. In spite of spending nearly twice as much per person as any other nation, our health outcomes rank low among developed nations. People will disagree about what’s wrong with the system and how to fix it, but there is no denying that we spend a lot more than we get in return.
Those of us who believe that quality, affordable health care should be available to everyone have our own solutions in mind, but policy change is hard in today’s polarized political context and given the complexity of the system. Still, as more and more Americans and businesses contend with escalating health care costs and impossible choices, demand will grow for serious solutions that don’t just put a bandaid on cost, but leverage government power to stop escalating prices.
Make no mistake, it will be up to us regular Americans to force that change. It’s clear in this moment our elected officials in Washington can’t even agree on keeping health care costs in line, getting food to the hungry, and reopening the government that they all work for. Rather than legislating for the good of their constituents, they are stubbornly playing political games to stick it to the other party. This is not what the American people want, or what we voted for—no matter which candidate we chose.
I have stood with others in front of the offices of U.S. Representatives Hudson and Rouzer in Fayetteville, demanding action to protect our health care and SNAP. Despite many requests for meetings, they have ignored constituents—even though they have been in the district for over a month now and while they continue to collect a paycheck to act as our representatives.
I’m an educator and an organizer, not an expert in healthcare policy. But I do know that the voters and communities I work with want affordable health care that meets their needs, lower prescription drug prices, nutrition programs that prevent hunger and malnourishment, and a public health system that defends us against diseases and prevents health crises like Covid.
This may be a lot to ask of a government that can’t even stay open–but it shouldn’t be. If other nations can provide health care at lower cost and with better outcomes, why can’t we move forward in that direction rather than constantly backtracking on hard-won progress?
I’d love to ask Representatives Rouzer and Hudson that question directly, but they won’t meet with me or anyone who is impacted by the shutdown they voted for. I’d also like to remind them that as supporters of “work requirements” in Medicaid and SNAP, they too should get to work and start representing their constituents instead of prioritizing political games.

A state district court judge has rejected a plea deal that could have seen a former Colstrip High School teacher accused of multiple felonies for having repeated sexual contact with a 15-year-old student avoid prison time altogether.
Last month, Rosebud County District Court Judge Rennie Wittman told William Eugene Schuman-Kline that she was going to reject the plea agreement that would have sentenced him to 20 years in state prison, suspended 16 of them, and then had the option of serving no jail time.
Attorneys for the former high school teacher had argued that prison time wouldn’t benefit anyone, and mounted a letter-writing campaign from community members, teachers, university professors and even religious leaders who asked the court for leniency.
Meanwhile, advocates for Indigenous People urged the court to reject the plea agreement, saying that there’s been a longstanding and systemic practice of courts doling out light punishments, especially when the victims are youth and Native American.
Wittman explained to Schuman-Kline, the court would not agree with the plea deal and instead sentence him on two different counts of sexual assault, one that carried a 20-year sentence, with 10 suspended; and another that carries a 10-year sentence, with no time suspended. Both of the counts would have run concurrently, meaning that Schuman-Kline would have spent at least 10 years in custody of the Montana Department of Corrections before being released.
Wittman allowed Schuman-Kline to withdraw from the plea agreement, which he did, and opted instead to have the case head for a trial, scheduled for Jan. 5-9, 2026.
A letter from Colstrip High School Principal Robin Nansel, who first reported the crime after students from a sports team informed her about it, urged Wittman to use the moment to demonstrate to the community that it will not tolerate the behavior and will protect students.
“The damage does not end with (the victim). His betrayal did not only devastate this student personally; it sent shockwaves through her peers, her friends and the staff members who worked alongside the defendant,” Nansel wrote in a letter to the judge. “A strong and just sentence is necessary — not only to hold him accountable, but to affirm to all students and families that we will protect them and such a betrayal will never be tolerated.”
Advocates for victims of sexual assault and indigenous women strongly objected to the terms of the plea deal, despite nearly two dozen letters of support for Schuman-Kline, whose family, former professors and even religious counselors said deserved leniency for his actions after being charged. Warrior Women For Justice said it worried that the case would become just another in a long list of offenses against Native people which receive a lighter sentence.
“Historically, courts have struggled with holding accountability to non-Natives that commit heinous crimes within Indigenous communities, and within our own communities,” the letter from Nicci Wagy, the executive director of the group wrote to Wittman.
Lucy Simpson, the executive Director of the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center, stated it more bluntly.
“The NIWRC support the court’s imposition of the maximum sentence under law, as well as permanently barring Mr. Schuman-Kline from teaching, coaching or working with children in any capacity,” it said.
Schuman-Kline declined comment or interview for this story as did his counsel, Mark Parker.
  The charges 

The Rosebud County Attorney’s Office charged Schuman-Kline in January with five counts, four of them felonies including sexual assault and sexual abuse of a child.
According to court documents, Schuman-Kline was a first-year teacher at Colstrip and around 27 years old at the time when he is alleged to have begun flirting with a 15-year-old student. The inappropriate and illegal behavior described in court documents spanned a period from October through December 2023.
Those documents state that Schuman-Kline used his power as a teacher to coerce her into sexual activity that she could not consent to as a minor, and also because he was in a position of authority as a teacher.
Students at the high school as well as athletic coaches noticed what they considered to be suspicious behavior. The victim and Schuman-Kline had communicated often during the two-month span with the app Snapchat. The court documents said that Schuman-Kline also gave alcohol to the victim both on school grounds and a recreation building.
The court documents also allege that he would help the student with her homework after class and without anyone else present. The victim later told investigators that Schuman-Kline gave her credit for work she did not complete. The court documents also describe times when Schuman-Kline would “make out” with the victim, and details several instances where they engaged in sexual contact.
Authorities also say that Schuman-Kline and the victim used the Snapchat application to send explicit photos to each other, which the application would quickly delete. Court documents said that through forensic recovery of the phone, investigators said that Schuman-Kline had sent nude photographs of himself, while the victim sent several photos of herself topless.
Schuman-Kline also encouraged the victim to use the Snapchat app because it was “sneakier” than other applications, and even though his wife had checked his phone, she had found nothing, court documents said.
Other students reported that they had witnessed Schuman-Kline putting his hands on the student’s butt.
Court documents said that Schuman-Kline became jealous if the student started focusing on other teachers’ homework, and the victim told investigators that “it was not his fault that she had ‘seduced the teacher.’”
A police investigator also interviewed friends of the victim who said that she had confided that Schuman-Kline and the student had sex, but had been interrupted by when the class bell rang.
Authorities confirmed that they were also able to recover the photographs the victim had sent to Schuman-Kline.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-200443854-001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 15:01:23.934852

(Commissioner of Political Practices)Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen has rejected a ballot initiative seeking to limit the power of corporations to spend money on elections, saying it did not meet legal review standards. 
The proposed Ballot Measure No. 4 would amend Article XIII of the state constitution to redefine the powers of corporations (“artificial persons” under the constitution) to state that they have no power to spend money “or anything of value on elections or ballot issues.” The proposal is a response to the Citizens United U.S. Supreme Court decision, which said spending money in elections is equivalent to free speech. 
Jeff Mangan, a former Commissioner of Political Practices in Montana, is the founder of the Transparent Election Initiative behind the ballot initiative known as “The Montana Plan,” and he told the Daily Montanan that he expected the measure to receive pushback from the Attorney General’s Office. 
Knudsen’s office, by law, reviews all proposed ballot initiatives for legal sufficiency and clarity of the proposed language. 
In a memorandum from Knudsen’s office dated Oct. 24, written by deputy solicitor general Brent Mead, the ballot measure is considered legally insufficient and of “significant material harm” to business interests. 
According to the memo, the ballot initiative proposes to both add and revoke powers in the state constitution, which Knudsen’s office says violates a provision of law requiring ballot initiatives to have a single-subject focus and only contain a single amendment. 
“Ballot Measure No. 4 affects diverse government functions across disparate areas of law,” the memo states, listing potential changes across five different Title sections of Montana law. 
The memo also references a fiscal note from the Office of Budget and Program Planning that indicates the fiscal impact of the constitutional change would require the Commissioner of Political Practices hire at least a half-time employee or contract equivalent to “assist with reviewing, determining, and resolving formal complaints including agency-initiated enforcement.”
According to the fiscal analysis, the cost of the employee position would be roughly $96,000 annually. 
It also states that COPP assumes the constitutionality of the ballot issue would be challenged in court, and it would cost from $50,000 to $500,000, “based on past challenges to similar issues.”
But Mangan, who held a series of listening sessions across the state this week, said the Transparent Election Initiative will challenge the legal review in court. 
He told the Daily Montanan in an email that he disagrees with the attorney general’s legal memo for several reasons, including that a legal sufficiency review is supposed to be “a technical gatekeeping function. The memo strays into policy and predictive litigation arguments that go beyond the role.”
“The Montana Plan presents one question to voters — whether Montana should continue granting corporations the power to spend in its politics,” Mangan said. “The components (revoking prior grants, defining permitted powers, parity for foreign corporations, and an enforcement mechanism) implement that single change; they are not separate amendments a voter could logically pick and choose among.”
The AG’s legal memo also states that the Montana Plan would harm business interests in the state by restricting or eliminating “the ability of artificial persons to participate on legislative and regulatory matters affecting them,” and create a competitive disadvantage against non-Montana businesses. 
“Businesses, nonprofits, trade unions, and other associations regularly appear before state and local bodies on legislative and regulatory matters. In other words, they petition their government for redress. Ballot Measure No. 4 revokes this right. Ballot Measure No. 4 goes further and prohibits these associations from lobbying via participation in ballot issues.” 
Mangan says this is a mischaracterization of the ballot initiative, which “does not regulate lobbying.”
“It concerns election spending, including ballot-issue spendings—a different legal category from petitioning or testifying on legislation,” he said. “The measure applies equally to corporations operating in Montana whether chartered in-state or out-of-state, so it doesn’t saddle Montana businesses with a competitive disadvantage that others can evade.”
The Transparent Election Initiative will submit its appeal to the Montana Supreme Court within 10 days of the memo’s publication.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-14-at-4.58.34-PM-1024x628.png,,,2025-10-30 15:01:23.934852

Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) speaks on a press conference on rising health care premiums without ACA tax credits. Oct. 30. | Screenshot. Ahead of Saturday’s start of the open enrollment period for health care under the Affordable Care Act, Michigan’s Congressional Democrats are calling on their Republican colleagues to work to restore the Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire. 
Those tax credits have become a centerpiece of the federal budget debate and the ongoing shutdown of the federal government, which is approaching the one-month mark. Without them, health care premiums will skyrocket, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) said in a virtual press conference held Thursday. 
“At some point, you had to draw the line in the sand. I want to get this government opened again. That means Republicans have to go to work in Washington,” Dingell said. “I hope Speaker Johnson calls us all back. We all get back there. We reopen the government, they do something about health care, so that millions of Americans don’t lose it.”
Dingell and her colleagues have pointed to these health insurance tax credits as a defining budget issue for them since the shutdown began, and have repeatedly called on Republicans to extend them through the coming year. 
“Because Congress has prioritized tax cuts for billionaires over Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, working Americans ae now seeing their health care costs double,” said U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) in a press release from her office. “We can’t afford to wait any longer. Speaker Johnson needs to call the House back immediately so we can stop the health care crisis from landing on Michigan families.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jodie Schanhals, a 62-year-old entrepreneur from Traverse City, joined Dingell and Hertel in the press conference. Her health insurance, she said, will increase by around $1,200 per year without the tax credits. 
“Right now, the Republicans in the House of Representatives are placing me in the middle of this battle. Either we’re not gonna pay the health care subsidies that go along with the ACA, so everybody can get health care, or we’re not gonna feed 40 million people,” she said, referencing the lapse in SNAP benefits set to start on Nov. 1. “I am outraged that this is the choice. It’s so cruel.”
Schanhals, who had hip surgery in 2007, said that she is due to find out if she will need a hip replacement, which she is expected to need. 
“I won’t die from this,” she added. “I just won’t be able to walk.”
“For weeks, they refused to negotiate,” Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel added during the press conference, referring to Republicans. “For weeks, they refused to extend the tax credits that would keep premiums affordable.

Members of the committee heard testimony from supporters of Rep. Matt Maddock’s (R-Milford) House Bill 4915 during last week’s meeting, where Rep. Julie Brixie (D-Okemos) requested an additional meeting for testimony on the bills, saying she’d been unable to ask her questions about the policy. 
The committee did not take further testimony on the bill Thursday, despite an additional request from Brixie to hear testimony, with the committee’s chair, Rep. Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres), saying there had been adequate time for follow up questions with the committee’s minority vice chair, Rep. Kristian Grant (D-Grand Rapids). SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Members of the committee voted along party lines to refer the bill to the House Rules Committee for further consideration, with Hoadley telling the Michigan Advance it’s typical for that committee to further scrutinize any legislation that has to do with rules put forth by government departments. 
Before voting to refer the bill to another committee, members shot down a proposed amendment from Rep. Joe Tate (D-Detroit) which would bar the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs from enforcing implicit bias training requirements unless the content of the training pertains to instruction on the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act – which prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, height, weight, familial status, marital status or source of income – or the Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act, effectively invalidating Maddock’s bill.
Michigan House committee considers ban on bias training requirements for health professionals

After the meeting, Brixie spoke out on the decision to move forward without further testimony on the policy, telling the Advance “the lack of transparency and the fear of the public weighing in on these issues is very disappointing and disconcerting.”
Stephanie Nawyn, an associate professor of sociology at Michigan State University submitted a card in opposition to the bill, but was not permitted to testify at Thursday’s meeting. 
Nawyn previously served as the university’s director of the Center for Gender in Global Context and worked as the co-principal investigator on a grant from the National Science Foundation developing programs to mitigate bias, though she emphasized she was speaking on her own behalf and that her comments did not represent MSU. 
While speaking with the Advance after the meeting, Nawyn said she suspects the bill’s supporters misunderstand what implicit bias is and what the training involves. 
During last week’s meeting, representatives from Do No Harm – a national organization opposing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in health care and gender-affirming care for minors – spoke out against these trainings, calling them divisive, and arguing that these trainings promote discrimination. 
The opposite is true, Nawyn said, questioning why someone would institute training encouraging medical professionals to be biased.
Psychological studies have shown that implicit bias – which the American Psychological Association defines as a “negative attitude, of which one is not consciously aware, against a specific social group” – is particularly hard to address because people do not know that they have it, Nawyn said. 
“To say someone has implicit bias is not to say they are a bad person,” Nawyn said. “It’s just to say that, you know, they have absorbed things unconsciously that might make [them] not as good at providing health care.”
Nawyn also noted that there is a wealth of studies detailing the impacts implicit bias has on health outcomes for patients. 
“There are a lot of health disparities, and some of them are related to biases that doctors may have or other health providers may have,” Nawyn said. “There are certain patients that medical providers may not spend as much time with, may not take their concerns seriously, their reports of pain seriously and those generally lead to detrimental health outcomes for patients.”
While members of Do No Harm argued the training requirements were burdensome for health professionals, and that their time would be better spent reviewing medical literature, Nawyn said the time commitment required for these trainings is not an argument against them. 
“I’ve got probably three or four different trainings sitting in my inbox waiting for me to do that are all about compliance with government rules,” Nawyn said. “So to decide that this particular training is too burdensome when the state Legislature has no problems with all sorts of training that might be required as part of compliance, I think it’s a strawperson argument.” 
While arguments of the bill tend to focus on implicit bias as it applies to race and ethnicity, Nawyn noted the concept addresses a broader range of biases.
“Some of them focus on weight. Some of them focus on disability. Some of them focus on substance use that patients are engaging in – a misuse – socioeconomic status,” Nawyn said. “There [are] so many different biases that people might have, I think it should be left up to medical licensing boards to decide what are important implicit biases that they want their members to address and their decision whether or not to require some training to mitigate those.”

U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Tammy Baldwin of  Wisconsin held a virtual news conference Thursday to discuss the impact of ACA tax credits expiring in Iowa. Iowa is represented by an entirely Republican delegation in Washington, D.C., all of whom have largely placed the blame of the 30-day shutdown on Democrats. While the U.S. House passed a stopgap funding bill in September to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, Senate Democrats have been able to block such a short-term funding measure from passing unless Republicans agree to extend enhanced ACA tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.

Without the extension of these enhanced tax credits, Democrats say health care premiums for people who receive health insurance through the ACA-established Health Insurance Marketplaces may see their premium costs double as open enrollment begins Nov. 1. According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly 137,000 Iowans are enrolled on Marketplace plans in 2025.
Klobuchar said Senate Democrats were calling for Congress to act immediately to extend these tax credits, saying lawmakers cannot wait until December or January to address the issue.
“We are here to talk about this cliff that we’re standing on right now,” Klobuchar said. “It’s nothing that we can wait on. … This marketplace opens up now on Nov. 1, and if Congress doesn’t come together to extend these health care tax credits that greatly help people afford their health insurance, the premiums of these Iowans are going to double next year.”
She said this will cause additional burdens for Iowans who are also facing rising costs and health care shortages, especially in rural areas, due to cuts to Medicaid through the budget reconciliation bill. Without the ACA enhanced tax credits, a 60-year-old Iowa couple earning about $83,000 a year could see their premium increase by more than $13,000 a year, and a family of four making $64,000 could see their premiums increase by more than $2,500 a year, she said, citing data from the organization Keep Americans Covered.
“This is a major factor in rural America and rural Iowa,” Klobuchar said. “… That is a gut punch that too many families simply can’t afford.”
Baldwin said “the expiration of these tax breaks are going to put salt in the wound, frankly, for Iowans and Wisconsinites alike,” as she called for Iowans to reach out to their representatives in Congress and ask for support in extending the tax credits.
“If Donald Trump and my Republican colleagues won’t listen to Democrats, I hope they’ll listen to their constituents who are anxious, and in some cases terrified, about how they’re going to be able to make ends meet with these tax breaks expiring,” Baldwin said. “And to my Republican colleagues — there was plenty of room in the budget to deliver tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations, but what about hard-working Americans so they can afford their health care? The path out of this is so clear.”
Two Iowans who receive health care through the ACA marketplace spoke about the importance of extending these cuts. Lori Hunt of Des Moines said after being laid off from her job earlier in the year, she was able to secure health care through the marketplace. But without the enhanced tax credits, she said, this coverage would be unaffordable.
Having accessible health care is especially important because she was diagnosed with breast cancer three years ago, Hunt said. She has went through radiation treatment and is on a prescription to keep the cancer “at bay” — but said she needs regular health care check-ins and care to ensure future issues do not arise.
“It’s just something I need to keep on top of, (to) keep up with my screenings and to make sure that everything’s okay,” Hunt said. “And when this enhanced Premium Tax Credit goes away, I won’t be able to afford it.”
Jenny Turner, a mother from West Des Moines, said after her husband died of cancer when her son was 7, she transitioned to working part-time from home. She and her son have health insurance through the ACA, she said.
“Without the enhanced tax credits, my premiums are going to more than double, and I was able to get on the website and look that up,” Turner said. “And as hard as it’s going to be for us, I know it’s going to be a lot harder for a lot of other single mothers.”
Iowa’s U.S. House delegation, led by Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, sent a letter earlier in October calling for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to end the shutdown by passing the continuing resolution approved in the House. But Klobuchar said the stalemate is continuing because House Republicans are refusing to negotiate with Democrats on ACA tax credits, and because they do not want to vote on measures related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
“It’s just getting to the point of ridiculousness, because they’ve been out for six weeks — a six week vacation, which I think most Americans could only dream of,” Klobuchar said. “So while that is going on, we are calling on them to come to the table. … The president has a lot of power here. He prides himself on the art of the deal. He can bring people, but they’re together to do this, and that’s what has to happen. So hopefully, when he comes back from his trip to Asia, this will happen, and they’ll call back the House, and we’ll able to work on an agreement.”

(Photo by Madelyn Murphy/Colorado Newsline)The perpetrators of federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration are allergic to transparency.
The most widely recognized symptom of this condition is their habit of masking up. The face-covering gaiter has quickly become a shameful icon for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who’ve terrorized countless communities across Colorado and the country.
But ICE and its partners in the lawless implementation of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program mask up in other ways. As Newsline reporter Sara Wilson recently discovered, the numerous daily flights that crisscross the country to transport immigrants are difficult to track. 
That’s by design.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The flights are run by ICE, which transports people to immigration detention hubs and out of the country to deport them. The operation balloons the catastrophe of detention by putting whole states between family members and undercutting the ability of detainees to seek legal help. 
Think of how a normal criminal prosecution works. A person is arrested on suspicion of violating the law by uniformed, identifiable police officers. That person is booked at a local facility and possibly jailed, but in many cases they have the opportunity to secure pre-trial release, and in all cases they’re given access to legal representation.
Compare that to how faceless, unaccountable immigration officers grab residents off the street and whisk them to locations unknown to family and friends. Most people whom ICE arrests in Colorado have no criminal conviction or charge, and that tracks with the national trend. Despite constitutional rights that are supposed to protect them, they have little expectation of due process or access to legal representation.
ICE flights are a major component of this injustice.
Wilson reported that Colorado-based Key Lime Air, which many customers know as Denver Air Connection, in mid-September started running daily flights of detainees for ICE. Key Lime is the first known Colorado-based company to participate in ICE Air, the agency’s program of removal and domestic transfer flights on charter and commercial airlines. 
Key Lime aircraft shuttle detainees around the country, and they frequent ICE detention hubs, particularly El Paso and Harlingen in Texas, and Alexandria, Louisiana. As part of reporting the story, Newsline journalists observed dozens of detainees exit and enter Key Lime aircraft with their hands and feet shackled.
The reporting didn’t come easy. The Key Lime planes that perform ICE Air work are devoid of company logos. The company appears to have blocked the planes’ registration numbers from at least one popular flight tracking website. When they started ferrying detainees they stopped using the Key Lime flight communication call sign, “LYM.”
Federal authorities communicate very little about the flights. We don’t know the identity of the passengers. And Key Lime was no help. Wilson had a door shut in her face at Key Lime headquarters at Centennial Airport, and when she got CEO Cliff Honeycutt on the phone he quickly ended the conversation.
Much of what is known about ICE flights comes from independent trackers, like Washington-based La Resistencia, and immigration advocates. The New York Times relied on a flight database created by refugee advocate Tom Cartwright when it published an investigation into the Alexandria deportation hub. The Guardian‘s investigation into the hub, which features a detention center on the airport tarmac, found “a pattern of alleged due process violations … neglect and abuse, documented health emergencies and long stays.”
“There is almost no legal access to the center,” the Guardian reported.
ICE leaders want to mask the agency’s detention flights for the same reason its officers want to mask their faces: Their behavior is inhumane and indefensible. And the result is the same: Malign government agents defy transparency and accountability.
But the work of advocates and journalists like Wilson exposes much about the true face of ICE Air.

(Photo by Andrew Kitchenman/Alaskaa Beacon)On Wednesday, the Alaska Supreme Court heard arguments in a legal case that will determine whether or not the state of Alaska may restrict abortion care to licensed physicians.
Since 2019, attorneys representing Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky, have been challenging a state law setting out that restriction. They argue that advanced practice clinicians should be permitted to provide abortion care, even though they are not licensed physicians.
The law, enacted in 1970, has been partially suspended since 2021, which has allowed advanced practice clinicians to perform abortions. In 2024, Alaska Superior Court judge ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood, continuing the suspension. 
The state of Alaska, which opposes Planned Parenthood’s interpretation of the law, appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court in hopes of restoring the law’s effectiveness.
The deciding issue may be whether strict scrutiny applies in the case. Under strict scrutiny, the government bears the burden of proving that a law is constitutional.
In 2024, Alaska Superior Court Judge Josie Garton ruled that strict scrutiny does apply, which contributed to her determination that limiting abortion services to state-licensed physicians violates the Alaska Constitution.
In written briefs to the Supreme Court this year, attorneys representing the state have argued that Garton’s ruling was mistaken; attorneys representing Planned Parenthood have argued in favor of the strict scrutiny determination.
If Garton’s decision on strict scrutiny is overturned, the rest of her decision could follow, and advanced practice clinicians would no longer be legally able to provide abortion care in Alaska.
In Alaska, abortion rights have generally been protected since 1997 by the Alaska Supreme Court’s interpretation of the state’s constitutional right to privacy.
Since then, subsequent editions of the court have repeatedly held that abortion care is health care and thus protected by the right of Alaskans to keep medical decisions private.
Attorney Laura Wolff, representing the Alaska Department of Law, argued Wednesday that the physician-only abortion law doesn’t violate the constitutional right to privacy because few people have been affected.
“The privacy clause analysis requires a significant impairment,” she told the justices. “Not a modest, not a medium, a moderate, a significant impairment, in order to even trigger the privacy clause.”
Attorney Camila Vega, arguing for Planned Parenthood, said some of the group’s clients have been able to access care more often because they no longer have to wait for a doctor to be available.
She said that it would be a mistake for the Supreme Court to require that a minimum number of patients be affected in order to violate the constitution.
“This court has never before required evidence about a threshold number of individual patients to strike down a law, and we would urge the court not to do so here,” she said. “The evidence … shows that since the injunction in this case, patients have been better able to access medication and aspiration abortion. They’ve been doing so for the last four years, and so we respectfully request that the court affirm the order.”
National and local groups filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Planned Parenthood. Standing Together Against Rape, an Alaska group, argued that restricting access to abortion care would harm abuse victims and survivors of sexual assault. 
The national groups argued that advanced practice clinicians are able to provide safe and effective abortion care, and there’s no difference in outcomes between their care and care provided by doctors.
Planned Parenthood has also argued that even if the Alaska Constitution’s privacy amendment does not apply in this case, the abortion-doctor law would violate the constitution’s equal protection clause.
That clause states “that all persons are equal and entitled to equal rights.”
Restricting abortion patients to doctor treatment alone deters them from getting treatment, Vega said.
“For example, if the state offered marriage appointments twice a week, but it said that for same-sex couples, you could only get a marriage appointment once a month, that is a clear equal protection violation,” she said.
The state argued in writing that it has a valid interest “in ensuring that these procedures ending fetal life are performed ethically, professionally, and under a uniform standard,” and because of that reason, the Alaska Legislature intended abortion to be regulated to a higher standard.
At the end of Wednesday’s arguments, Chief Justice Susan Carney said the case will be taken under consideration, with a written order to be published at a future date.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_5120-1024x631.jpeg,,,2025-10-30 14:05:09.464326

A partial government shutdown is almost a month old. 
Congressional Democrats have refused to sign on to a funding bill if Republicans don’t agree to extend subsidies to buy health insurance on marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. 
In the absence of the subsidies — which are scheduled to expire Jan. 1 — health care costs will more than double for 24 million Americans, the health-analysis nonprofit KFF reports. 
Congressional Republicans this summer passed President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
It provides about $1 trillion in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans over 10 years, while it cuts nearly the same amount from Medicaid. 
It also cuts $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, the deepest cuts in the program’s history.
While the Trump bill extended 2017 tax cuts favoring the wealthy, congressional Republicans so far have refused to extend the ACA subsidies, which started in 2021.

As the shutdown resulting from the impasse has gone on, millions of federal employees haven’t been paid, with millions of military personnel potentially joining them on Dec. 1. 
The cuts to food assistance, or SNAP, under the Trump law were already slated to begin phasing in on Nov. 1. But with the shutdown, funding for the program threatens to stop altogether.
Last summer, when the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was passed, operators of Ohio’s food banks said they were already overstretched because high food costs increased the number of hungry people, while also making supplies more expensive. 
That was before they faced complete defunding of SNAP, however temporary — and before some of those unpaid federal workers began to depend on their services.
“While we stand ready to assist those affected, our resources are already stretched thin, with an average of 1.4 million Ohioans visiting our food pantries each month, and a prolonged shutdown will add strain on our network,” the Ohio Association of Food Banks said in a written statement. 
“We are counting on our donors, supporters and communities to step up in any way they can as our network continues its response. This situation underscores the vital role of public-private partnerships in supporting working families.”
Think tank Policy Matters Ohio said that Congress doesn’t need to pass a bill to extend food benefits; Trump has the power to do that unilaterally.
“Past practice and guidance from the Government Accountability Office are crystal clear that the SNAP contingency reserve is available to cover regular SNAP benefits,” Executive Director Hannah Halbert said earlier this week in a written statement. 
“This administration’s choice to deviate from shutdown funding norms suggests their willingness to allow hunger to take a back seat to partisan politics.”
She called on Ohio U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted, both Republicans, to urge Trump to extend the reserve funds to hungry Ohioans.
Husted’s office was asked whether he had asked the Trump administration to look for ways the government can keep SNAP funded. It didn’t respond.
A spokeswoman for Moreno pointed to a bill he had cosponsored. Introduced by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., it would give the secretary of agriculture the power to appropriate money for SNAP — a power that Policy Matters and other organizations contend the secretary and the president already have. 
The bill makes no mention of the expiring health care subsidies. 
Asked if Moreno believed that Senate Democrats should allow those to expire in order to save food assistance, the spokeswoman didn’t respond.
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost on Tuesday led 18 Republican attorneys general in a letter calling on Democrats to end the crisis over SNAP. 
Addressed to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., it urged him to lead his caucus in agreeing to a “clean” funding bill. 
To do that, Democrats would have to abandon their demand for extended health subsidies.
“This does not need to happen,” Yost’s letter said of the loss of SNAP funding. “Congress can stop the threat right now by passing a clean continuing resolution that keeps essential services funded and protects those who rely on them. You have the power to prevent a crisis that is entirely avoidable.”
Yost’s office was asked why the Republican A.G.s didn’t also write to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., given that he has more power than Schumer. 
It was also asked whether Yost was, in effect, pushing for the expiration of the health subsidies. 
It didn’t respond.
As the loss of food assistance looms for a million-and-a-half Ohioans, groups that have been leading protests against Trump called on people to help. 
The No Kings Alliance, which led huge protests across the country Oct. 18, is urging people to give to food banks, support local shelters and organize give-back drives.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-30 17:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How one CT clinic is addressing racial disparities in maternal care,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/30/maternal-care-husky-enrich-health-hamden/,Enrich Health’s approach—which aims to improve maternal and birth outcomes—is aligned with HUSKY’s new value-based payment model.,"Monique Rainford has built a decades-long career as an obstetrician. But, for the last ten years, she’s been grappling with how the traditional health system she’s been a part of has failed to adequately serve Black mothers and babies.
Now she is redesigning maternal care delivery with the lofty goal of eliminating racial disparities. In June, Rainford and her business partner, Andrea Lee, opened Enrich Health, located in Hamden, where the model of care uses clinical strategies that are proven to improve outcomes for expectant mothers who are most at risk. 
The United States has the highest rate of maternal deaths of any high-income nation, according to research published by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that studies health policy. Black and Indigenous women bear the brunt of this underperformance. 
Last year, Black people in the U.S. were more than three times as likely as their white counterparts to die from pregnancy-related causes, according to nonprofit research organization KFF. Their babies were also more likely to be born prematurely or with low birthweight. The gaps persist even when controlling for factors like income and education, “pointing to the roles racism and discrimination play in driving disparities,” researchers wrote.
“The traditional system was not designed for hundreds of thousands of women in America,” Rainford said. “That is part of why disparities are not going away.”
A 2019 study of nearly 7,000 pregnancy-related deaths from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that a Black woman with a college degree was more likely to experience a fatal pregnancy than a white woman without a high school diploma. A working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the wealthiest Black mothers die of pregnancy-related causes at more than twice the rate of the poorest white mothers.

A group-based approach
For Rainford, addressing the problem requires completely reimagining the current system from the ground up.
Her clinic’s model of care incorporates methods proven to drive improvement in the areas where Black women experience worse outcomes. The physicians will monitor specific metrics for their patients, including birth weight, NICU admissions and c-section rates, and then compare them to state averages.
Instead of typical prenatal appointments where patients and providers meet one-on-one for a few minutes, patients at Enrich attend group appointments, which Rainford refers to as “motherhood circles.” 
A 2022 study of 2,400 pregnant women published by the Yale School of Public Health found that group prenatal care dramatically decreased the risks of preterm birth, low birth weight and NICU admissions.
The motherhood circles last roughly an hour and a half, and Rainford meets with all the expectant mothers at once. Doulas and other clinicians also participate, and some appointments include visits from community partners or specialists who offer expertise on topics like fitness, nutrition and lactation. During the session, Rainford conducts quick private check-ins, where she performs a routine obstetric exam and listens to any individual concerns, but otherwise, the entire appointment occurs with the full group. 
“They’re able to sit with a clinician, doulas, and each other — to have time for extensive interaction, community support, engagement, and facilitation. You just can’t do that in 15 or 20 minutes,” Rainford said.
The clinic also accepts patients who want care under the traditional model of one-on-one appointments.
Each patient at Enrich also gets paired with a doula. Research shows that doulas improve outcomes for both the mother and child — reducing rates of C-sections, premature births, and long labors, as well as lowering anxiety and stress.

While Enrich Health is designed to address challenges faced by Black women, patients of any race who feel underserved by the current system are welcome, Rainford said.
“We’re here because traditional care has not worked, and we don’t believe it will ever work to correct the problem,” Rainford said. “The whole goal of this is to use the best evidence from the literature to achieve the outcomes we want.”
How state policy helped open the door
Like many states around the country, Connecticut has tried to address racial equity in maternal care through policy. 
This year, the state Department of Social Services launched a value-based payment model for Medicaid enrollees seeking maternity care. The initiative, known as the “maternity bundle,” contributed to Rainford’s decision to start Enrich Health in Connecticut. 
“We decided to develop this innovative way of paying providers for value to address those racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and birth outcomes,” Fatmata Williams, deputy Medicaid director at DSS and one of the program’s designers, said. It’s also designed to improve outcomes for other groups, as well, like people with substance use disorders, Williams added.
Instead of compensating physicians solely based on the number of services they provide, the maternity bundle compensates them at a flat rate per patient, but also offers them the opportunity to get rewarded for reporting and improving outcomes across ten quality measures. 
Providers get paid for reporting measures like doula utilization, breastfeeding and preterm births. They also receive compensation for performance on metrics including maternal adverse events and low birth weight. 
The model does not penalize providers who don’t meet the marks, Williams said. “This is all upside only,” she said. “If [providers] do well in the quality measures, they get some money for that.”
The state’s approach appealed to Rainford because her clinic’s model was designed to improve many of the outcomes tracked for the maternity bundle.
“That is directly aligned with our revenue model,” Rainford said. “What the state was doing is part of why we even started in Connecticut.”
Enrich Health is still in its early days, but Rainford and Lee, her co-founder, have ambitious plans for the clinic’s expansion and they believe the concept could reshape maternal care nationally. They imagine a future where Enrich Health offers motherhood circles around the country.
“That is our vision,” Rainford said. “To transform health care delivery, first by eliminating health disparities and then giving moms a new option of care.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1016_SR_MaternalHealth_033-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 14:05:09.464326

An Orange County judge Thursday morning agreed to drop Tina Allgeo’s second-degree murder charge after the 47-year-old took a plea deal, pleading no contest to aggravated battery. Allgeo was sentenced to 18 months in prison followed by 10 years of probation.
The local case took on a statewide angle when Uthmeier in September publicly bashed Orlando’s Democratic State Attorney, Monique Worrell,  for pursuing a murder charge against Allgeo, whom Uthmeier believed acted in self-defense under Florida’s Stand Your Ground law. Although Allgeo initially claimed a defense under Stand Your Ground, on Thursday she changed course.

Still, Uthmeier celebrated the dropped murder charge on social media.
“We’re glad to see that Orlando State Attorney Worrell took our advice and dropped the unjust murder charge against Tina Allgeo this morning. Ms. Allgeo clearly acted in self-defense,” Uthmeier posted. “In Florida, we will protect the right to stand your ground against violent aggressors.”

The Allgeo case served as another chapter in the deepening feud between Uthmeier and Worrell, who first clashed through Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2023. When Uthmeier served as the governor’s chief of staff, Worrell was suspended for allegedly neglecting “her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.”
Despite this, Worrell won her seat back in November 2024, unseating the attorney DeSantis had appointed to replace her.
Most recently, Uthmeier last month accused Worrell of refusing to prosecute pedophiles. In April, he said she was slow-walking and ignoring a mounting backlog of cases.
Worrell has denied all wrongdoing, accusing Uthmeier in turn of incompetence.
What happened?
The Orange County Grand Jury indicted Allgeo in February for the second-degree murder with a firearm of 42-year-old Mihail Tsvetkov. Surveillance footage shows Allgeo outside of her car, taking photos of Tsvetkov’s plates. When Tsvetkov drove away, she pursued him and struck his car with hers, the Phoenix previously reported.
A red light camera video then follows Tsvetkov as he exits his car, yanks open Allgeo’s car door, and begins to beat her, seemingly attempting to pull her out of her vehicle. Allgeo then pulls the trigger on her firearm, shooting Tsvetkov “in the face” and killing him almost instantly.
Uthmeier said Allgeo acted under the state’s Stand Your Ground law, which was passed in 2005. The law allows Floridians to use deadly force in self-defense as long as they are not engaged in criminal activity.
Worrell disagreed. During her quarterly meeting, she said, “The Attorney General has political motivations to try to label me as an anti-Second Amendment person; that is not the case,” ClickOrlando reported.
She added that Stand Your Ground still has limitations.
“What those limitations include is one, if you’re the aggressor, you now have a duty to retreat, and two, if you are in the commission of a crime, you have the duty to retreat,” Worrell said.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Republican and Democratic former governors and members of Congress, billionaires and democracy reform organizations are coming to the defense of Maine’s law in a case over the legality of campaign finance restrictions. 
This broad support was demonstrated in amici curiae, or friend of the court, briefs filed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston on Wednesday. These briefs add to the arguments made by the State of Maine and another from the non-profit Equal Citizens and the committee behind the successful referendum in their appeals filed last week. 
In 2024, Maine voters overwhelmingly passed a citizen’s initiative that placed limits on contributions to political action committees that independently spend money to try to support or defeat candidates, commonly referred to as super PACs. 
The state was sued shortly after by conservative PACs, but that had been part of supporters’ plan all along. Their ultimate goal is to get the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that PACs should be regulated.
Latest filings in campaign finance court battle argue Maine has legal right to regulate super PACs

The friend of the court briefs each come at the case in a different way based on each group’s experiences with super PACs. 
In one brief, former elected officials described the pressure candidates feel to court super PACs and then serve the interests of their donors.
Issue One, a nonprofit that seeks to reduce the role of money in politics, filed this brief, which was co-signed by 24 former governors and members of Congress — half of which served as Democrats and half Republicans, including former U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. Others include former U.S. Senate Minority LeaderTom Daschle, a Democrat from South Dakota, former Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and former Republican Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson, who considers himself an independent. 
Another brief was filed by a group of billionaires. They argue unlimited super PAC contributions distort markets and reward insider influence. 
Among those behind that brief are Steve Jurvetson and Vin Ryan, who were some of the largest donors to the ballot question committee behind the 2024 initiative. The others are businessman and television personality Mark Cuban, who was previously a lead investor on Shark Tank, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. 
Several democracy reform organizations filed briefs in which they argued that unchecked super PAC contributions breed corruption. This type of argument was made by the Brennan Center for Justice, the Campaign Legal Center, Demos and Common Cause, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Mainers for Working Families.
They also argued that the current lack of regulations is not supported by legal precedent, which is the overarching defense the State of Maine and Equal Citizens made in their appeals. 
That argument is also fleshed out in an amicus brief filed by the constitutional scholars whose rationale serves as the basis for why  those behind Maine’s law believe the Supreme Court will ultimately rule to reinstate contribution limits. 
The State of Maine and Equal Citizens both made the case that the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission actually allows for super PACs to be regulated. It’s a later lower court ruling, SpeechNow.org v. FEC, that they argue is incorrect. 
In Citizens United, the high court ruled that corporations and unions have the right to spend unlimited money in elections because they have free speech rights under the First Amendment — unless there is a risk of “quid pro quo” corruption, essentially a favor for a favor.
In SpeechNow, the D.C. Circuit Court upheld that contributions to PACs cannot be regulated, either, so long as the PAC is independent. 
In their brief, Harvard Law professor emeritus Larry Tribe, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution Norm Eisen and Chicago Law professor emeritus Al Alschuler (a Maine resident who was part of the group that submitted the original referendum petition) explain that large contributions to PACs inevitably create a risk of corruption because donors and candidates have the opportunity to collaborate even if a PAC is “independent.” 
Therefore, the scholars argue, contributions to PACs can be regulated by Congress.
“There are very few solutions in American politics that unite Republicans, billionaires, and Harvard Law professors,” Equal Citizens Executive Director Maia Cook said in a statement on Thursday. “The fact that our initiative to reinstate super PAC contribution limits has received vocal support from amici like Mark Cuban, Reid Hoffman, Olympia Snowe, and Laurence Tribe demonstrates the strength of our argument: Americans deserve a representative government, by the people and for the people.”

Sunflower County Sheriff James Haywood told Mississippi Today that FBI agents called him early Thursday morning and informed him that Sunflower County Chief Deputy Marvin Flowers had been arrested. The charges involved “public corruption,” but Haywood didn’t yet know the specific charges. The federal sting ensnared “a couple sheriffs in the Delta and numerous police officers,” he said.
“In law enforcement, we’re supposed to set the bar of honesty. We’re supposed to set the bar on trust in our community. We can’t violate it,” Haywood added. “This is devastating news, and we just got to pick up the pieces and regain the public trust.”
The Sunflower County Sheriff’s Department said Flowers was in custody on Thursday and could not provide other contact information for him.
Authorities confirmed the arrests of sheriffs in Washington and Humphreys counties, along with other law enforcement officers in the Delta, in a drug-related investigation. The officials who spoke to Mississippi Today were not authorized to speak publicly about the arrests and did so on the condition of anonymity.
Mississippi has been the site in recent years of other federal probes into local law enforcement agencies that that have resulted in criminal charges and lengthy prison sentences.
In Rankin County, six former law enforcement officers who called themselves the Goon Squad pleaded guilty to federal civil rights offenses for torturing and sexually assaulting multiple men. The Department of Justice has signaled that the investigation into the Rankin County Sheriff’s Office will continue. 
In Holmes County, also located in the Mississippi Delta, the Department of Justice accused the Lexington Police Department in 2024 of engaging in excessive force, illegal searches and sexual harassment.

The utility is exploring if a third-party could buy and operate the coal units. (Photo courtesy of Duke Energy)Indiana regulators on Wednesday approved Duke Energy Indiana’s $3.3 billion plan — plus financing costs — to replace two coal-powered units at the west-central Cayuga Generating Station with natural gas versions.
Included was a settlement with a group of the utility’s largest industrial customers — and an agreement with coal producers to study third-party operation of the retired coal units.
“For generations, our Cayuga power plant in Vermillion County has served the state, and today’s decision ensures it will continue to be a major source of our state’s power generation for decades to come,” a Duke Energy Indiana statement reads, in part.
After more than 55 years in operation, Cayuga is the oldest coal-fired facility left in Duke’s Hoosier portfolio.
Ratepayer protection agency recommends against Duke’s coal-to-gas push

After the replacement, the two combined-cycle natural gas units would add more than 470 megawatts to the aging facility’s current 1005-megawatt capacity.
The undertaking was approved as a “clean energy” project with financial incentives, including the authority to charge ratepayers for financing while the units are under construction.
Duke Energy Indiana estimated the approach would save customers $812 million over the project’s life — predicting a total of $5.3 billion instead of the $6.6 billion expected under a traditional general rate case scenario.
The rate impact will hit in six-month increments, helping “reduce any rate shock that could be otherwise associated with implementing a construction project in base rates through a single step,” the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s Wednesday order reads.
The state agency tasked with protecting utility customers previously asked regulators to reject the plan, calling it “ill-advised” in May. Office of Utility Consumer Counselor witnesses cited the sheer cost, rapidly changing regulations and technological advancements in their testimony.
Duke has estimated that the first tracker filed would add $1.87 to the typical residential customer’s monthly bill. But that amount would rise as construction continues — with the OUCC predicting a total impact of $19.37 monthly.
The agency didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on the approval.
Duke Energy Indiana’s regulatory win comes with a settlement with Reliable Energy, a trade association representing major Indiana coal producers, for a study that could result in third-party operation of the coal units at Cayuga. The group previously opposed the coal-to-gas plan.

Reliable Energy President Savannah Kerstiens said the agreement “represents a significant step toward Governor (Mike) Braun’s vision of ensuring reliable, affordable energy, preserving valuable in-state generation, and strengthening Indiana’s power supply.”
“As power demand continues to rise, a central goal of this vision is to position Indiana as an energy exporter rather than an importer — a milestone that can be achieved by keeping every megawatt of capacity online,” she continued. “Enabling third parties to help advance that effort demonstrates the innovative, entrepreneurial approach that defines Indiana’s energy strategy.”
The proceeds from any sale would flow to the utility’s ratepayers.
Duke Energy Indiana also invoked Braun’s name, saying the settlement “aligns” with recent executive orders “encouraging additions to the state’s power supplies and making sure there’s careful evaluation before retiring coal units.”
The utility will look at the technical feasibility of simultaneously operating the coal and natural gas units, including the potential for “full(y) decoupling” the units.
The study was set to begin as soon as regulators approved the coal-to-gas replacement and has to be done in eight months, at most, according to the settlement agreement.
The filing lays out a detailed list of what must be studied, plus a timeline for Duke Energy Indiana to follow on stakeholder engagement, a request for proposals and bidding process, a due diligence and a negotiations period.
The coal units are scheduled to retire in 2029 and 2030. The utility agreed not to shut them down before 2029 — and to pause demolition during the request for proposals process, until regulators say demolition can continue.

Some clinicians and hospitals are betting on an extension of Medicare coverage for virtual care while others think creatively to cover the costs of care.

For many of the patients served by the Montpelier community health clinic All Brains Belong, being able to access health care through virtual and telehealth care appointments during and after the Covid-19 pandemic was a game changer.
When telehealth care became more widespread, “many patients were able to access health care that worked for them for the first time,” said Mel Houser, the founding physician of All Brains Belong, which focuses on providing care for patients with long Covid, chronic conditions or neurodevelopmental differences.
Even for the region’s large, mainstream providers, the broader flexibility for telehealth has proven crucial to many of their rural patients.
Dartmouth Health, among New England’s largest health care providers, has seen its online consulting with network specialists grow exponentially under new reimbursement rules that quickly became the norm for public and private insurers during the public health emergency.
But those federal rules changed overnight on Oct. 1, as some of the pandemic-era flexibilities that allowed Medicare to cover virtual appointments lapsed with the new federal fiscal year. Health care providers’ advocates nationwide have lobbied for years to make them permanent, and had at least hoped to see Congress approve further extensions as part of the next federal funding bill.
Now, with that funding bill still stalled — and large portions of the federal government shut down — the telehealth practices of small Vermont clinics and large hospital networks alike remain in limbo, along with the Medicare patients they serve. Nearly a quarter of the state’s population is on Medicare — 158,3600 individuals in 2025.
Separately, the lapse in authorization also means video or telehealth appointments can no longer count as the face-to-face encounters that Medicare requires for patients to be eligible for home health or hospice care.
Vermont state law requires that in-state insurers cover telehealth services to the same extent as they would cover the equivalent in-person services. But as a federal program, Medicare — the country’s health insurance program for people age 65 and older and those with certain disabilities — is not subject to that law.
Now that authorizations have reverted to pre-pandemic rules, Medicare covers telehealth — both audio-only and video interactions — only for mental health or substance use disorders, acute stroke treatment, or end-stage renal disease dialysis. For these conditions, updated rules allowing reimbursement for virtual care have been approved already through previous federal legislation. 
But outside those specific kinds of treatments, telehealth visits are currently not eligible for Medicare coverage at all in metropolitan areas, which in Vermont means in and around Chittenden County. In the rural parts of the state, telehealth visits will be covered only if they occur in designated Medicare “originating sites” such as a local clinician’s office.
That rule negates many of the accessibility benefits telehealth opens up, Houser and other providers point out.
Many of her patients rely on the at-home format for a variety of reasons, she said. Some patients are thankful for the freedom from the risks of catching a virus in the clinic. Others appreciate avoiding sensory overload of visiting the office that can overwhelm some people with sensory issues. For another group, virtual visits remove the stress of needing to find or pay for transportation to the office.
Though commercial insurers may follow the standards Medicare sets, both insurers who sell plans on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace — Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP — are continuing to cover most telehealth care, spokespeople for each insurer confirmed to VTDigger. Vermont Medicaid coverage for telemedicine is also not changing.
At All Brains Belong, nearly half of the 350 patients her small clinic serves are on Medicare or Medicaid, Houser said.
While Vermont Medicaid and private health insurers are continuing to reimburse for virtual and telehealth services, Houser said she is now unable to bill Medicare for the care. For now, those patients can self-pay for the service, tapping into the sliding scale costs the clinic is able to offer with a mutual-aid Community Health Access Fund, or cover the cost of services with the clinic’s unique bartering service-exchange program. 
“We are trying to catch people in the gaps,” Houser said. Still, for a small clinic, the loss of cashflow is substantial, she said.  
Banking on a solution
The two largest providers for the state, Dartmouth Health and UVM Health, are continuing to provide telehealth services to Medicare patients and hold onto the bills, rather than seek other payments from Medicare patients. They are banking on the possibility that Congress will eventually act to expand the rules and approve the treatment retroactively.
Dartmouth Health has a broad range of telehealth care for patients in and out of the hospital, said Kevin Curtis, the medical director of Dartmouth Health’s Connected Care program. The network sees about 500 visits per week from Medicare beneficiaries using telehealth to their home, Curtis estimated. Nearly 200 of those patients are Vermont residents, he said. 
At UVM Health, the Network has nearly 40,000 Medicare-related telehealth visits per year, said the network’s spokesperson Annie Mackin.
More than 6.7 million Medicare recipients used telehealth in 2024 — nearly 25% of the population eligible for it, according to claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Utilization in 2023 and 2022 was similar, while the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 saw much higher use, with nearly half of those eligible taking advantage of Medicare coverage for telehealth.  
Primarily, Dartmouth Health’s Curtis sees the need for telehealth care continuity as an access and equity issue, much as Houser at All Brains Belong does. The patients Curtis sees most benefit from at-home telehealth care are those with obstacles to getting to an in-person appointment, whether it’s a physical mobility challenge or no access to a bus or car to reach a clinic. 
For some patients, in the remote reaches of New England that Dartmouth serves, specialty care could be a two-hour drive away, Curtis said. For others, the very nature of their medical condition — like an autoimmune condition — can make getting seen in person a higher-risk endeavor.

Also, Dartmouth Health has embraced telehealth as a great answer to many of the challenges that rural health care systems are facing, he said. It increases individuals’ access to specialists and helps make a hospital’s investment in those specialists more worthwhile.
Their providers have redesigned their physical office space around this hybrid model and now rely on telehealth and virtual appointments, making it difficult to shift their practices. 
“You can’t just say ‘alright, let’s bring 40 patients back in a day.’ There’s no place for them,” Curtis said.  
A barrier to home health care
For Vermont providers of home health care and end-of-life care, the loss of Covid-19 era flexibilities around virtual care has presented its own bevy of difficulties.
For Medicare to cover home health visits or hospice care at home, the federal insurance requires a face-to-face encounter with a provider — which previously could occur remotely, explained Eric Covey, the interim executive director of VNAs of Vermont, the trade association for visiting nurses and other home health care providers in the state.
He described a situation where, without telehealth, homebound Vermonters who may not have access to transportation may delay or forgo their visit with a provider that they need for the approval. “A chronic condition could worsen, and ultimately, they could end up in a situation where their condition worsens to a point that they need to be hospitalized,” he said. 
That outcome is not just detrimental to the individual whose health is at risk, Covey said. It’s less expensive and taxing on the overall health care system to intervene earlier compared to sending someone to the emergency room or more acute care. 
Many patients do receive referrals for home health or hospice care when they are being discharged from the hospital. However, for the small number of individuals who need these referrals through other means, the remote option can be crucial. 
“The issue isn’t the volume. It’s the kind of severity and importance of the need that is about access to care for Vermonters,” Covey said.
It’s this element — the specific need each individual has for this care, rather than the sweeping breadth of all who use and stand to lose it — that concerns Curtis, the Dartmouth Health doctor.  
“We talked about a lot of this in numbers and impact and 500 (visits) a week, but each one of these is a Medicare beneficiary. Each of these (statistics) is one person who is a Medicare beneficiary, who needs care in their rural setting,” he said. “There are still 500 people every week who we just need to get the care to, whatever it takes.”

(Photo courtesy of Maine Family Planning)Starting Friday, primary care services will no longer be available at Maine Family Planning clinics in Presque Isle, Houlton and Ellsworth after the Trump administration barred federal Medicaid funding from going to the reproductive care provider.
The organization, which operates 18 clinics across the state, typically receives about $1.9 million in Medicaid reimbursements each year. Half of Maine Family Planning’s patients, many of whom live in rural areas, rely on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, to pay for health care services.
In a statement Thursday, the organization said they saw more than 600 primary care patients last year. Those patients will now need to find an alternative provider, which will likely be difficult as the state already has a shortage of primary care physicians. 
George Hill, president and CEO of Maine Family Planning, said some of the organization’s patients have been seeing their doctors and nurses for years. 
“Telling those patients we can’t see them anymore has been devastating, especially knowing that some of them will find it too difficult to get a new provider and may just forego care,” Hill said in a statement. 
According to the Rural Health Information Hub, 13 of the state’s 16 counties are considered health professional shortage areas.
Maine Family Planning will continue to provide family planning and reproductive health services, though the organization said those too could be disrupted. Medicaid funding is not used for abortion services but the Trump administration also revoked family planning funding under what’s known as Title X in April.
The shuttering of the primary care practices was initially announced earlier this month after a federal judge denied the organization’s request for a preliminary injunction to block a provision in congressional Republicans’ massive tax cut and spending law that bars Medicaid funding from going to nonprofits that provide abortion services. 
That lawsuit is ongoing and will eventually be heard in the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. In a separate suit, Planned Parenthood, which was also impacted by the new law, was initially granted a preliminary injunction that was later reversed by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in September. 
“While we wait for answers from the court, one thing is clear – the loss of this funding has already caused irreparable damage to our clinics and our community,” said Hill. 
Despite that, both Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England have said they will continue to treat reproductive care patients on MaineCare free of charge as long as they are able.

The two programs, the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) grant and the Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education (SRAE) grant, are designed to “provide sexual health education that is ‘evidence-based,’ ‘medically accurate and complete,’ ‘age-appropriate,’ and ‘culturally appropriate.’
Lawyers for the Department of Health and Human Services argued that removing gender identity from the curricula from these programs would meet the statutory requirement to make the information “medically accurate and complete.” The court pushed back against this statement, citing a broad consensus among the medical community that gender identity and biological sex are distinct. 
“The Court also does not agree that the concept of gender identity ‘fall[s] outside the core medical and biological content that is central to sexual-risk education’,” the order granting the injunction read. “A curricula that denies the existence of transgender and gender diverse people is not medically accurate and complete.”
The state of Michigan, one of the plaintiffs in the case, was facing a loss of nearly $3.4 million in grant funding for the Personal Responsibility Education Program after HHS threatened to pull the funding, according to a press release from Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office. The grant funds programming at 25 school buildings and 8 community-based organizations in Michigan. 
“This unlawful action by the Trump Administration would have put the health and safety of our kids at risk,” Nessel said in the release. “For trans youth, who already face higher rates of bullying, isolation, and health disparities, this attempt to erase their very existence from educational programs was not just cruel but dangerous. I will continue to fight against illegal measures that jeopardize the well-being of Michiganders.”
The states’ original court filing also included the argument that requiring the removal of any mention of gender identity would be in violation of Michigan’s Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, which includes sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression as protected characteristics under the law. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
District Judge Ann Aiken wrote in her order granting the injunction that, “In Michigan, the ‘loss of PREP funding would threaten Michigan’s historic reductions in teen pregnancy, as the program is central to the state’s prevention strategy’.”
The states also argued that, since the funding for this program is appropriated by Congress, the Trump administration and the executive branch imposing new requirements on the funding was an overreach of authority. Aiken agreed. 
“Absent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals,” she wrote in the opinion. “The Appropriations Clause does not provide the Executive branch a tool that it can use to thwart Congress’s will. Quite the opposite.”
The press release from Nessel’s office concurred with that finding.
“Congress created the grant program with clear statutory requirements that are at direct odds with the Trump Administration’s baseless insistence that gender is absolute, fixed, and binary, and that any reference to transgender status or gender identity must be erased altogether,” the release stated.
While a final decision in the suit still has yet to be issued, the injunction will ensure that funding for the programs continues until that decision comes. Aiken also stated in her order that she believes the plaintiffs states are “likely to succeed” on the merits of their claim.

Tyler Clancy, R-Provo speaks at a ceremonial bill signing at the Utah State Capitol on April 15, 2025 (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Shortly after announcing Utah’s current top homelessness leader, former Senate president Wayne Niederhauser, will be retiring Dec. 5, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has picked his successor. 
The governor has appointed another familiar face from the Utah Legislature — Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo — as the state’s next homelessness coordinator, a position that leads the state’s Office of Homeless Services. 
Clancy, however, won’t start in his new role until March 9, after the 2026 legislative session ends. That means the state won’t have a homeless coordinator during a legislative session when unanswered questions remain over how the state will fund expensive plans for a new 1,300-bed homeless campus, with state leaders envisioning it to have hundreds of beds for civil commitment and court-ordered drug treatment. 
Utah homeless coordinator to retire before key legislative session for homelessness funding

But Clancy — who also works as a detective with the Provo Police Department, assigned to the Special Victims Unit and the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force — will continue to serve as a legislator representing House District 60 through the 2026 session. 
And he’s no stranger to homelessness policy. 
After he was first elected to the House in 2023 as the state’s youngest lawmaker at the age of 25, Clancy has worked on legislation to bring more “accountability” and “healing” into Utah’s homelessness system. Earlier this year, he successfully sponsored HB329, a wide-ranging bill that enacted a long list of tweaks to Utah’s homeless system, but most notably it added more safety requirements in homeless shelters, including bag checks. 
Clancy has also sponsored bills related to public safety, drug policy and rehabilitation, “earning recognition from national and local organizations for results-driven leadership,” the governor’s office said in a news release issued Thursday morning announcing his appointment. 
Before being elected to the Legislature, Clancy worked as executive director of the Pioneer Park Coalition, a group of Salt Lake City community and business leaders that advocated for action to address homelessness issues in the Rio Grande neighborhood. 
“Rep. Clancy knows the work on the ground and at the policy table, and that mix will sharpen coordination and results,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “Building on the foundation Wayne Niederhauser laid, we will strengthen Utah’s response and help more Utahns find stability.”
Clancy, in a statement, expressed gratitude for the “opportunity to serve.” 
“Utah does best when we work together with clear goals and real accountability,” Clancy said. “My focus is on coordination that helps people move forward with dignity.”

“There’s so much in this bill that has changed from what we passed here, a lot of it not for the better,” said state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus.
The bill will now go to conference committee, a temporary group of Ohio House and Senate lawmakers that come together to work out differences between versions of the bill. 
State Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, introduced Ohio S.B. 56 in January. 
“I think it’s abundantly clear we need a regulatory structure around hemp and intoxicating hemp products,” said Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon. “We have some issues to work out, but I’m confident we can work those issues out.”
The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC.
As S.B. 56 is currently written, only a licensed hemp dispensary would be able to sell intoxicating hemp products to adults 21 and older. 
The dispensaries would be required to meet standards for testing, advertising, and packaging. A 10% tax would be added to intoxicating hemp sales. 
The bill would limit the number of active hemp dispensaries to 400. 
The bill would allow certain hemp dispensaries to be grandfathered in if they sold intoxicating hemp products on or before Aug. 30 and hemp products sales surpassed 80% of their total sales for 2024 or the 12 months before the bill takes effect. 
Ohio Sen. Shane Wilkin, R-Hillsboro, said the bill fails to close the loophole for synthetic THC. 
“The bill would also allow for an enormous amount of hemp dispensaries to be placed around the state with no restrictions on how close they could be to a marijuana dispensary,” he said. “… Additionally, there would be grandfathering of those currently selling these unregulated, untested products.” 
THC-infused beverages are also included in the bill. 
A bar or restaurant would be able to sell 5 milligram THC-infused beverages for patrons to drink on site, while a store would be able to sell 10 milligram THC-infused beverages for carry-out. 
“There are several changes to the marijuana law, as well as drinkable hemp beverages that I believe need more vetting,” Wilkin said. 
On the marijuana side, the bill would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, limit the number of active marijuana dispensaries and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. 
Ohio recreational marijuana sales topped $702.5 million in the first year. 
Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment. 
The bill would give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries and people would also be able to apply for expungement of low-level marijuana convictions. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced earlier this month a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that started on Oct.14, but a Franklin County Court of Common judge has placed a temporary restraining order on DeWine’s ban until Dec. 2.  
“The people of Ohio want us to do something about these products,” DeMora said. 
“The governor tried to do something, and was stuck because he didn’t do it the proper way. It is up to us to make sure now that we can do something to end these things to get out of the hands of kids.” 
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said she welcomes conference committee. 
“We feel a sense of urgency as well,” she said. “The other thing we’re aware of is get this right while there’s this pause in the governor’s ban to get it done.”

Ned Lamont said he's ready to work with Zohran Mamdani, the frontrunner in the New York City mayoral race, if he wins next week.","Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont is ready to work with Zohran Mamdani, the frontrunner in the New York City mayoral race, if he wins next week’s election.
On CNN Thursday morning, Lamont said Mamdani has run a great campaign.
If he wins?
“Now it’s time to transition,” Lamont said. “Is he a mayor who can govern? Part of that’s going to be reaching out to the business community and Wall Street and saying, ‘I’m here to fight for all the people.’”
Lamont specifically credits Mamdani with focusing on affordability on the campaign trail, a top issue for Americans nationwide.
However, he echoed popular sentiments that have followed Mamdani on the trail; that he’s a 34-year-old New York State assemblymember with only a few years of experience in elected office.
“I think Mamdani, better than any of the other Democrats, is really making affordability front and center. That’s why he’s a very strong frontrunner in this race,” Lamont said. “I am reminded, though, of what George Washington once told Alexander Hamilton: ‘Revolutions are easy, governing is hard.’ So we got to think about the next step.”
Mamdani, a self-described democratic-socialist, has turned heads with his proposals. He wants city-run grocery stores, a rent freeze for stabilized tenants, free city buses, and higher taxes on the city’s wealthiest 1%.
He is 10 points ahead of former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in the polls. Lamont had endorsed Cuomo before the primary.
Election day is Tuesday, Nov. 4. More than 370,000 New Yorkers have already voted.

(Photo by  krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images)State regulators have issued an emergency order suspending the license of a registered nurse who provided home health care for disabled children and is now facing charges related to child pornography.
The Iowa Board of Nursing has issued an emergency order suspending the license of registered nurse Kenneth Wayne Clark of Ankeny. The order is based on a disciplinary charge that Clark has engaged in unethical behavior or practices that are harmful or detrimental to the public by acting in a manner that is contradictory to professional decorum.
Court records show that on Aug. 1, 2025, Wayne’s home and vehicle were searched by the Polk County Sheriff’s Office. The sheriff’s office alleges it found methamphetamine, psilocybin mushrooms, and marijuana, as well as multiple pieces of drug paraphernalia — including glass pipes, bongs and storage containers for marijuana and methamphetamine.
On Sept. 9, 2025, Ankeny police alleged that from March 1, 2025, to July 30, 2025, Clark knowingly and unlawfully downloaded or possessed on his cellphone videos that are “consistent with child sexual abuse material.”
Prosecutors have charged Clark with 10 counts of purchasing or possessing the depiction of a minor engaged in a sex act. Police records indicate there are more than “2,600 unclassified videos and 60,511 images” at issue in the case, including at least 50 videos “consistent with child sex abuse material” that were allegedly downloaded onto the phone.
Last month, the court entered a no-contact order against Clark barring any contact with minors.  The Board of Nursing alleges the no-contact order is particularly relevant to its emergency order in that Clark was “doing in-home care for disabled children” prior to his arrest.
The board alleges Clark declined to sign a voluntary agreement not to practice nursing while the court case is pending, resulting in the emergency order.

Read this story in English.
Al comienzo de un nuevo año escolar, aumenta el número de niños que reportan necesidades graves de salud mental. Muchos se enfrentan a la ansiedad y el estrés al regresar a la rutina escolar diaria.
Para las familias de Connecticut con niños que necesitan atención de salud mental, los Centros de Crisis Urgentes ofrecen tratamiento de emergencia. Los UCC (Centros de Crisis Urgentes) tienen como objetivo apoyar a los niños que experimentan crisis de salud mental brindándoles acceso a tratamiento y apoyo.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre estos centros y lo que pueden hacer por los niños.
¿Qué es un Centro de Crisis Urgente?
Los Centros de Crisis Urgentes son instalaciones financiadas por el Estado y operadas por entidades privadas que ofrecen tratamiento para niños con necesidades urgentes de salud mental. Funcionan como una alternativa a los departamentos de emergencias hospitalarias, lo que permite que los niños permanezcan en sus hogares durante el tratamiento en lugar de recibir atención hospitalaria.
Están equipados para manejar crisis como pensamientos suicidas o autolesiones, sentimientos de depresión o ansiedad, abuso de sustancias y más. Sin embargo, no son departamentos de emergencias equipados para brindar atención médica inmediata. Para emergencias médicas, los centros indican a las familias que llamen al 911 o visiten el hospital más cercano.
Para niños y adolescentes de 18 años o menos, el personal capacitado de los centros trabaja para reducir las crisis de salud mental, completar evaluaciones y conectar a los jóvenes con los servicios. La mayoría de los seguros son aceptados en todos los centros. Alrededor de la mitad de los niños tratados en los UCC de Connecticut tienen seguro de Medicaid.
Para atender a los residentes de las zonas más rurales de Connecticut, los Centros de Crisis Urgentes también trabajan con servicios móviles de intervención en crisis de emergencia, también conocidos por los proveedores como Centros Móviles de Crisis, que brindan servicios similares a los hogares de los niños, para garantizar que se aborden las necesidades inmediatas de salud mental.
¿Cómo acceder a ellos?
Hay cuatro ubicaciones en Connecticut: Hartford, New Haven, New London y Waterbury. Funcionan sin cita previa y brindan acceso inmediato a recursos de salud mental. Hay 72 plazas diarias en cada centro.
En Hartford, las familias pueden visitar “The Village for Families and Children”. De lunes a viernes, están abiertos de 7 a.m. a 11 p.m. Los sábados y domingos, están abiertos de 3 p.m. a 11 p.m.
En New Haven, las familias pueden visitar el Hospital Yale de New Haven. En todo el Sistema de Salud de Yale New Haven se ofrece atención médica de emergencia para niños en todo momento, en cada departamento de emergencias y centro de atención urgente.
En New London, las familias pueden visitar la Agencia para Niños y Familias del Sureste de Connecticut. Abren de lunes a viernes, de 8 a. m. a 10 p. m. y los sábados de 10 a. m. a 6 p. m.
En Waterbury, las familias pueden visitar “Wellmore Behavioral Health”, una organización sin fines de lucro que opera el centro de crisis. Para hacer una derivación u obtener ayuda, el centro recomienda a las familias llamar al 1-855-WELLMORE.
¿Qué tan exitosos han sido?
En 2022, la legislación estatal estableció los Centros de Atención de Crisis Urgentes (UCC, por sus siglas en inglés) en respuesta al aumento de la demanda de atención de salud mental, citando un repunte en los suicidios juveniles desde la pandemia. Comenzaron a operar al año siguiente. Desde su apertura, miles de niños han visitado estos centros, y más del 95% de los visitantes han podido regresar a casa después de su visita sin necesidad de ir a la sala de emergencias.
“Esa es una tasa de éxito fenomenal. Es una tasa de éxito que no vemos en la mayoría de los otros servicios que brindamos”, dijo Hector Glynn, director ejecutivo de The Village for Families & Children.
Los padres cuyos hijos han recibido tratamiento en los centros han dicho que están satisfechos con el apoyo que ofrecen los UCC. “Cuidarán de su hijo. Se ha convertido en nuestro refugio seguro”, dijo Lisa Paradis, una madre cuya hija ha recibido tratamiento en los centros de crisis, el mes pasado.
¿Cómo se sostienen?
A pesar de los resultados favorables, el futuro de los UCC y los centros móviles de crisis se ve amenazado por la falta de financiación.
La financiación de los UCC depende principalmente de las asignaciones del presupuesto estatal a través de Medicaid. Pero aproximadamente la mitad de los pacientes que atienden los centros no están cubiertos por Medicaid, lo que significa que los centros no pueden acceder a gran parte de ese dinero. Además, el seguro privado generalmente tiene tasas de reembolso más bajas que Medicaid. Muchos pacientes con seguro privado también tienen planes de atención médica con deducibles altos y no pueden pagar las tarifas. Cuando no pueden pagar, las organizaciones sin fines de lucro condonan la deuda.
El programa de atención móvil en situaciones de crisis recibió aproximadamente 8,6 millones de dólares en el año fiscal 2027, pero nada en el año fiscal 2026, que comenzó el 1 de julio. Este verano, los funcionarios estatales estaban considerando la posibilidad de utilizar fondos no gastados de la ayuda para la COVID-19 para mantener los centros operativos hasta finales de año e integrar cualquier otra financiación adicional que pudiera ser necesaria para sostener sus operaciones hasta 2027.

A nurse practitioner who has specialized in allergy and asthma care for more than two decades, she was forced to close three of her rural allergy clinics in central Missouri and consolidate her practice at her clinic in Columbia.
Why? Missouri is one of 11 states that require advanced practice nurses such as Markes to have oversight from a physician.
The rules on how nurse practitioners can see patients in Missouri are meticulous. Nurse practitioners must be within 75 miles of the physician who oversees them on a daily basis, and physicians must sign off on the nurse’s patient records.
When Markes’ overseeing physician got reassigned during COVID and was moved out of the 75-mile radius from her clinics, she had no choice but to close them.
“There was no way I could be at those clinics and be within the mileage of where he was,” Markes said. “So I closed three rural clinics just for specialty care.”
Some of her patients followed her to Columbia, but others lost care.
“You have to take a day off work, or you have the gas money to get here,” Markes said. “It just adds to health care dollars. And it’s not direct … you have to get there first.”
While the rules were designed to keep patients safe, nurses say they don’t do much to improve the care those patients get. In fact, they argue it is a roadblock to Missourians’ access to primary care or mental health providers.
And while advanced practice nurses like nurse practitioners and midwives have been pushing for decades to get the law changed in Missouri, there’s been almost no momentum in the state legislature.
So Markes is suing Missouri. 
Using an often overlooked part of the state constitution that guarantees the right to earn a living, Markes is hoping that challenging the state’s requirement could lead to better health care for Missourians.
In states where nurse practitioners can practice individually, overall health ranks were 17 spots higher than in states with reduced practices, like Missouri.
And patient access in states where nurse practitioners can practice independently is higher. States with individual practice rights ranked 19 spots higher than states without when it came to patients’ access to care.
 How Missouri’s oversight works 

Missouri is one of only 11 states that still require advanced practice nurses to have oversight from a physician, formally called a collaborative practice agreement.
Nearly every Missouri county has been designated a health professional shortage area when it comes to primary care and mental health care. Recent nationwide data shows that 66% of designated shortage areas were in rural parts of the country.
Research also shows that nurse practitioners are more likely to practice in rural communities. Nationwide, 88% of nurse practitioners are certified in primary care, according to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners.
In Missouri, independent physicians can set the rates they charge to nurse practitioners for their time and oversight.
For Markes, who provides speciality care with oversight from a pulmonologist, it is no small cost.
She budgets more than $50,000 annually to pay her collaborating physician, who she said has little impact on how she cares for patients or runs her clinic.
“He’s there when I need him,” Markes said of her overseeing physician. “There can be as much or as little collaboration, depending on who you’re working with.”
By running her own clinic, Markes is in a unique position. She takes on the cost and administrative burden of meeting the legal requirement of physician oversight.
For nurse practitioners who are part of larger health systems, the hospitals assign an overseeing physician and pay them a bonus for their review. But, practitioners say, the review is retroactive, and mostly means additional time spent looking at patient records that could be spent seeing more patients.
“It’s time that could be better spent taking care of your patients, rather than worrying about the collaborative practice agreement,” said Dawn Stout, a family nurse practitioner in Trenton, near the Iowa border.
Nationwide, 27 states allow nurse practitioners to practice to the full extent of the licensing.
There are limits to what nurse practitioners without full authority can do. They have limits in what medicines they can prescribe, making things like mental health care or pain management especially difficult.
“I have issues maintaining good pain control,” Stout said. “I’m limited to a five-day prescription for narcotics, so I have to jump through the hoop of getting my (physician) to sign off on them.”
Ultimately, nurse practitioners say that beyond checking patient care records and the occasional oversight on what can be prescribed to their patients, they usually don’t have much communication with their physicians or oversight from the state.
“I’ve been at this facility almost 15 years,” Stout said. “Nobody has ever come and checked on our charts to see how many are signed by a physician.”
In an email, the Missouri Board of Healing Arts and the state Board of Nursing, which oversee physicians and nurses respectively, said there is no requirement for state boards to verify collaborative practice agreements.
Physicians must report if they have nurse practitioners they oversee. Otherwise, there is no routine interaction between the boards and the nurses and physicians they oversee.
“It’s a retrospective review,” said Donna Matias, an attorney at Pacific Legal Foundation who is representing Markes in her case against the state. “And there is no enforcement of the review. I have talked to plenty of nurse practitioners who have said, ‘I have never even met my collaborating physician.’’’
“What it does signal is that this is not about health and safety,” she said.
In 2024, legislation to eliminate collaborative practice requirements was introduced in the Missouri House of Representatives. The bill would have removed the requirement for nurse practitioners to have an overseeing physician after 2,000 hours of work — less than a year of full-time nursing practice.
Groups like the Missouri Farm Bureau and individual Missouri nurses submitted testimony in support, citing the changes the legislation could make for patient access.
The Missouri State Medical Association, the Missouri Academy of Family Physicians and individual physicians and osteopathic doctors testified against the legislation, arguing that 2,000 hours is not enough time for a nurse practitioner to gain skills. They also argued the bill would degrade the extensive training other medical professionals receive.
“One thing I do like about collaborative practice is I always have a resource at my fingertips if I need something,” Stout said. “But that same resource would be there even without the collaborative practice agreement.”
 How could full practice authority change patient access to primary care providers?

Although the number of nurse practitioners is growing in Missouri — the state has 16,715 advanced practice registered nurses, double what it did 10 years ago — nurse practitioners are also taking their skills elsewhere.
Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas have all granted advanced practice nurses full practice authority, while Illinois and Arkansas have granted full authority with a few restrictions.
For Terry Thomas, a nurse practitioner who sees patients in Hannibal, making the move from Nebraska to Missouri after the pandemic was complex.
“It was very difficult going from a state with full practice authority in Nebraska to Missouri, which is one of the most restricted states in the U.S. when it comes to nurse practitioners,” Thomas said.
Usually, Thomas said, nurses near state lines will decide to practice in other states.
Stout, the family nurse practitioner in Trenton, is also licensed to practice in Iowa.
“People I’ve known over the years that are from this area, they’re like, ‘I’m not dealing with the restrictions that Missouri has.’ And they’ll go to a state that doesn’t have collaborative practice because it’s so restrictive,” Stout said.
It’s also becoming more difficult to find a physician to oversee your practice, nurse practitioners say. The number of physicians who practice independently is waning, and taking on the liability of another medical professional’s care is a hard sell.
About 77% of physicians in the U.S. are now employed by hospital systems or corporate entities, up sharply since 2019. In the Midwest, hospital or corporate owned practices have increased nearly 40% since 2019.
Acquisitions of private practices by corporate entities skyrocketed 87% from 2019 to 2023 in the Midwest.
“You start adding in 20, 40, 60 extra charts a week that you have to read through,” Stout said. “Physicians don’t want to take on nurse practitioners because it increases their workloads so much.”
Still, there is a projected shortage of 87,000 primary care physicians nationwide by 2037. And in 2022, more than half of working primary care doctors reported burnout.
A 2018 study used Medicare data to track health outcomes with patients who used nurse practitioners as their primary care providers. The data found those patients had lower rates of hospital admissions or readmissions and lower rates of improper use of the emergency room, compared to patients of primary care medical doctors.
States began passing legislation to allow for full practice authority in the 1990s, beginning with Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, Alaska and Oregon. Currently, 27 states allow full practice authority, while 12 have reduced authority and 11 states still require nurse practitioners to have supervision by a physician.
Ultimately, nurse practitioners know that even with full practice ability, they don’t have the same knowledge and training physicians do. And by suing the state, Markes isn’t trying to ban physician oversight for nurse practitioners.
But she does want to end the state-mandated requirement.
“In rural areas, you need to have access to physicians. Having independent practice means providers who normally would not go into rural areas could see patients there,” Markes said. “That’s where all of this stems from, is the ability to take care of people.”

(Photo by Mac Stone, courtesy of Open Space Institute)COLUMBIA — More than 62,200 acres along three South Carolina rivers are permanently protected after the state Forestry Commission closed the deal on a record-breaking conservation easement, officials announced this week.
The public will have access to around 7,500 acres of the land, which spans parts of Georgetown, Williamsburg and Marion counties. A portion of that will join the nearby Wee Tee State Forest, and the rest will become wildlife management areas managed under the Department of Natural Resources, according to a news release.
Called the Pee Dee Basin Project, it protects land around the Black, Pee Dee, and Santee rivers.
Officials touted the project Wednesday in a celebration at Georgetown County’s Pea House Landing, a public boat landing looking out on parts of the Black River, one of 10 segments officially designated by the state as a scenic river.
Largest conservation easement project in SC history underway with $50M grant

The rest of the property will remain private forestland, allowing sustainable timber harvesting to continue. The conservation easement, which is the largest in state history, will limit other activities on the property, according to conservation group Open Space Institute.
“This project is of incomparable scale and extraordinary impact,” said Marie Whitehead, who led the partnership for the land conservation group. “And while it’s been a herculean task to get it over the finish line, this project has been a highlight of my 25-year career.”
Most of the project’s funding came from a $50 million federal Forest Legacy grant, one of the largest of its kind, according to Open Space Institute. The remaining $24 million came from a combination of private investments, grants and state taxpayer dollars.
That included about $3.3 million for the addition to the state forest, according to state budget documents.
This is the first time the state Forestry Commission has held a conservation easement, according to the agency.

With more than 20 miles of land along the Santee, Black and Pee Dee rivers, preventing development will help reduce flooding. At least 115 plant and animal species considered a priority for protection also live on the protected land, according to Open Space Institute.
Officials said they hope the project, which included more than a dozen partners for funding and coordination, can act as a blueprint for more large conservation efforts to come.
“By protecting these timberlands, we’re investing in our future — supporting rural jobs, boosting our outdoor recreation economy, and protecting riverside communities from flooding,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a news release. “This project establishes a replicable model for large-scale conservation in the future, and we are grateful to our partners who contributed to its success.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MacStone_240814_0350-1024x683.webp,,,2025-10-30 10:57:11.480101

This article is part of a series on the environmental costs of America’s last remaining alumina refinery.

GRAMERCY — A cloudy, rust-colored liquid plume, roughly the size of a football field, flowed into the Mississippi River last week out of a drainage pipe from the Atlantic Alumina refinery in the River Parishes.
Recent state records indicate this runoff into the river is dangerously caustic and the amount has well exceeded what’s allowed under federal environmental standards. It continues a pattern spanning several months during  which the company has struggled to contain toxic releases from its facility despite heightened public scrutiny over previous violations of environmental laws and workplace safety regulations.
About 45 miles west of New Orleans, Atlantic Alumina, which also goes by the name Atalco, is the only bauxite refinery in the United States. The facility turns bauxite, a reddish-brown rock full of various metals, into alumina, a white, powdery substance used to make aluminum. 
Aerial photos the Illuminator took Oct. 21 show whirls of discoloration on the river’s surface next to Atalco’s import dock and white alumina powder near its export dock. The pictures were taken during a flight provided by the nonprofit aviation group SouthWings. Members of the environmental advocacy organization Healthy Gulf were also on the flight.
Scott Eustis, Healthy Gulf’s community science director, said the plumes are likely hazardous chemicals and byproducts from Atalco’s refining operations. Both the discolored water and white powder are consistent with previous discharges Eustis said he’s seen at the same locations. 
“For years, we have watched Atalco dump into the Mississippi River and use the engine of our estuarine land as waste disposal,” Eustis said. “They are not investing enough in their own operation to prevent this product loss.” 
Atalco has not responded to multiple requests for comment for this article and previous ones since the Illuminator first reported on its recurring contamination problems in June. 
The runoff seen last week on the river aligns with the location of one of the Atalco facility’s outfall pipes as indicated on drainage maps on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. Residents and environmental groups have documented discharges at the same site Sept. 26 and dating back to November 2022.  
According to a state permit, the drainage line carries treated process wastewater Atalco uses for some of its industrial operations. LDEQ requires Atalco to treat the wastewater to neutralize hazardous contaminants and monitor the volume and pH of any discharges going into state waterways. Its river outfall systems have sensors that continuously track those measurements, and the company has to report them to LDEQ every month.
Clean water generally has a neutral pH of 7 on a 14-point scale. Extremes at either end of the scale can be dangerous. A substance with a pH over 11.5 is generally corrosive enough to eat through concrete, soft metals and organic matter like skin, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
Under the provisions of its river outfall permit, Atalco can discharge wastewater with a pH over 10 for no more than seven hours per month, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standard. 
A report the company filed with the state detailing its river outfall sensor data from September shows Atalco discharged water with pH readings up to 13.4 for nearly 144 hours over the month. That’s equal to six days with highly acidic discharge more than 20 times permitted levels.

“The facility continues to manage rainwater from weather events and plant upsets,” Atalco executive Steven Smith wrote in a section of the September report where the company is asked to explain the violation. He did not include specifics on when the rain and weather caused the excessive discharges. The area where the refinery is located experienced very little rainfall that month, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
Atalco’s river outfall reading for September wasn’t just a one-off. A review of LDEQ records going back over two years revealed the facility exceeded its Mississippi River drainage permit in 25 of the last 27 months. The Illuminator’s previous reporting detailed even greater discharge volumes in several of those months. 
Photos from last week show the thickest and cloudiest areas of discoloration on the river surrounding a spot of aerated white water jetting out from the river bank and in line with a drainage pipe coming from the facility that runs through the levee and empties into the river. 
LDEQ spokesman Greg Langley, who reviewed the Illuminator’s photos, said Atalco is permitted to discharge into the river at regulated amounts. He said some of the discoloration could be sediment from the riverbed disturbed by the force of the discharges coming from Atalco’s drainage pipe. 
Eustis, who has monitored pollution events in the Mississippi River for years, said water conditions in the Mississippi River at the Atalco refinery this year are some of the worst he has seen.
“Atalco has neglected its waste ponds and shorted its workers,” Eustis said. “That is the cause of the red, white and brown plumes in the river. We must report each trespass upon our waters.”
A Louisiana refinery spilled toxic waste into the community and knew about it for months

Activists push for steeper fines
In August, the LDEQ issued the company a “Notice of Potential Penalty” compliance order that detailed violations officials documented during a series of inspections that began over a year ago. The agency is also asking the company to address a slate of new requirements regulators have tacked onto Atalco’s solid waste permit renewal application, records show.
The infractions involve the “red mud” lakes Atalco has built on site to hold the toxic slurry produced during the bauxite refining process. In June, an Illuminator investigation found Atalco had polluted public land and state waterways with toxic waste and heavy metals for months without notifying neighbors. 
The state has also asked Atalco to disclose its financial statements to determine if the company made more money because it ignored environmental laws. This is a routine request regulators make when trying to determine penalties for violations.
In an Oct. 22 letter to LDEQ, an attorney for Atalco refused the agency’s request, adding the company would request an administrative hearing on the allegations. Atalco denies it benefited financially from not following the rules, and the company intends to submit a settlement offer to the state to close its case, the lawyer wrote.
It’s unclear how much money Atalco makes, but its parent company, London-based Concord Resources Ltd., is worth billions. Concord, a private company that bills itself as a global commodities trader focused on metals and mining, reported €2.7 billion ($3.12 billion) in total income for 2023, according to its annual report. The report did not break down how much of that income came from Atalco. 
If the Department of Environmental Quality accepts Atalco’s settlement offer, it would go to Attorney General Liz Murrill for a 90-day review and concurrence period, according to the agency’s rules for settlement negotiations. That process includes a 45-day public comment period before the settlement is finalized.

The state can levy fines ranging from $100 to $32,500 per violation depending on its severity and the degree of risk it poses to public health or property. 
The agency uses a penalty matrix to determine whether the violation is minor, moderate or major. A violation is considered major if the hazard is one of “frequent occurrence and/or high pollutant concentrations,” according to LDEQ regulations. The agency can then adjust the penalty based on other specific factors, including the company’s history of previous violations, its gross revenues, degree of culpability or defiance, failure to mitigate the damages and whether the company immediately reported the violation or tried to conceal it. 
Following a 2017 compliance inspection, the state cited Atalco for 78 state Environmental Quality Act violations mostly related to the company’s air pollution permit. In 2020, the state accepted a settlement offer of $75,000 and allowed Atalco to deny wrongdoing. 
The refinery has a history of violations. In 2015, regulators discovered it had been unlawfully emitting mercury into the air for decades. The company, then called Noranda, did not have a permit to release mercury at the time. The Department of Environmental Quality levied a $95,000 fine and issued a permit that allowed the facility to continue releasing mercury into the air, according to The Times-Picayune. 
Healthy Gulf is calling for harsher financial punishment against Atalco to deter the company’s continued pollution of the river, neighboring property and drainage areas, Eustis said.
“We press LDEQ to increase Atalco’s fines until that economic signal shakes some sense into the company,” he said.

John James? 
Those were just a few of the questions parsed Wednesday by Michigan’s Republican candidates for governor in one of three early debates scheduled 10 months out from the August primary.
The candidates who attended the event, which was as much a debate as it was a GOP fundraiser, were Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, pastor Ralph Rebandt, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, and anti-property tax advocate Karla Wagner.

Not in attendance was James. The Shelby Township Republican was notably missing, despite being invited to the event and featured on the party’s promotional materials.
The James campaign, hours before the fundraiser, said he would consider a primary debate with his fellow candidates once the field whittles down “and will be speaking to Michiganders in the meantime.”
Instead of attending the debate, James appeared on FOX 2 Detroit’s “The Pulse” with reporter Roop Raj.

Meanwhile, back at the debate, Michigan Republican Party Chair Jim Runestad said the event was sold out, filling the nearly 200-seat Apple Valley at Sunset Ridge venue in Sparta, Michigan, located just north of Grand Rapids.
Each of the candidates were given instructions to stick to the topics at hand and not throw jabs at one another for a clean debate.
Adherence to that request lasted all of one minute, with Nesbitt and Cox hitting James for not showing up right out of the gate.
“I want to thank my colleagues for actually showing up here,” Nesbitt said in his first response. “The first step of winning next year is actually showing up. … It’s unfortunate that John James decided not to show up today, and after two times that he’s lost statewide, I think it’s going to be important. If we don’t figure it out, that next year is [going to be] the third time.”

Adding to the shade were a pair of milk cartons sitting at Nesbitt’s supporter tables, each with “missing” announcements featuring James.
Cox said, “Amen to Brother Aric.”
“We don’t grow Michigan by electing people who don’t show up to work, by electing people who are abandoning President Trump’s majority in the House and now abandoning all of you,” Cox said.
With that, the debate began. Here are a few of the key responses to questions posed to the  candidates who did attend. The questions are in bold and the candidates’ responses follow.
 
How would you grow Michigan’s population?
Nesbitt: You got to have a governor that takes an ax and burn down that red tape to actually allow businesses to succeed and work here. If we’re going to make it here in Michigan, that means we got to lower the cost of insurance, lower the cost of government, lower the cost of taxes, so that our families, our business owner[s], most importantly, our kids, can actually make it here in Michigan.
Cox: Number one, we eliminate the tax on work, the income tax, because the nine fastest growing states, not only by wage growth, not only by job growth, but population growth, have all eliminated the tax on work, the income tax. Prosperity results when you do that.
Wagner: Everybody knows what I’m going to say, right? Property tax elimination. We need to eliminate property taxes in the state of Michigan. I see this as the only solution to the loss of our businesses, our people and our revenue out of the state. When the people prosper, the state will prosper.
Rebandt: [People] want affordable housing and … removing property tax will make homes more affordable. [Residents are] looking for an environment to raise a family.
Hudson: I’m a big advocate for getting rid of property taxes, but for different reasons. It’s going to happen somewhere, folks. … Why can’t we do it here in Michigan first? Why can we be a leader? When you eliminate property taxes, it’s not just for the residents, it’s for these businesses. You’re telling the rest of the country, “Hey, Michigan is open for business.”
Leonard: First and foremost, we need to make Michigan a Right to Work state, again. When Right to Work was repealed a couple of years ago, we were 36 out of 50. Not good enough, but it’s a lot better than the 49 out of 50 we are now. We were actually at the national average for unemployment. Now we are 1.4% higher. Bring back Right to Work, eliminate the income tax.

How would you change Michigan’s education system to ensure the state is no longer one of the lowest performers in fourth grade reading levels?
Cox: We spend $21 billion every year, and our outcomes are in the bottom five. So it’s not really money. … I would issue an executive order opting Michigan into President Donald Trump’s school choice tax credit. I would push for greater school choice, and I mean public, private and homeschool.
Wagner: I don’t think that we need to do that. I think that maybe the teachers need to be graded on how well the kids do. Maybe the schools need to be graded on how well the kids do. We absolutely have to make it easier for people to home school their kids, send them to Christian School.
Rebandt: This is going to sound pretty radical. I know some of you probably said, ‘I don’t know how to teach my kid trigonometry’. But you know what? You can teach your kids, sex ed. I’m not sure we need to have that in the public school system. I would recommend that we remove that.
Hudson: I’m actually the radical one here, because we have 539 school districts in the state of Michigan. I actually propose we cut that down to 83, with one county school district for all the schools in that county. … No more indoctrinating kids. Your son can stay your son. Your daughter can stay your daughter. And if you have a furry, they can stay home. We don’t allow pets in public schools.
Leonard:  Let me be clear here, we cannot expect any teacher with a classroom of 30 students to make certain that they’re all reading at a proficient level. They need help, targeted support. … I believe Michigan ought to have the highest paid teachers in the entire country. But you know what? It should be based on merit, not just because they’re there another year. Pay the good ones well, get rid of the bad ones.
Nesbitt: Governor Gretchen Whitmer has made it tough for our kids to make it here in Michigan, and believe me, Jocelyn Benson ain’t going to make it any better. She’s going to be worse. I’m going to stand with President Trump, on day one, as your next governor, to make sure all kids have a choice, all parents have a choice, because we have to be able to trust parents.

Would you deploy the Michigan National Guard to the southern border if asked by Trump?
Cox: I would do so if asked by the president. … A lot of people ask me today about whether I would accept the help of Donald Trump to fight crime in Detroit and other cities. And the answer is absolutely.
Wagner: We have a northern border where we have crack going through there. So, I think at the president’s order … to send people there because they needed the extra help or relief for a short term, I could see doing that. But I think I’d like to keep my National Guard in here, in Michigan, as much as I can.
Rebandt: I certainly would. I completely support his policies. … I would obviously give some thought to some things that he might ask, but that is one that I would do because I am a part of a 50 state country and they need our help over there. But I have to say that we are a border state, and we certainly want to protect our own people here.
Hudson: If the president thought it was necessary to ask me, the governor of Michigan, for our National Guard troops, I would send them. Hell, I would even authorize them to go to Dearborn so we can protect the people of Dearborn from Sharia law [and] all the crap happening today.
Leonard: We don’t need to. The president did what he had to do, he came in the first couple months and he secured the southern border. … I certainly would accept the President’s help. I would accept National Guard troops coming here, as long as Detroit’s one of the most dangerous cities in the country and as long as we have a crime problem, I would certainly accept that, but we’ve got to keep our resources here.
Nesbitt: President Trump will have a partner with Aric Nesbitt as governor. Period. Paragraph. … I’m going to join with him to ban sanctuary cities here in the state of Michigan, and make sure that our cities and our country is safe again.

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-10-30 14:23:09+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,The amount of fentanyl seized in Pennsylvania this year set to surpass last year’s figures,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/the-amount-of-fentanyl-seized-in-pennsylvania-this-year-set-to-surpass-last-years-figures/,"Fentanyl has replaced heroin as the opioid most commonly found in Pennsylvania, state Attorney General Dave Sunday said.","Then-York County District Attorney Dave Sunday, candidate for attorney general, answers questions at a candidates forum in Pittsburgh Oct. 23, 2024 (Photo by Abigail Hakas for the Capital-Star)Standing alongside various law enforcement officials, Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday announced that as of the beginning of September, the state had seized over 50 million doses of fentanyl.
“With each passing year, fentanyl continues to be pervasive in opioid seizures,” Sunday said during a press conference in Philadelphia on Wednesday. “And in 2025, we have reached a high watermark with regard to the work we’ve done.”
For perspective, Pennsylvania seized 50 million doses during all of 2024.
Sunday credited the collaboration of his office with county district attorneys and law enforcement departments, coupled with federal partners, for the success.
“Any one of those 50 million doses could have killed someone,” Sunday said.
“I’ve been at this for 39 years, this is the best coordination and collaboration I’ve seen in a long, long time,” said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel.

Although just over half of the fentanyl confiscated in Pennsylvania so far was from Philadelphia and its collar counties, Bethel emphasized that it is not a neighborhood problem specific to areas like Kensington or the city.
“This is a commonwealth problem. It’s an American problem,” Bethel said. “Fentanyl does not care about the borders. It doesn’t care about what zip code you come from. It doesn’t care what politics you’re involved in, it is ending lives, and we’re seeing that on a daily basis.”
Sunday, holding up a small packet, explained that two milligrams is all it takes for a potential lethal dose of fentanyl.
“This is all it takes to end a life, to end the hopes and dreams of a human being, to absolutely devastate a family and circle of friends, causing lifelong pain and suffering,” Sunday said.
Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said his brother died at the age of 50 due to a drug overdose.
“The fentanyl crisis in this country is literally the worst narcotics epidemic this country has ever faced, upwards of 70,000 people die every single year because of fentanyl,” Stollsteimer said.
“This is such a powerful narcotic, it cannot be in the streets anymore,” he added.
Bethel detailed what makes fentanyl different from heroin, explaining it was also a powder. Heroin spoils, he said, but the powder for fentanyl does not and it can be mixed with other narcotics.
“So easy to make, so easy to move, so many ways to move it,” Bethel said. “It is probably one of the greatest challenges we’ve seen in my lifetime, as it relates to fentanyl, what it can do and how it’s being used and how it’s being moved through.”
Sunday also said the heroin seized by law enforcement isn’t always in small packets, but at times it’s packaged in bulk and oftentimes includes fentanyl pills, which are disguised to look similar to other prescriptions. The state has seized more than 76,000 fentanyl pills so far this year, he said.

Fentanyl has replaced heroin as the opioid most commonly found in Pennsylvania.
“And it’s not even close,” Sunday said.
He also described the flow of fentanyl coming into the commonwealth as “non-stop” due to how easy it is to traffic and transport. When responding to a reporter’s question, Sunday said it’s about $10 a dose.
Last week, a drug bust in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia made national headlines after 33 members of a drug trafficking organization were charged in a 41-count indictment.
Treatment for those affected by drug addiction, was also highlighted as a key in addressing the issue.
Although touting the milestone reached so far in 2025, various officials on Wednesday also offered warnings to those who continue to traffick fentanyl.
“I think it’s been stated very clearly here…the pressure is going to continue to increase,” Bethel said. “We will not stop. As the Attorney General said, your time will come, and we are going to work collaboratively to do that.”
“All of us up here either know a friend or a family member who has been impacted by the powerful and addictive nature of opioids and fentanyl,” Abington Police Chief Patrick Molloy said. “We also know that we cannot arrest our way out of this crisis.”
“However, by aggressively prosecuting these bad guys and providing resources for people to get help, there’s no doubt that we will continue to keep our foot on the gas and continue to save lives in our communities,” Molloy added.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DaveSunday1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 10:57:11.480101

At a recent Senate hearing, and again at a press conference announcing the legislation this week, parents of kids who died by suicide said the chatbots were exposing their children to sexual and suicide-related content.
Maria Raine lost her 16-year-old son, Adam, to suicide in April. She blames ChatGPT.
“My son, Adam, ended his life in April after ChatGPT coached him to suicide over the course of months. I’m here today with my husband Matt to support this critical legislation,” Raine said. “It was only after Adam died that we learned what Chat GPT had done to him, and now we know that OpenAI twice downgraded its safety guardrails in the months leading up to my son’s death, which we believe they did to keep people talking to Chat GPT.
“If it weren’t for their choice to change a few lines of code, Adam would be alive today,” Raine said.
The GUARD Act would require age verification for users. It would also require a disclosure that explicitly told users the conversation they’re having is not with a human.
“1/3 of children today report having deep, intimate relationships with these chatbots,” Murphy said. “These stories that you’re hearing of children taking their lives or engaging in life-altering self-harm, this is not the exception. This is becoming a norm, and if we don’t do something, it is going to get worse.”
The GUARD Act was introduced by Blumenthal and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO). It’s co-sponsored by Murphy and Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL).
When asked why Congress hasn’t acted on the issue yet, Hawley blamed the technology lobby.
“They’re the most powerful companies on this hill,” Hawley said. “They spend like nobody’s business. And I’ve said before, joking, but really it’s more ruefully, there ought to be a sign outside of the Senate chamber that says, ‘bought and paid for by big tech.’”
One tech industry trade group accused the bill of being too heavy-handed, raising privacy concerns.
“We all want to keep kids safe, but the answer is balance, not bans,” Chamber of Progress K.J. Bagchi with the Chamber of Progress said. “It’s better to focus on transparency when kids chat with AI, curbs on manipulative design, and reporting when sensitive issues arise.”
The legislation comes as Blumenthal continues to push for passage of his Kids Online Safety Act. That bill, which would impose a duty of care on social media sites and require companies to allow users to opt out of algorithms, passed the Senate with an overwhelming majority. It did not get called for a vote in the House.
KOSA critics have raised concerns over potential censorship.

Dr. Camelia Lawrence of Shelton said she last spoke with her family Tuesday when the storm hit. She has since been unable to make contact with anyone.
“It’s a lot of anxiety at this moment, because I do have a lot of family that’s on the island, and as of yesterday, at about 2 p.m. shortly after landfall, I’ve lost all communications with family and friends,” Lawrence said.
The breakdown in communication also impacts people on the island, according to Lawrence. She’s now working with advocacy and aid organizations for much needed help.
“Trees are down, power lines are down,” Lawrence said. “Communities are completely isolated, and so there will be coordinated effort to just get food. So we’re collecting a lot of non-perishable items.”
Lawrence is working with the Jamaican American Connection based in New Haven as well as the American Friends of Jamaica, which have both launched fundraisers for relief efforts. Lawrence said the community is resilient.
For others like Hamden resident Nadine Barnett Cosby, that sense of community can take on different forms.
Cosby, who is dean of the School of Communications at Quinnipiac University, said most of her connections to the Jamaican American community are in New York, and she hasn’t made many connections in Connecticut.
But she doesn’t feel alone in a time like this.
“I actually have had friends from really all over the country and parts of the world texting me calling just to check in and ask me if my family is OK,” Cosby said. “And I think even without having that Jamaican network in my immediate vicinity in Connecticut, it really is heartwarming to know that I have such a vast support system.”

(Photo courtesy Gov. Wes Moore's office)Wednesday was a busy day for the European Union’s ambassador to the U.S.
Besides attending the Circular Economy Forum in Annapolis, an event focused on reuse and recycling, Ambassador Jovita Neliupšienė’s also had a chance to meet Gov. Wes Moore for what she described as an “all of the above” chat: Moore’s military service, the Maryland National Guard’s longtime partnership with Estonia, European goods moving through the Port of Baltimore and Maryland’s sustainability work.
“It was a really fruitful dialogue,” Neliupšienė said. “And I hope to continue it, because the next stop is the Army-Navy game.”
Moore and Neliupšienė co-hosted the opening session of the closed-door forum, which convened policymakers and experts from both sides of the Atlantic to discuss ways to reduce waste, including designing items for reuse and expanding recycling.
In May, Moore signed a new law that will require producers of packaging and paper products sold in the state, with some exceptions, to submit producer responsibility plans starting in 2028. The documents will detail companies’ plans for reducing packaging waste.
“Maryland is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our European partners in shaping a future where our work to grow the economy and protect our environment go hand in hand,” Moore said in a statement.
Annapolis is the first stop for the forum, but will not be the last, said Neliupšienė, a Lithuanian native who was named ambassador to the United States in January 2024. Wednesday’s forum was sponsored by the Delegation of the European Union to the United States, Maryland and the city of Annapolis.

In Maryland, Neliupšienė said she sees a willingness to participate in sustainability initiatives, in part because it is “so much exposed to the water.”
“You have the Chesapeake Bay and in general, the ocean, at your backyard. It’s not next door. It’s actually in your backyard,” she said. “So, for example, the initiative on more sustainable packaging is extremely important to protect your ocean and your nature. So there are elements which actually are happening on the state level.”
Neliupšienė noted that President Donald Trump’s (R) return to office has changed the game when it comes to diplomatic topics, including trade, security and energy. But her focus remains on building cooperation between the U.S. and the EU, no matter the talking points of the administration in Washington.
“Energy dominance is the topic here in the United States,” Neliupšienė said. “Liquefying gas is actually European. So what I’m trying to say is, actually, that it’s so extremely important to work together.”
Trump has wielded tariffs to pressure on trading partners, including the EU. POLITICO reporting earlier this month indicated that the White House was pressuring the EU in tariff negotiations to drop climate change-related regulations for American businesses, but EU representatives have pushed back. Neliupšienė said the EU has also developed a green industrial plan, “which actually focuses not only on the environment, but how we can help business to deliver on that.”
“We stick to our principles: That we really have to move our economy and our way of life to be more sustainable,” she said.
But Neliupšienė’s focus remains maintaining stability in the U.S.-EU relationship.
“For 80 years, we have been the closest partners you can find globally, and it should remain so, because our supply chains are so much intertwined,” Neliupšienė said. “It’s very difficult to untangle. And to make sure that we have a predictable relations is the key.”
‘An amazing state’s attorney’
Turns out Prince George’s County’s circuit court judges aren’t the only fans of interim County State’s Attorney Tara Jackson.
The judges tapped Jackson, then the acting county executive, to become state’s attorney when Aisha Braveboy left in June after being elected county executive. Now, Jackson is seeking the job permanently, and her first fundraiser for her 2026 campaign Wednesday was packed with people singing her praises, with dozens putting on stickers attesting to her accomplishments, accolades and achievements in more than two decades of public and private legal practice.

One of those supporters who turned out at the Homewood Suites by Hilton in Largo was former County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D), who worked with Jackson when she was a deputy county attorney in the Office of Law. The one aspect Baker said Jackson would provide for his family: safety.
“I want to know somebody’s looking out for justice, and that is important,” Baker said in a brief interview. “I’ve seen her work. Her integrity. She does what she says she’s going to do. She’s going to be an amazing state’s attorney.”
Besides Baker, other high-profile attendees who cheered on Jackson included retired Prince George’s County Circuit Judge Sheila Tillerson Adams and her husband, Bowie Mayor Tim Adams; Maryland State Board of Education Vice President Monica Goldson, who was CEO of the county’s public schools; and Elizabeth Hewlett, former head of the bi-county Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission and chair of the county’s planning board.
Part of Jackson’s future plans would be to ensure the state’s attorney’s office collaborates with county government, the public school system and community organizations, especially when it comes to helping youth. But Jackson said her office will still hold youth accountable for their actions.
“We cannot continue to make excuses for the deviant behavior of our young people without teaching our young people that actions do have consequences,” she said. “I have said and will continue to say that accountability is loving. I’m very clear that in many instances, discipline will save a child’s life.”
Jackson stressed that that repeat violent and gun offenders, and those who exploit children will face “serious time.” The state’s attorney’s office, she said, will also provide alternative programs for nonviolent offenders instead of incarceration.
“I firmly believe that accountability is the difference between calm and chaos,” Jackson said.
Some of the most rousing remarks came from Artis Hampshire-Cowan, the first person appointed in December 2023 to represent the county on the Maryland Stadium Authority board. Hampshire-Cowan said she wanted Jackson to run for state’s attorney when current U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D) ran for county executive in 2018.
“What we need to tell everybody in Prince George’s County, look at the credentials. That’s the most important thing,” Hampshire-Cowan said. “I’m working night and day, and I’m not going to stop until she gets elected.”

Gov. Wes Moore this week appointed Ralph Laurence Sapia and Evelyn Lombardo Cusson to the Baltimore County Circuit Court and Brett Joann Engler to the Frederick County District Court.
In a statement announcing the appointments Monday, Moore said “Ralph Laurence Sapia, Evelyn Lombardo Cusson, and Brett Joann Engler have demonstrated a commitment to fairness and justice that will serve our people well.” According to the governor’s office:

Sapia is a solo practitioner in Towson, who was a partner at Tillman Sapia, P.A., before opening his own firm. He has taught history and social studies in Baltimore County Public Schools, where he currently serves on the ethics review panel. He is also chair of the St. Agnes Hospital Foundation board of directors, and is a founding member of the Sisters Academy of Baltimore board of directors. Sapia received his law degree from the University of Baltimore School of Law.
Cusson is an assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Maryland, where she has prosecuted white-collar crimes and handled a broad range of both civil and criminal cases. She is also the office’s elder justice coordinator, working to raise awareness of abuse, neglect and exploitation of older adults. She previously practiced at Gordon Feinblat and at Anderson, Coe & King, and clerked for Judge Lynne A. Battaglia on the Maryland Court of Appeals—now the Supreme Court of Maryland. Cusson, who earned her law degree from Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law, also serves as president of the Baltimore City Bar Association.
Engler is chief of the domestic violence unit in the Frederick County State’s Attorney’s Office. As assistant state’s attorney, Engler has worked for more than a decade to improve prosecution of domestic violence cases and strengthen collaboration between criminal justice and community stakeholders. She has helped advocate for several legal advances, including a 2020 Maryland law categorizing strangulation as a felony. Engler currently chairs the Frederick County Domestic Violence Coordinating Council and Frederick County Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team, in addition to serving on state and national committees related to domestic violence response.

Nuclear waste, atomic testing on tap for Nevada in Project 2025 manifesto

The U.S. conducted above-ground nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas from 1951 until 1962, according to a brief historical overview from the test site’s successor entity, the Nevada National Security Site.
Following signing of a test ban treaty in 1963, nuclear weapons testing moved underground at the Nevada site, with more than 800 underground weapons tests until the last one in 1992. Since then subcritical tests have been performed to maintain reliability of weapons without actually exploding them.
Along with calling for resuming work on a nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain, Project 2025, the document that has served as a blueprint for multiple Trump administration policies, outlined a plan to “restore the nuclear infrastructure” and to “restore readiness to test nuclear weapons at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS), formerly the Nevada Test Site, to ensure the ability of the U.S. to respond quickly to asymmetric technology surprises.”
Fred Dilger, executive director of the state’s Office for Nuclear Projects, told the Nevada’s Commission on Nuclear Projects prior to last year’s election that “I like to joke that Project 2025 should have been labeled Project 1995 because the ideas are all old and out of date as far as nuclear issues.”
Dilger added that a retired senior official from NNSS told him “they want nothing to do with full scale underground testing. There is no need for full-scale underground testing.”

Joe Lombardo, who endorsed Trump, told the Current last year that the governor does not support Project 2025’s advocacy for nuclear weapons testing in the state.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Exercise_Desert_Rock_I_Buster-Jangle_Dog_002.jpg,,,2025-10-30 09:58:11.417933

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, uses reports of fraud within veterans' disability claims as an opportunity to hold a hearing examining the efficiency of the U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee video)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, wants to get to the bottom of recent reports of fraud by veterans claiming benefits.
“We have an obligation to the men and women who have injuries or illnesses connected with their service in uniform to make certain they are provided the tools and resources they need to succeed in life after the military,” Moran said, convening a hearing Wednesday in Washington. “Our goal today is to examine the facts.” 
Moran, chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, called the hearing in response to a Washington Post investigation that showed the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has antiquated policies that sometimes provided outsized benefits for veterans with minor conditions. It also found cases where veterans lied about their conditions outright.
The investigation found, for example, that the Veterans Benefits Administration typically pays veterans with sleep apnea more than a veteran who had a leg amputated below the knee. Based on documents, videos and interviews, the pair of articles detailed instances of veterans falsifying disabilities to earn higher benefits.
But some lawmakers and officials at the hearing disputed the conclusions of the investigation. 
“There is no massive fraud going on,” said Cheryl Mason, the inspector general for Veterans Affairs.
Jeremy Villanueva, associate legislative director for Paralyzed Veterans of America, said it is “disgraceful when disabled veterans are portrayed as fraudsters and cheats.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Illinois, said the article painted veterans as “dishonest fraudsters,” “cheaters” and “moochers.”
She said no one denied the reality that there are a small number of fraudsters. She said investigative resources should be increased if the goal is to strengthen deterrence and prosecution.
“The mistake we must avoid is allowing a minority of criminals who dictate the redesign of the VA disability benefits system into a bureaucratic black box that is more frustrating and less fair and will leave more veterans waiting and dying waiting to get benefits they’ve earned,” said Duckworth, who is an Army National Guard veteran.
Moran said the articles left the impression that veterans are responsible for widespread fraud.
“The cases of fraud highlighted in these articles do not reflect the reality of who veterans are, the vast majority of the veteran population or the values veterans embody,” Moran said.
The attention the stories received provided the committee with the opportunity to discuss the efficacy of the VA disability claims process, Moran said.
“Is the system ensuring timely, accurate and fair outcomes?” he asked. “Is it empowering veterans to thrive or inadvertently creating barriers to their success and opportunities after service?”
He said he sought to bring different points of view to the committee, inviting six people whose jobs and lives are intertwined with the Veterans Administration. Moran said he had faith in the committee’s ability to hear from veterans and ensure they receive the benefits they are entitled to.
Of Kansas’ 182,000 veterans, more than 83,000 are enrolled in the VA health care system and more than 47,500 receive disability benefits, according to department data from fiscal year 2023.
The Post wasn’t subtle in its examples of fraud, said U.S. Sen. Jim Banks, R-Indiana, citing a veteran who pretended to be blind for almost three decades and a competitive bodybuilder who faked trouble walking and wore a diaper. Banks, who is a Navy veteran, asked Daniel Gade, a retired U.S. Army Colonel and a source in a Post article, how prevalent outright disability compensation fraud really is.
It is rare, Gade said.
“A bigger problem is the problem of lax oversight and easily exaggerated conditions and no follow-up,” said Gade.
Mason agreed that fraud is rare, acknowledging bad actors exist, but they are few compared to the 6.9 million American veterans who receive benefits.
Despite the rarity of fraud and steps to improve the veterans’ disability benefits program, the VA has failed to modernize, said Elizabeth Curda, the director of education, workforce and income security issues for the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
It is a large, decentralized organization and change often faces strong headwinds, Curda said. The VA relies on outdated ratings to determine disability levels, and it is 10 years behind on its goal to bring policies and procedures up to date, she said.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, repeatedly pointed to substantial cuts to the VA workforce. He said the system has been dismantled through “reckless policies” that have pushed civil servants to the brink of their abilities. He cited Trump administration policies such as “arbitrary” contract cancellations, return to office mandates and proposed lay-offs.
There are simply not enough people, Blumenthal said.

Some of those findings date back to 2008. (File Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Maryland secretary of Human Resources repeatedly insisted to lawmakers Wednesday that he and his staff are working to transform an agency that was the subject of a scathing audit and responsible for the care of a teen who died while in foster care living in a Baltimore City hotel.
A 70-page report issued by the Office of Legislative Audits identified more than a dozen issues, many repeat findings with some dating back to 2008. Among them, findings included failure to ensure adults with criminal backgrounds didn’t have access to children and that seven registered sex offenders were found living in homes with children under court-approved guardianships.
Secretary Rafael Lopez told lawmakers that many of the problems in the agency were inherited.
“Let’s be real clear, we largely agree with the audit’s findings and no matter where and how the problem started, we own our responsibility to deliver solutions, and we’ll partner with you to lead this transformation, because that’s what Marylanders deserve,” Lopez said. “The safety and well-being of Maryland’s children have been our highest priorities.”
Lopez recounted a list of policy changes made to address some problems, including standardizing criminal background checks, standardizing contracts for one-on-one providers and ending the practice of placing some children in foster care in hotels.
But Lopez and his staff disagreed with audit findings that said the agency had the ability to do background checks on adults living with children in court-approved guardianships.
State may have put children in homes where registered sex offenders lived

“As of right now, we do not believe that we have the statutory authority that you are citing right now,” Lopez said, adding that he would work with lawmakers to find a way “in which to do that constitutionally.”
Some members of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee disagreed with Lopez’s assertions that court-approved guardianship curtails the agency’s ability to do background checks.
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel County) said after the meeting that Lopez’s testimony felt lacking.
“These are difficult and complex issues,” Lam said. “The really frustrating thing is that they could have figured all this out earlier.”
Lam said he expects some legislation in the 2026 session, which may or may not include a workgroup to look at fixes for tougher issues.
Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen told lawmakers his staff believes state statutes and regulations give the agency the legal authority to do checks. But he added that department staffers need to approach the issue thinking as if they were parents protecting their own children.
“So, there’s probably room in between to fill in some of the gaps, in particular related to their response to the guardianship homes,” Tanen said. “We certify the guardianship home. We take the children, we place them there … we have a responsibility to make sure that we’re putting the children in a home that is safe, not on the one day that we walk them across the threshold.”
Tanen said the agency should “look at that and say, ‘If it was my child, what would I want before I put them in this home?'”
The three-hour committee hearing was punctuated by moments of frustration from some lawmakers.
Del. Steven J. Arentz (R-Upper Shore) said agency responses to audits far too often feel like “what I could have wrote.”
“We get a little bit of a list … ‘Here’s what we’re going to do,’ and ‘We’re going to fix this problem,” Arentz said. “Four years later, with a history — not your history necessarily but a history — we’re repeating them [the findings] when you knew about them coming in and they’ve not been addressed.”
Webster Ye, Lopez’s chief of staff, acknowledged the agency is “on the equivalent of academic probation” because of the audit and its repeat findings. He said the agency is “moving forward so that we are positioned in the next couple of years to eliminate that repeat finding and to change our departmental culture so that it doesn’t happen again.”

Some on the committee did not seem swayed, and suggested legislation might be needed to bring reforms. The committee is awaiting a “deeper dive” review by the Department of Legislative Services Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability.
“It’s great to identify problems. That’s how I make my living,” Tanen said. “Fixing the problem requires people who are specialized and focused in the areas that we’re identifying, and that’s where we’re running into the problem. And I keep saying, they don’t need more audits. We’re auditing the information. There’s nothing changing.”
Tanen said there is growing frustration over the repeat findings in audits of the department. But he said the agency, absent additional legislation, can address many of the issues it faces.
“There’s 14 findings, a lot of repeats. It’s unsatisfactory, but there’s not a lot of disagreement. And for the most part, they’re saying, we’re working on this, and they put in some effort.”
The latest audit found that the department may have approved guardianship homes for children in state care where registered sex offenders lived, and that it failed to identify a convicted sex offender who worked in a group foster home and later faced criminal charges involving children under his care.
Five days after the audit was released, the body of Kanaiyah Ward, 16, was found Sept. 22 in a room at a Residence Inn by Marriott. The teen, who was in state care, had been living in the hotel on N. Wolfe Street in Baltimore.
An autopsy concluded that she died as the result of an overdose of diphenhydramine, an over-the-counter allergy medication.
“The vast majority of the findings in here … their governance already allows them to go and address the process,” Tanen said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_2340-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-30 09:58:11.417933

(Photos by Parker Michels-Boyce and Mechelle Hankerson for the Virginia Mercury)With less than a week to go before Election Day, Democrat Abigail Spanberger holds a commanding 10-point lead over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s race for governor, according to a new Roanoke College poll.
The survey, conducted Oct. 22–27 by the college’s Institute for Policy and Opinion Research (IPOR), found Spanberger ahead 51% to 41% among likely voters — a 3-point increase from the previous poll in August. Just 4% remain undecided and 1% support someone else. The poll of 1,041 likely voters carries a margin of error of 4.05%.
In down-ballot contests, Democratic Sen. Ghazala Hashmi leads Republican John Reid 42% to 40% in the lieutenant governor’s race, while Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares holds an 8-point edge, 46% to 38%, over Democratic challenger Jay Jones.
 Enthusiasm and key issues

Two-thirds of likely voters (67%) said they are very enthusiastic about casting a ballot, and another 23% described themselves as somewhat enthusiastic. 
When asked to name the most important issue, 29% cited threats to democracy and 24% listed inflation. Immigration ranked third at 12%, followed by taxes (5%), abortion (5%), and crime (5%).
President Donald Trump’s job approval remains unchanged at 40% since the August Roanoke College Poll. Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s approval holds steady at 50%, but his disapproval rating has dropped seven points.
Spanberger’s favorability rose to 47%, with 42% viewing her unfavorably — both figures higher than in August. Earle-Sears’ ratings also climbed to 38% favorable and 45% unfavorable.
 Jones text controversy

The poll found that 80% of likely voters have heard or read about 2022 text messages in which Democratic attorney general nominee  Jones fantasized about shooting then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah.
Among those who said they already voted for Jones, 87% said they would have supported him anyway, while 1% said they would have switched their vote to Miyares. Another 5% said they would not have voted in that race, and 8% declined to answer.
“Like most elections, this one will be determined by voter turnout and how independents vote,” said Harry Wilson, interim director of IPOR and professor emeritus of political science at Roanoke College. 
“While Spanberger appears to have maximized her Democratic support, Earle-Sears could slightly increase her support among Republicans, and she needs to make more inroads with independents with very little time left to do so.”
Wilson added that “the races for lieutenant governor and attorney general are both within the poll’s margin of error, though the latter just barely so. Reid has done well to solidify his partisan support but needs a little help from independents, while Hashmi could do better with her partisans.”
While Jones has “clearly lost some support among Democrats, they have not moved over to support Miyares,” Wilson continued. 
“As concerning for Jones, Miyares now narrowly leads among independents. It may be unprecedented to see such a divergence between the race for governor and attorney general. Everyone who ever contemplates running for public office might consider holding their tongue and stilling their hands on occasion.”

Wes Moore at the Sept. 10, 2025, meeting of the Board of Public Works. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) joined state lawmakers Wednesday pushing for state action to make up for federal food assistance that may run dry beginning this weekend.
Lierman joined lawmakers, both Democratic and Republican, who believe that the state should step in and cover lost Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits while the federal government is shut down and the U.S. Department of Agriculture is refusing to release funds for the program
During a virtual meeting with lawmakers Wednesday, Lierman said she hopes “that our state will act to extend SNAP benefits for the month of November,” because a disruption in the federally funded food assistance program would have ripple effects on Maryland’s economy.
“Because of its immediate impact on our most vulnerable residents, on businesses that are just scraping by, on some of our most historically challenged communities, and recognizing the cascading impact of these cuts on Maryland’s economy,” she said, “I do hope that our state will act to extend SNAP benefits for the month of November. And I certainly hope, through legal action, we can recoup that funding.”
More than 680,000 Marylanders who currently receive SNAP benefits are expected to lose those food assistance dollars over the month of November. They are among 41 million SNAP recipients nationwide who would be affected.
In previous shutdowns, the federal government would continue to pay for SNAP out of USDA contingency funds, to ensure that low-income families and other struggling households could continue to afford food.
State officials, advocates brace for SNAP dollars ending for 680,000 Marylanders

But after funding benefits when the government was shut down in October, the Trump administration reversed course and announced last week that it is unable to continue funding SNAP next month, unless Congress agrees on a budget — and it may not reimburse states that decide to fill the gap in the meantime.
More than two dozen states, including Maryland, this week sued the Trump administration in hopes of forcing the government to pay for SNAP amid the shutdown.  In the meantime, a handful of governors in other states have signaled they will use state funds to cover SNAP regardless.
Maryland’s top budget lawmakers believe that Gov. Wes Moore (D) should do the same, by tapping into the state’s Rainy Day fund that is projected to close fiscal 2026 with a balance of $2.25 billion, according to state analysts.
House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) thinks that “680,000 people losing their benefits is an emergency” and that state officials have good reason to use the Rainy Day fund.
“I want to be crystal clear, this committee, this House … believes that we should extend this benefit on a monthly basis – for the month of November and potentially through December,” Barnes said Wednesday. “I think you don’t have to have been poor to know that going hungry creates real hardship. And being poor through the holidays and not having a meal on Thanksgiving creates lasting trauma, particularly for children.”
Senate Budget and Taxation Vice Chair Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) agreed.
“I’m a hawk on protecting the Rainy Day fund,” Rosapepe said. “This clearly is a five-star hurricane for poor people who need food, so I’m totally on board.”
State data shows that in August, $123.2 million in SNAP benefits were distributed to 371,522 households in Maryland, helping 668,162 people afford food that month.
Based on the August figures, analysts with the Department of Legislative Services say that covering SNAP benefits for both November and December would require around $250 million.

Del. Jefferson L. Ghrist (R-Upper Shore) supports using state funds to cover a lapse in SNAP coverage, even if he places the blame of the shutdown on Democrats in Congress.
“As a fiscal conservative, the Rainy Day fund should be used for just that. It should be used to deal with an emergency situation – here we are,” he said. “These are oftentimes single working moms, folks with developmental disabilities. These are folks who are senior citizens that can’t help themselves.
“I hope the Moore administration hears us clearly – that this is a bipartisan effort to make sure that these folks are taken care of, at least temporarily,” Ghrist said.
It’s not just Ghrist. House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) says the “ball is in the Moore Administration’s court.”
“Republicans want to see children, families, seniors, and the disabled who truly deserve these safety net benefits receive them without interruption,” Buckel said in a written statement. “There certainly are sufficient reserves available to Governor Moore to pay some level of SNAP benefits for a period of time until the bickering politicians in DC can straighten themselves out and get the federal government running again reasonably, just as Governor Youngkin has done in Virginia.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) has so far offered few details on how he plans to address the potential loss of benefits, saying the state is committed to doing what it can to pick up lost federal benefits, but also warning that no state has the ability to fully cover federal programs.
Not only does SNAP help struggling families put food on the table, Lierman said it is one of the “highest short-term economic multipliers,” meaning that every SNAP dollar spent generates additional economic activity as it moves through grocery stores, food retailers and the community.
“I should add that the economic activity from SNAP generates approximately $289 million in state tax revenue,” Lierman told lawmakers. She added that small grocery stores and food retailers will lose significant business if SNAP recipients are not buying food with their benefits.
David Romans, a Department of Legislative Services budget analyst, said that the “simplest” option for the state to fill in SNAP dollars would be for Moore to declare a state of emergency and tap into the Rainy Day funds.
But the administration appears hesitant. Acting Budget Secretary Jake Weissmann agreed Wednesday that the state has the funds to backfill SNAP funding, but said the “conversations we’re having within the Moore-Miller administration are broader than SNAP.”
Shutdown double whammy: SNAP food benefits ending and federal workers go unpaid

“I want to provide you with a larger picture,” Weissmann told lawmakers. “We are in month 10 of a four-year term, and we are going to continue to face these challenges for the next three years.
“The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, is close to running out,” Weissmann said. “There are growing questions about Headstart and there are real, valid concerns whether this [Trump] administration threatens Medicaid funding sometime in the near future. We’re also facing over a $1 billion shortfall next year.
“That’s why this administration is taking a week-by-week approach to this,” he said. “With all the outstanding questions, we have to move carefully to protect Marylanders.”
Weissman said that the administration would have more to share “in the next 24 hours.” Barnes questioned the delay and the lack of direct information from Weissmann and Moore.
“You know the comments here today are woefully inadequate and we’re not really getting much information – but I guess we’ll stay tuned for the next 24 hours,” Barnes said.
Moore is scheduled to hold a news conference Thursday to “announce executive action” regarding SNAP and programs affected by the government shutdown.
Earlier Wednesday, reporters asked Moore to clarify how he’ll handle the missing SNAP funds if they run out this weekend. He stuck to his position that federal dollars should fund the benefit while the government is shut down. But he did not answer whether he will tap state funds to cover SNAP.
“We’re going to make sure our people are taken care of and we’re going to be creative, we’re going to work with the private sector, we’re going to work with the nonprofits sector,” he said. “There is no state that can simply say, ‘Oh yes, despite the fact that the federal government is breaking the law, that we’ll just cover down on a quarter of a billion dollars every single month that the federal government is supposed to be providing.’”

Bill Driscoll, who represents the town of Randolph, from trying to secure its Gateway City status. He has introduced legislation that would revise the eligibility criteria of a Gateway – something previously attempted but never done successfully on Beacon Hill since the Legislature codified the d[...]","IN 2017, the town of Randolph met two of the three criteria set in state law to qualify as a Gateway City, a designation that comes with state funding opportunities. The community was just shy of the population requirement but had a median household income below the Commonwealth’s average and a rate of educational attainment of a bachelor’s degree that was also below the state average. 
The 2020 US Census provided hope that a few hundred new residents would be counted so the city might reach the population minimum. But the results came back showing Randolph was just 16 people short of the required 35,000.  
The town appealed to the US Census Bureau, making the case that some properties were not counted properly. But it was futile, not only because Randolph’s population dwindled further after the pandemic, but also because its median income later rose slightly above the state average.  
But census counts and income thresholds haven’t stopped state Sen. Bill Driscoll, who represents the town, from trying to secure its Gateway status. Now, he has introduced legislation that would revise the eligibility criteria of a Gateway City – something previously attempted but never done successfully on Beacon Hill since the Legislature officially codified the designation in state law in 2009.  
“We’re on all the same types of lists in terms of educational issues, public health issues – but we are not a Gateway City technically,” Driscoll said of Randolph. “I think it’s worth talking about.”

Gateway Cities are midsize urban centers that anchor regional economies around Massachusetts. Collectively, these communities have shared economic struggles, and many suffered from the decline of manufacturing in the decades since World War II. They are also home to 40 percent of the state’s foreign-born residents.   
The term “Gateway City” was first coined in a 2007 report by MassINC, the nonprofit civic organization that also publishes CommonWealth Beacon, and originally described just 11 cities outside of Greater Boston that were, and still are, struggling regional economic centers. 
In 2009, lawmakers adopted the designation and defined Gateway Cities as any city with a population greater than 35,000 but less than 250,000, a median household income below the statewide average, and a rate of educational attainment of a bachelor’s degree or higher that is below the state average. This expanded the list to include 15 additional cities, including ones just outside of Boston even though they do not anchor the regional economy. 
Today, there are 26 Gateway Cities, including places like Holyoke, New Bedford, and Lowell, that meet the criteria set by the Legislature. But as these former industrial cities have worked to revitalize their local economies and reinvent themselves over the last few decades, defining them has become more challenging. 
To the benefit of Randolph, Driscoll’s new bill would add two additional criteria – having a population that’s at least 40 percent people of color and having 15 percent or more of households that identify as speaking English less than “very well” – to the three that cities must currently meet. Municipalities meeting any three of the five categories would be considered a Gateway City, making them eligible for certain grants, tax credits, and state funding for economic and community development.  
Driscoll’s proposed bill would add eight new communities to the list, according to a CommonWealth Beacon analysis of data from the most recent five-year American Community Survey, which covers 2019 to 2023 and provides an up-to-date snapshot of population data across the state.  
Those communities are Randolph, Weymouth, Southbridge, Framingham, Marlborough, Milford, Tisbury (a town of less than 5,000 on the island of Martha’s Vineyard), and perhaps most controversial of all, Boston. The largest city in New England would qualify as a Gateway under the proposed legislation – meeting the minority population, median household income, and English-speaking requisites. 
Driscoll said Gateway City status should be given to communities with those trying to make their start in Massachusetts – regardless of the minimum population – and the two additional criteria help to capture that.  
“I want to make sure that we’re capturing the essence of what this designation means,” Driscoll said. “Starting a life here, starting a business here, a population that is newer to Massachusetts – trying to support them in a way that I think fits with the spirit of the original law.”  
Driscoll added that he’s not yet committed to what exactly the five new criteria should be, and there needs to be further discussion with the communities that could qualify so the Legislature can cast “the appropriate size net.” But he hopes his bill can revive the conversation on Beacon Hill.  
“There’s at least a handful of communities that I think should be eligible for this type of funding,” Driscoll said. “My intention is to cast a wider net.” 
Ben Forman, research director at the MassINC Policy Center, said they never intended Gateway Cities to be based on a deficit formula, and the designation was meant to be given to centers of economic activity. 
“Our whole argument for strategically focusing on these places was because they have important assets to the state. You don’t graduate from that. If you’re a regional economic center, you should hopefully remain a regional economic center,” he said. “The whole point of this was to draw investment to regional economies outside of Boston.”

There are two current Gateway Cities – Salem and Methuen – that do not qualify for the status under the state’s current criteria. Methuen’s median household income has just surpassed the state average. The most recent ACS data shows that nearly 50 percent of Salem residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher, a bit more than the statewide average.  
Under Drsicoll’s bill, Methuen would still meet three of the new five criteria, but Salem would not. 
There is no mechanism in state law to regularly review each city’s eligibility to ensure they meet the three criteria. But Driscoll’s bill would not only allow the secretary of economic development to certify which municipalities qualify after each decennial census, but also give the office the ability to move a community on or off the list at any point mid-decade using annual estimates from the Census Bureau.  
The Legislature has on some occasions recognized “similarly situated communities” for certain grants or funding opportunities. These are municipalities that lack the population of a Gateway City but otherwise meet the state’s criteria.  
Driscoll believes adding two additional criteria will prevent communities like Methuen from toggling in and out of the status every year or two based on a strict set of three criteria, and will allow communities smaller than 35,000 that are still home to disadvantaged populations to benefit from the state funding.  
“I think that’s something we need to consider. Is 35,000 the right number? Or should we even have a floor?” Driscoll said. “Let’s continue to figure out what the right metrics are and how to how to modernize this.”
