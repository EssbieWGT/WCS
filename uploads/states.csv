Two reasons this is a terrible idea:

It is like returning to a world without money, a primitive barter economy.
Citizens and companies no longer buy and sell freely, but only when the government lets them.

On the first point, consider your household budget.  It is well balanced if your monthly income is close to your expenses.  If it’s not, the difference is savings or debt.  But it needn’t balance between any two parties.  I never bought anything from my employer, nor sold a thing to Stop & Shop.

James Stodder
But what if I had to barter my labor for everything?  If I worked in an old-time coal mine, I might “owe my soul to the company store.”
If instead, I bought groceries, gasoline, and housing from different companies, I’d have to figure out what to barter with each one.  That could get complicated. The volume of trade under barter is typically low – it’s hard to find a ‘match’ between would-be traders.  That’s why early civilizations invented money.
Similarly, if trade between every country has to ‘balance,’ even if only on an annual basis, we can expect the total volume of U.S. imports and exports to be much lower.  That would make us all poorer.
But it’s even worse than that, and here  we come to the second reason it’s a bad idea.  It’s one thing for a pair of individuals to keep trade balanced.  But how could we ensure that millions of individual trades between two countries balanced out at the end of every month or year?
Each government would have to tell “its own” companies when they could and couldn’t trade.  This is the opposite of a ‘free’ market, that Republican ideal.
It would be like the old Soviet Union, where I once studied.  At the end of the month, that economy fell into a kind of madness – shortages of the things people wanted most, but factories working extra shifts to make things few people wanted, just to meet their monthly quota.
Trump’s tariffs were not popular with the billionaires surrounding him.  They know they are bad for the economy – and their stock portfolios.   The New York Times reports that Musk lost $31 million in stocks right after Trump’s tariff announcement.
It is hard to feel too sorry for him.  The oligarchs’ libertarian commitment to free trade got put on hold when they kissed Trump’s ring.  But their ideas about why tariffs are bad were still correct, and they paid a price.  But the rest of us shouldn’t have to.
Trade wars also make real wars more likely.  People used to say China would never attack us.   “What would they do, bomb Walmart?”   They won’t have to worry about that now.  If we do get into a shooting war with China, Russia, and/or Iran, who’ll be on our side?   All those allies we just threatened?
If Trump puts back his tariffs on everyone, the U.S. will not remain “leader of the free world” for much longer.   We’ll be giving up much of our power – political, economic, even military.

That moment sparked a movement, one that gave us the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Environmental Protection Agency. It was a turning point.
Today, we face another. But this time, the stakes are even higher—and the threat is more urgent.
In 2025, the Trump administration is not just ignoring the climate crisis —it is actively undermining decades of progress. On day one, the administration re-withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, signaling a dangerous retreat from global climate cooperation. Since then, it has opened over half of the country’s protected forests to logging, reversed bans on toxic PFAS chemicals, and propped up polluting coal plants with executive orders —all while stripping back core environmental protections under the guise of “energy independence.”
One of the most alarming rollbacks is the elimination of the Clean Power Plan, which essentially opens the door to continued use of coal-fired power plants —the most polluting energy sources. At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency is moving to dismantle the Good Neighbor Plan, a vital policy under the Clean Air Act that helps prevent air pollution from drifting across state lines. This rollback has enormous consequences for Connecticut.
These decisions may feel far away from Connecticut, but their impacts land right here in our backyards. In August 2024, a few Connecticut towns faced deadly and historic rainfall and flooding. On August 18, peak rainfall amounts exceeded three inches of water per hour, and seven inches in three hours in a band from the Town of Monroe to the Town of Oxford. The estimated cost of damages from flooding in Oxford is around $20 million and over $10 million in Southbury.
More than any other eastern state, Connecticut has suffered from out-of-state air pollution, especially from upwind coal and industrial plants in the Midwest. The impacts of climate change are causing serious damage and costs to Connecticut communities. Just last summer, Connecticut farmers lost millions in crops after torrential floods wiped out growing fields —floods fueled by extreme weather patterns made worse by climate change. 
Coastal towns like Guilford, Fairfield, and Old Saybrook are contending with sea level rise and saltwater intrusion that threaten homes and infrastructure. Meanwhile, communities of color and low-income neighborhoods in cities like Bridgeport and Hartford are disproportionately exposed to dangerous heat and air pollution—conditions that will only worsen as the climate crisis accelerates.
This is Connecticut’s climate reality.
And yet, while the Trump administration rolls back environmental protections, Connecticut has a choice: we can follow them into failure —or we can fight forward.
Though the Connecticut General Assembly has failed to pass any meaningful climate legislation the past two years, this legislative session they have an opportunity to pass bills that will combat the dangerous and costly impacts of climate change. House Bill 5004, Senate Bill 9 and SJ 36 each contain key components needed to mitigate climate change impacts, increase climate  resilience, and establish long-term protection.
This Earth Day, we must say clearly and collectively: We cannot go back. Not on clean air. Not on safe water. Not on climate protection. Our state has the power and the responsibility to lead. That means protecting our most impacted and under-resourced communities. It means rejecting new fossil fuel infrastructure and holding polluters accountable. It means clean air, water, and healthy, renewable energy. 
We owe it to the farmers who are seeing their livelihoods washed away. To the children growing up with asthma in polluted neighborhoods. To the coastal families watching the water inch closer to their front doors. And to the next generation, who deserve a livable planet—not the burden of cleaning up our mess. 
Connecticut must lead where the Trump administration in Washington D.C. is failing. Let this Earth Day be one for bold state and local action. We cannot afford to wait. We cannot afford to move backward. And we will not let climate denial and corporate greed determine our future.

(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s state House and Senate are scheduled to meet at 2 p.m. Tuesday to vote on whether or not to override Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of a bill increasing the state’s per-student funding formula.
Multiple lawmakers have said that the Legislature likely lacks the votes for an override. Under the Alaska Constitution, the votes of 40 of the Legislature’s 60 members, meeting in joint session, are required to override the veto of a policy bill.
House Bill 69, which seeks to increase the base student allocation — core of Alaska’s per-pupil funding formula — passed the House and Senate by a combined vote of 32-25.
HB 69 proposes an increase of $1,000 to the BSA, or $253 million per year in total. 
Last year, legislators proposed a $680 increase to the BSA, and the related bill passed the House and Senate by a combined vote of 56-3. Legislators failed to override Dunleavy’s veto of that bill by a single vote.
Public education advocates say years of flat state funding has led to significant cuts to Alaska’s public schools, which have had to deal with inflation-driven cost increases.
The governor, and a decisive number of legislators who support him, say funding increases must be paired with policy changes intended to improve school performance.
Two years of negotiations have failed to result in a suite of policy changes that are acceptable to the governor and a majority of legislators. 
Without the formula change, the public-school funding level in the state’s annual operating budget will be decisive. 
The House has voted in favor of a budget that includes one-time bonus funding equivalent to a $1,000 BSA increase, but because the House’s budget also includes a significant deficit, the Senate may propose a smaller increase. 
The Senate’s draft budget has yet to emerge from the Senate Finance Committee.

CHICAGO — As prosecutors gave their closing arguments Monday in the trial of state Sen. Emil Jones III, they cast doubt on Jones’ testimony last week that red-light camera entrepreneur Omar Maani made him “uncomfortable” when he hinted at a bribe in the summer of 2019, asking the jury why — if that was true — did he keep meeting Maani for dinner and answering his calls and texts?

Maani, who’d been acting as an FBI cooperating witness for 1 ½ years by the time he and Jones kicked off what would eventually be a series of three dinners that summer, “littered” their meetings with words that should’ve been “screaming red flags,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany Ardam said.

She pointed to the times when Maani told Jones he wanted to get “creative” in how he’d pay a potential campaign contribution or otherwise “conceal” it from public reporting requirements — lest it look “goofy” or “funky” to either the media or other leaders inside his company, SafeSpeed.

“These words are giant red flags. These words should’ve had the defendant running for the hills,” Ardam said. “Instead, the defendant does the opposite.”

Jones, a Chicago Democrat, is accused of agreeing to accept $5,000 from Maani in exchange for changing legislation requiring a study of the red-light camera industry so it wouldn’t have any bearing on SafeSpeed’s extremely profitable business model. Jones also asked Maani to arrange for SafeSpeed to hire his former intern, which the feds allege was Jones furthering the bribe.

But in his closing arguments, Jones’ attorney Vic Henderson repeatedly emphasized that Maani never gave Jones the $5,000. He reminded the jury of the times during their secretly recorded dinners when Jones steered the conversation from the campaign contribution to the job for his intern. Jones last week testified that he was actively trying to avoid taking Maani’s money.

“Why would somebody on the take say, ‘Don’t give me any money?’” Henderson asked the jury. “Why would somebody who doesn’t know their calls are being listened to say, ‘Don’t give me any money?’ Why? Because he’s not on the take.”

But prosecutors argue it doesn’t matter that Maani never paid Jones, nor does it matter that the senator never amended his legislation in the way that Maani asked for.

“He doesn’t need to do it,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Prashant Kolluri told jurors during the government’s rebuttal arguments Monday afternoon. “The agreement is the crime.”

Henderson, though, reminded the jury that the only reason Jones was invited to multiple dinners with Maani was because the FBI directed it, accusing Maani of trying to “set him (Jones) up.” Since he began cooperating with the government in January 2018, Maani had secretly recorded “dozens and dozens and dozens” of others caught up in the feds’ public corruption probe.

The FBI also gave him $75,000, which he paid out in installments to then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, who’d been blocking Jones’ bill in Springfield as chair of the Senate Transportation committee. Maani handed over a stack of cash to Sandoval after Jones left a June 2019 dinner between the three, at which Sandoval had hinted at receiving benefits from Maani and told Jones that Maani “wants to be your friend.”

“If he was as dirty as they say he is, why not just give him an envelope of cash?” Henderson said of Jones. “Instead, what they did — your government, our government — they worked with Omar to get the senator to take a bribe. ...He doesn’t go to Omar; they send Omar to him.”

Maani, who admitted to the jury that he’d spent nearly his entire adult life paying bribes to get ahead in business, was eventually charged with one count of bribery in 2020 but after his three-year deferred prosecution agreement ended, the feds dropped the charge. Maani’s cooperation resulted in a handful of guilty pleas, including from Sandoval before he died in late 2020.

Henderson attempted to cast doubt on Maani’s testimony by bringing up his admission that he’d once forged one of his mother’s checks in service of a bribe.

“This is a guy who literally stole from his own mother,” he said. “Literally.”

Jury gets the case Monday afternoon

The jury was released to deliberate shortly after 2:30 p.m. and left the Dirksen Federal Courthouse about two hours later, having sent two notes to the judge asking for additional copies of transcripts for the secret recordings.

Jurors have already given the trial more time than the originally expected two-week timeframe, owing to both court delays and Jones’ surprise decision last week to testify in his own defense. He’s the first sitting state official in 20 years to do so.

But taking the witness stand opened Jones up to grueling cross-examination from Ardam, and both she and Kolluri on Monday accused the senator of lying in his testimony.

“When Mr. Jones was on the stand, he tried to have us believe that some pretty basic words in the English language don’t mean what we know they mean,” Kolluri said.

Kolluri pointed to Jones’ interpretation of when he relented to Maani’s insistence that he come up with a “goal” for him to give to the senator’s next upcoming fundraiser while the pair dined at a downtown Chicago steakhouse in July 2019.

“I don’t give folks numbers,” Jones said. “Just whatever you can raise for me, that’d be nice. I’m not greedy.”

But after Maani pressed him, Jones came up with $5,000.

“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” the senator said between bites of his meal.

Jones last week said that he meant Maani could give him anything “between zero and $5,000,” which Kolluri scoffed at Monday.

The prosecutor also expressed skepticism at Jones’ explanations of why he’d repeatedly said things like “I get it,” “I feel you,” “you’re good” and “yeah” when responding to the same suggestions from Maani he said made him uncomfortable. According to Jones, “It’s just how I speak.”

“I wasn’t agreeing with anything he said, I was just hearing him out,” Kolluri said sarcastically, paraphrasing Jones’ testimony.

Kolluri pointed to Maani’s and Jones’ Aug. 8, 2019, dinner during which Jones suggested that instead of a campaign contribution, Maani could instead sponsor a job fair in his district.

After Maani asked whether that would have to be reported on state campaign finance reports, Jones said no; Maani could instead pay for food or “giveaways” at the fair. On the witness stand last week, the senator explained that anything under $150 doesn’t have to be itemized on his quarterly campaign finance reports and said he’d imagined Maani could pay for pizzas or a case of bottled water.

“Okay, that’s the most important thing. I just want to, uh, avoid at all costs,” Maani said of having his expenditures be publicly reported. “You know what I’m saying?”

“Yeah, yeah,” Jones said.

After Maani told Jones it was his “cardinal rule” that he had to “just kind of conceal” the contribution, Jones responded with, “I feel you.”

“Six years later, on the stand — after he’s been charged w bribery — Mr. Jones testified those words meant he heard Omar Maani but wasn’t agreeing,” Kolluri said. “Come on, in what world does that make sense?”

Prosecutors also hammered on what turned out to be a no-work job for Jones’ former intern, Christopher Katz. Earlier this month, Maani testified that Jones’ request that he hire Katz directly after Jones came up with the $5,000 figure at their July 2019 dinner caught him off guard.

“But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office,” Jones told Maani. “And I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job.”

Read more: Sen. Jones sent spending money to former intern before getting him job feds say was a bribe

Jones testified that he’d made the request because he’d seen dozens of college students like Katz working for SafeSpeed when he took a tour of the company’s offices a few months prior. Katz actually hadn’t worked for Jones for more than a year at that point but the two were in touch about whether Jones could help him find employment.

But by their next dinner, Maani was expressing doubt to Jones that he’d be able to get Katz hired at SafeSpeed without attracting questions from his colleagues. Instead, Maani floated hiring Katz to work directly for him on a research project.

A few days later, Maani called Jones to tell him that he didn’t have much work for Maani but would put him on his payroll anyway. Jones raised no strong objections, only telling Maani, “Yeah, but um, let’s make sure we find him some work.”

“The defendant knew this was not a normal job,” Ardam said Monday, pointing out Jones had told Katz he “got the job” even before he’d sent Katz’s resume to Maani. “What that means is the defendant knew this was part of the bribe.”

Although Maani and Jones agreed that $15 per hour for Katz was fair, Jones denied knowing what Katz was being paid when a pair of FBI agents came knocking at his door on Sept. 24, 2019. It’s one of three lies the feds allege Jones told about the purported bribery scheme in that interview.

Read more: Feds set to rest case in Sen. Emil Jones III red-light camera bribery trial

The feds also say Jones lied about his promise to “protect” Maani and SafeSpeed from then-state Rep. David McSweeney, R-Barrington Hills, a friend of Jones who was also in favor of legislation to study red-light cameras but only because he wanted to see the industry abolished in Illinois.

Prosecutors also accused Jones of falsely telling FBI agents that he and Maani never discussed how a campaign contribution could be made without having it publicly reported.

Henderson, however, pointed out what Jones already testified to: He was nervous when the FBI agents were in his living room. The senator even flubbed the name of SafeSpeed’s CEO, Nikki Zollar, confusing it with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.

“Is he supposed to remember every single solitary word he said in a dinner 30 days ago, 60 days ago, 90 days ago?” Henderson asked the jury. “I guess according to the government, yes.”

But Kolluri encouraged jurors to listen back to the interview, which the agents secretly taped, as well as the recordings from each of the three dinners Jones shared with Maani.

“Sen. Jones put up his power for sale, as we saw on those recordings,” he said. “It was crystal clear.”

House Bill 121 would restrict access to bathrooms based strictly on biological sex. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Say a man who transitioned after being born a woman walks into a women’s bathroom, as House Bill 121 would require him to do.
The man has XX chromosomes but transitioned, and he outwardly presents as a man.
Monday, Missoula County District Court Judge Shane Vannatta asked lawyers in a dispute about HB 121 how Missoula County, for instance, should enforce  that situation.
House Bill 121 requires public restrooms and changing areas exclusively for males or females, requires people to use bathrooms based on “external genitalia present at birth,” and defines sex as strictly male and female.
It says a library or prison or museum, for example, “shall take reasonable steps” to provide individuals with privacy from members of the opposite sex.
Also, it says an individual who “encounters another individual of the opposite sex” in the restroom can file a civil lawsuit against the “covered entity,” such as a prison, domestic violence shelter or school.
In the court hearing on HB 121, Vannatta said in his hypothetical situation, a clerk who sees the transgender man walk into the bathroom might decide to sue the county.
The bill allows individuals to sue for failing to “take reasonable steps” to prohibit the other individuals from using the bathroom or changing room designated for the opposite sex.
Then what?
Thane Johnson, on behalf of the state, said it was the toughest situation he could think of related to the bill at issue in Perkins et al v. State of Montana.
“You raise a good hypothetical. I can’t deny that,” Johnson said.
But he also said the bill is “a little bit bigger” than being just a “bathroom bill.” He said the bill aims to protect women and young girls in facilities “where they have no choice,” such as detention centers.
“I think there are other issues that are dealt with by this bill that are important, and that’s my point,” Johnson said.
But Alex Rate, with the ACLU of Montana, said that situation is one of the “fatal problems” with the “disingenuous” law, and it’s one way harm starts to pile up for the clients of the ACLU and Legal Voice.
The plaintiffs allege the bill is illegal and violates the rights of clients under the state constitution, including “the rights to equal protection, privacy, to pursue life’s basic necessities, and due process.”
Rate said the clerk would sue Missoula County for failing to enforce HB 121, discovery would happen, and the transgender man just wanting to use the bathroom would be caught in the middle.
“That individual — who is doing nothing wrong and who is entirely removed from the dispute between the individual and the covered entity — would be dragged into a lawsuit,” Rate said.
In his remarks to the court, Rate also said the enforcement was problematic in that it created a “bounty hunter system.”
“It turns our state into a vigilante state, where ordinary citizens are incentivized to file lawsuits against state and local governments if they perceive that somebody is using the, quote, incorrect public facility,” Rate said.
Rate said the harm to people who are transgender and intersex starts immediately, although Johnson countered that the law needs time to be implemented. However, the lawyers agreed to Vannatta’s request for time to issue an order.
The bill landed in court on the same day Gov. Greg Gianforte signed it, and Vannatta issued a temporary restraining order soon after, halting implementation of the bill, but only for a matter of days.
With approval from the lawyers, however, Vannatta said Monday that he wanted to extend that expiring order through May 16 in order to give himself time to craft a new decision on the request to stop the bill through a final court decision.
The ACLU had asked for an order from the bench, or an immediate and verbal ruling, but Vannatta said he wanted to issue one in writing so the parties would have a rationale they could appeal.
In recent years, the Montana Legislature has approved numerous bills that affect people who are transgender, and in his arguments Monday, Rate said HB 121 is the most recent volley in a trend since 2018.
“This case challenges the latest manifestation of this state’s peculiar obsession with singling out transgender and intersex Montanans for discrimination and harassment,” Rate said.
Rate said the bill includes a definition of sex from an earlier bill, Senate Bill 458, which the same district court found had unconstitutionally treated cisgender individuals — whose gender aligns with their sex at birth — differently than transgender and intersex individuals.
But Rate said HB 121 is “particularly bigoted” because it bans trans people from using public restrooms, changing rooms and sleeping quarters — at domestic violence shelters — that correspond with their gender identity.
“It forces trans people to out themselves by using public facilities according to their sex assigned at birth,” Rate said.
He said it prevents intersex people from using public facilities altogether.
Rate said the case reminded him of the fight over a different bill, one that eliminated Election Day registration. He said the purported government interest was to prevent voter fraud, but the state’s lead witness had to search historical records to find any.
In the current case, he said, nearly 60% of people who are transgender report avoiding public restrooms to avoid confrontation given they are already vulnerable to violence, and his client’s declaration included evidence of fear.
And laws already on the books address other protections.
“We’ve got laws criminalizing indecent exposure,” Rate said. “We’ve got laws criminalizing sexual assault and violence.
“So there’s no need to adopt a law as draconian as HB 121 when individuals in public facilities are already protected.”
On behalf of the state, Johnson, however, said the law was the “Safe Space for Women and Girls Act,” a protection that resonated with his own experience.
Johnson said he recalled serving as a tribal court judge and seeing the number of young girls that became victims of sexual assault, and because federal prosecutors were slow in prosecuting, he saw juvenile offenders who were young girls.
“They acted out as a result of being a victim of sexual crime,” Johnson said.
He said he acknowledges people who are transgender are vulnerable, but he said they are not the only ones in that situation. He pointed to young girls, and especially those in a juvenile detention center, which the bill includes.
Johnson also said the Montana Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court could help if they decided whether sex discrimination includes transgender discrimination, but the question is still an open one.
At the same time, Johnson said, some of the fixes are simple, such as privacy for bathrooms. 
He said at one campus, “single use” simply meant creating privacy in the form of porta potties and ensuring locks on doors.
Vannatta, though, imagined what might happen during a game if the University of Montana decided to turn a bathroom with multiple stalls into a single-use restroom with 40 people waiting in line.
However, the judge also said the issue Johnson raised about safety in corrections facilities resonated with him.
Vannatta said he had talked to many judges who are “perplexed” when it comes time to sentence people to jail or prison who are trans or in the midst of a transition in ways that keep them safe and keep the broader population safe.
The judge also asked Johnson questions about a couple of situations the lawyer raised, including a Helena girl scared by a man who followed her into a bathroom.
“Was that a trans man or transgender individual?” the judge said.
Johnson said he didn’t have any indication the person was transgender, but he said the person assaulted the girl.
Vannatta also asked if Johnson had evidence that trans individuals have committed sexual assault in bathrooms or changing areas, the areas the bill is intended to protect.
Johnson said not in Montana, but outside the state. In response to the judge’s request for statistics, Johnson said he believed a person in North Carolina was sexually assaulted in a school bathroom by a person who had claimed to be transgender.
However, he said he believes “there are probably statistics developing,” and if the case proceeds, the state would compile them as best it could.
In general, Johnson said it was too early to see how the law was working, and he urged the court to take a step back and allow it to take effect.
“My bottom line, your honor, is this case cries for some factual development. Let’s see how it plays out,” Johnson said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bathroom-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 21:02:31.706806

“The decision keeps native carnivores like mountain lions and coyotes from being killed across Nevada’s 65 congressionally-designated Wilderness areas and 62 specially-protected Wilderness Study Areas, an area spanning over 6.2 million acres of federally-managed public lands, or roughly 9% of the state’s total landmass,” WildEarth Guardians, an environmental organization, said in a news release.  
“As the agency attempts to fix its deeply flawed and now invalid environmental analysis, top predators can continue playing their vital ecological roles free of human control and persecution in the state’s most remote and rugged public lands,” Jennifer Schwartz, Senior Staff Attorney for WildEarth Guardians, said in a news release.  
“Nevada’s wilderness and other specially protected areas should be sanctuaries for wildlife and places where people can experience true wilderness—not landscapes laced with traps, snares, and cyanide bombs,” Paul Ruprecht, Nevada Director for Western Watersheds Project, said in a news release. “The court’s decision underscores that the public has a right to know where and how lethal predator control is happening, especially when it puts people, pets, and native wildlife at risk.”
WildEarth Guardians and Western Watersheds Project, in 2021, challenged a decision allowing USDA-Wildlife Services in Nevada to employ aerial gunning, poisoning, trapping, and shooting of foxes, bobcats, coyotes, mountain lions, beavers, badgers, rabbits, ravens, and other wildlife on Nevada’s federal lands. The ruling marks the second time USDA Wildlife Services has shut down its lethal predator control operations since 2016, when it agreed not to respond to requests for predator control while it conducted an environmental analysis. 
The effort resumed following a court order allowing the agency to protect livestock grazing on federal lands. Monday’s ruling from the Ninth Circuit invalidated that order. 
The court ruled USDA Wildlife Services’ environment analysis was too broad and failed to consider the potential impacts on public safety and health of lethal methods such as lead shot, poisons, and cyanide ejectors, which were approved by President Donald Trump’s first administration.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Advocates from across the Navajo Nation gathered in front of the nation’s council meeting hall Monday, hoping to tell Navajo President Buu Nygren how frustrated and disappointed they are by his abrupt endorsement of Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to reinvigorate the nation’s coal industry.
But Nygren was in Washington, D.C. As part of his “engagement with our federal partners,” his office said on social media, he couldn’t address the Navajo Nation Council for its first meeting. That left advocates even more frustrated, they said, that they couldn’t speak to Nygren about their concerns.
Uranium transport through Navajo Nation sparks concerns in New Mexico

Advocates in speeches Monday pointed to the Nygren administration’s recent confidential agreement with uranium company Energy Fuels,, which allows the company to transport uranium ore across the Navajo Nation for a price and in exchange for the company’s promise to clean up abandoned uranium mines across the Navajo Nation.
Because of the late January agreement, several trucks carrying uranium ore and other material traverse the western side of the Navajo Nation most days, carrying the material from a mine near the Grand Canyon to a mill in Utah.
The agreement would also apply to the eastern side of the Navajo Nation, which falls in New Mexico, if a proposed massive uranium mine near Mount Taylor is ever approved for operation. That project, called the Roca Honda Mine, is now a “priority project” at the Cibola National Forest, thanks to Trump’s executive order seeking to boost domestic energy production.
In addition to the uranium transport agreement, advocates on Monday also noted that Nygren last week endorsed Trump’s “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” executive order and took a selfie with him during the signing ceremony.

Advocate Percy Deal spoke at the rally Monday in English and Navajo, saying Peabody Energy’s coal mining operations beginning in the 1960s have drained an untold amount of water from aquifer vital to in his community on the Black Mesa plateau in northeast Arizona for generations, plus contributed to climate change.
So he was surprised and alarmed that Nygren, whom he called “Hastiin Bich’ah Lizhinigii” in Navajo or “the man in the black hat” in English, would endorse executive orders boosting coal production from Trump, “Mr. yellow hair,” without consulting people like him who have been so harmed by coal extraction.
“All these things probably are now in the hands of Mr. yellow hair. The sad thing is that Hastiin Bich’ah Lizhinigii never spoke to any of us. Never did,” Deal told attendees. “He’s got a vehicle here furnished by the tribe. He could have gone out to, for example, the Black Mesa and talked to us.”
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

Nygren’s spokesperson, Alistair Bitsoi, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the group’s criticism Monday afternoon. But Nygren in a letter published Monday on social media defended his endorsement of Trump’s energy executive orders.
“I accepted the invitation [to the White House] because the three executive orders that President Trump signed are intended to advance America’s dominance in energy,” Nygren wrote. “The Navajo Nation shares the goal of American energy dominance because the Navajo Nation has for 100 years been a part of the energy framework of the United States.
“Our lands have natural resources and transmission lines, also known as the grid. We will forever be part of the American energy framework and therefore Navajo’s voice and involvement in these discussions is required,” he wrote.
Advocates said that Nygren’s latest endorsements are a stark contrast from language on his website listing his priorities for the environment, which begins by saying, “Mitigating the effects of climate change on Navajo land is our responsibility, and the Nygren Administration will ensure Navajo community voices are empowered in protecting our water, air and land.”

Larry J. King, who grew up in Church Rock, said at the rally that he once worked in uranium mines in New Mexico and in 1979 he witnessed the United Nuclear spill there, which is the largest accidental release of radiation in United States history. He told Source New Mexico that Nygren, who took office in January 2023, repeatedly promised during his election to clean up uranium mine waste from his community at Red Water Pond but then ignored his calls.
That’s one reason King said he does not believe Nygren’s promises that the new transport agreement will result in the cleanup of legacy uranium mines in areas like Red Water Pond. For one thing, he’s skeptical of “high-pressure slurry ablation,” which Navajo Nation officials have touted as an emerging treatment method for the cleanup process.
King noted that Nygren endorsed Kamala Harris and traveled with the Democratic delegation to the Democratic convention last year. He said he sees Nygren’s latest endorsements as a betrayal of his promises and his constituents.
“He’s just making a turnaround, and in support of all this industry wanting to come and desecrate,” he said. “A repeat of what we’ve been through trying to remedy the situation from the last 30 to 40 years. He’s just, he’s going back.”

Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, speaks Friday, April 26, 2024, on the floor of the Alaska House of Representatives. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Legislation passed Wednesday by the Alaska House of Representatives would require the state’s school districts to adopt policies that restrict the use of cellphones by students during school hours.
House Bill 57, which will advance to the Senate after a 34-6 vote, does not require districts to ban students’ cellphones altogether but does require them to regulate students’ use of phones during regular school hours, including during lunch and the time between classes.
An earlier version of the bill would have required the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development to draft a model policy as an example for districts to follow, but that requirement was eliminated in a floor amendment. 
The amendment also eliminated a requirement that school districts report their academic performance before and after the new cellphone policy.
Cellphones would be allowed for translation purposes, in emergencies, for medical reasons, and as needed for instruction.
Restrictions on cellphones in the classroom are growing in popularity across the country, and eight states — including Florida, California, Virginia and Indiana — have banned them altogether. 
Every state except Nevada and Wyoming has proposed or is considering a statewide ban or restriction, according to a tally kept by the Associated Press. Some members of Congress are considering national legislation.
The bans come amid a broadening base of research that shows smartphone and social media use can contribute to negative mental health and poor academic achievement among students in grade school and high school.
Several lawmakers, including Gov. Mike Dunleavy, proposed legislation this year that would restrict cellphone use in schools.
HB 57, from Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, became the leading bill. 
On April 11, Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, proposed an amendment that rewrote the bill’s language to reflect a section of an education bill approved by the Senate Education Committee.
Ruffridge said he thinks Alaskans believe in local control of education.
“The language of Amendment No. 2 gives that ability to govern yourselves and be as strict or as permissive as possible at the district level,” he said. 
Fields spoke against the amendment, saying it turned HB 57 from a cellphone ban into “a cellphone discouragement policy.”
The amendment passed on a 19-18 vote.
Five days later, when the bill came up for a final vote, Fields voted for it.
“The amendment adopted to this bill substantially weakens it,” Fields said. “I’m still going to vote for the bill and send it to the next body because I think there’s an opportunity to resurrect better language.”
Other legislators also stood up in support, offering anecdotal stories about the way cellphones have affected their children and children they know. 
“Parents and our state are at war against these screens,” said Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, speaking in favor of the bill.
A handful of legislators spoke against the bill, including Ruffridge, whose amendment significantly rewrote it.
Ruffridge said he supports giving local school districts the authority to make decisions like this.
“It’s not up to us to do,” he said.
Rep. David Nelson, R-Anchorage, said that there are plenty of reasons to be concerned about kids’ mental health, but that is a wider issue than just cellphones.
“If we’re going to be trusting young people and saying, ‘Hey, you are the future,’ why are we banning communication devices in public schools?” he said. 
HB 57 is subject to a reconsideration vote on the House floor before it advances to the Senate, but legislators said they don’t expect the tally to change much, if at all.
The bill has been tentatively scheduled for a hearing in the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday.

Private equity firms have been buying up hospitals in recent years; cutbacks and closures sometimes follow. (Courtesy of the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Professionals)A California for-profit health care company said Monday it plans to close its remaining hospitals in Pennsylvania’s fifth most populous county and fire thousands of employees after failing to find a buyer.
Prospect Medical Holdings filed papers Monday in bankruptcy court seeking approval to close the two Crozer Health System hospitals in Delaware County before they run out of cash. The announcement was met with condemnation from state and local officials, who had provided a $40 million lifeline while the company worked to reach a solution to keep them open.
“Prospect’s decision to move forward with the closure of the Crozer Health System is a devastating and disgraceful blow to our communities, our healthcare workers, and every patient who has ever relied on our local hospital system,” state lawmakers from Delaware County said in a joint statement Monday. “Yet again, Prospect decided to put profits over patients by putting Crozer’s assets up for auction.”
The closures will affect Crozer Chester Medical Center in Upland and Taylor Hospital in Ridley Park, which remained open after Prospect closed two other Delaware County hospitals in recent years. Three ambulatory surgery and imaging centers will remain open pending a sale.

“Prospect Medical Holdings, the for-profit owner of Crozer Health, pillaged these hospitals for their own gain – and today, we see the result of their greed and mismanagement with the announced closure and loss of critical health care services for the people of Delaware County,” Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement.
Crozer Health System has received $5 million in annual state funding for the last decade. Shapiro said his office would continue fighting for the patients who have been harmed by the closures.
“Prospect caused this crisis, and they must be held accountable for their reckless actions that have led to today’s announcement,” Shapiro said, adding that the bankruptcy process should include a full review of the company’s conduct and mismanagement. He also called on lawmakers to pass legislation he has proposed to get private equity out of the health care business in Pennsylvania.
The closures will leave Delaware County, population 576,000, with only two hospitals, owned by Main Line Health and Trinity Health Mid-Atlantic. Prospect, with more than 2,600 employers, is one of the county’s largest employers. It owns 16 hospitals in California, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
A spokesperson for Prospect said it recognizes the impact its decision will have on patients and employees and that the company worked tirelessly with state Attorney General Dave Sunday and other officials but were unable to find a viable alternative.
“At this time, the focus at Crozer Health remains on seamlessly transitioning patients to other health facilities so that they can continue to receive the critical, uninterrupted care they require, and to support Crozer Health team members as they seek to identify other employment opportunities,” the spokesperson said.
Previously owned by Los Angeles-based private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, Prospect was saddled with $1.3 billion debt as its owners took more than $645 million in dividends and fees, according to ProPublica.

Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January while it attempted to restructure. It sought approval to sell the hospitals to a new owner in exchange for assuming their existing liabilities. 
The following month, Prospect began working with Sunday to appoint a receiver and facilitate $20.2 million in state funding to keep the hospitals running while Prospect and the potential new owner worked to finalize the deal. The philanthropic organization, Foundation for Delaware County, provided another $20 million.
Sunday said in a statement that he was deeply disappointed by the closure announcement.
“Along with the Governor’s office and other state and local leaders, we worked tirelessly to avoid this outcome. Unfortunately, the damage inflicted by Leonard Green & Partners — the private equity owners of Prospect — who prioritized their own wealth over the wellbeing of a community, was too much to overcome,” Sunday said, adding that his office would continue working through the bankruptcy process to pursue the state’s financial claims and hold Prospect accountable.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/private-equity-picket-1024x768-1.jpg,,,2025-04-21 21:02:31.706806

Greg Gianforte.
Last week, House Bill 316 sponsored by Rep. Lee Deming, R-Laurel, failed to earn the minimum 100 votes out of 150 in the Montana Legislature needed to present a constitutional amendment to voters.
The bill came following the passage in November 2024 of Constitutional Initiative 128 to protect abortion. It passed with 58% of the vote.
In a statement Friday, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana CEO and President Martha Fuller said Montanans will rest easier knowing the attempt to ignore their wishes and “undermine the right to an abortion” has failed.
“The government is not now and never will be the expert on the lives, families or pregnancies of Montanans — it’s high time for politicians to respect the personal and medical privacy of their constituents,” Fuller said in a statement about HB 316.
The bill earned 58 “yes” votes in the House and 33 “yes” votes in the Senate on third readings.
The 2025 Montana Legislature has taken up other bills related to abortion, although legislators tabled a number of them. However, House Bill 388 and Senate Bill 154 both are headed to the desk of Gianforte.
HB 388, sponsored by Rep. Amy Regier, R-Kalispell, would allow pregnancy centers to operate without regulation.
Proponents including the Montana Family Foundation said those centers should not be punished for refusing to facilitate abortions, according to reporting from the Montana State News Bureau.
Opponents said those facilities are not required to provide legitimate medical information or protect privacy, and they misinform clients.
SB 154, sponsored by Sen. Daniel Emrich, R-Great Falls, prohibits the sale of whole human bodies and human fetal tissue, which is already illegal under federal law.
On the Senate floor earlier this session, Emrich said it was “a great bill” and makes sure bodies and fetal tissue are “being donated and not sold as a commodity inside the state of Montana.”
In the final debate on HB 316, which took place in the Senate on Thursday, Sen. Vince Ricci, R-Billings, said he couldn’t imagine a greater violation of human dignity or of privacy than abortion.
“The state has a compelling interest (in) protecting the lives of the most vulnerable human beings, and the human being … in the womb has … a life interest equal to that of his or her mother,” said Ricci, who carried the bill.
Sen. Jeremy Trebas, R-Great Falls, said those who supported the protection of abortion approved a measure that is “immoral and wrong.”
“I think abortion is murder, and I’ll catch heck for that I’m sure, but it’s the killing of a person, a formed, live person. Making it a right to privacy is baloney,” Trebas said.
He said the Montana Supreme Court made an inappropriate link to privacy when it extended it to abortion because “this is the child’s body that we’re talking about. And they have a right to life.”
Minority Leader Pat Flowers said Montanans don’t support the attacks against the right to privacy, and it was time to focus on other issues, such as tax bills.
“Call it baloney or not, it’s in the Constitution, and it’s an important right,” said Flowers, D-Belgrade.
Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, said the bill would outlaw in vitro fertilization, and Montanans all love mothers and babies and want more of them in the state.
Neumann also asked if the state should control men’s bodies.
“If we’re going to try to have this type of control over women’s bodies, because the fetus is part of the woman’s body, are we also going to try to have this type of control over men’s bodies?” Neumann said.“Are we going to regulate ejaculation? This is what we’re talking about. We are talking about regulating the internal parts of bodies.”
Sen. Laura Smith, D-Helena, said the bill could create a “legal quagmire” for any doctor who needed to provide medical care to a pregnant woman who was experiencing a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.
“This legislation would effectively tie doctors’ hands rather than allowing them to treat their patients without fear or prosecution,” said Smith, a lawyer.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1422564336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 20:04:26.147965

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed a federal lawsuit Monday alleging that eight new laws governing direct democracy are unconstitutional.
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Arkansas is one of 24 states to allow this process, which involves collecting a minimum amount of signatures on petitions for proposed ballot language.
The Republican supermajority in the Arkansas Legislature passed a slew of bills during the 2025 legislative session, which ended last week, placing new restrictions on the solicitation, collection and submission of signatures for citizen-led ballot initiatives. Democratic lawmakers and members of the public said the restrictions will have a chilling effect on the people’s right to have a say in their own laws and Constitution.
The legal complaint lists the eight laws the plaintiffs consider violations of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment right to freedom of speech and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due process under the law:

Act 153 clarifies that the certification of ballot titles for initiatives, referendums and constitutional amendments as well as the signatures collected for those measures would only be valid for the next general election.
Act 154 expands the attorney general’s existing authority to reject a proposal if it conflicts with the U.S. Constitution or federal statutes and prevents the sponsor of a measure from submitting more than one conflicting petition simultaneously.
Act 218 requires signature gatherers, known as canvassers, to inform potential signers that petition fraud is a criminal offense.
Act 240 requires canvassers to request a photo ID from potential signers.
Act 241 requires canvassers to file a “true affidavit” with the secretary of state, the executive branch office that oversees elections, certifying they complied with the Arkansas Constitution and state laws related to canvassing, perjury, forgery and fraudulent practices in the procurement of petition signatures. Signatures submitted without the affidavit would not be counted.
Act 273 disqualifies signatures collected by canvassers if the secretary of state finds “by a preponderance of evidence” that they violated state law collecting the signatures.
Act 274 requires potential signers to read a petition’s ballot title or have it read to them; failure to ensure this would result in a misdemeanor charge against the canvasser.
Act 453 requires canvassers who are paid to collect signatures to be permanent residents of Arkansas. A sponsor of a ballot measure would be fined $2,500 per paid canvasser hired who does not meet this requirement.

The plaintiffs also ask the court to block defendant Secretary of State Cole Jester from enforcing four of the challenged laws — Acts 218, 240, 241 and 274 — due to the Arkansas Constitution’s provision that ensures the right to direct democracy.
The complaint also asks the court to declare portions of existing ballot initiative law adopted since 2013 unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions.
Supporters of the new laws said during the legislative session that they will protect the integrity of the ballot initiative process and discourage sloppy, misleading or illegal behavior by canvassers.
Instead, the laws “weaponize bureaucracy to suppress citizen participation and violate the fundamental rights guaranteed by both the Arkansas and U.S. Constitutions,” said David Couch, the plaintiffs’ lead attorney and a sponsor of multiple past direct democracy efforts, in Monday’s news release from the League of Women Voters announcing the lawsuit.
The laws also “will permanently dismantle the ballot initiative process in Arkansas” if they are not struck down in court, Couch said.
Six of the eight laws went into effect immediately upon Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ signature due to their emergency clauses. Acts 153 and 453 will go into effect in August, 90 days after the Legislature adjourns sine die in May.

 ‘Significant barriers’

Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, was the Senate sponsor of all eight laws being challenged. He announced in January that he will run next year for secretary of state; Jester cannot run for the position because he was appointed, not elected.
Named as plaintiffs in addition to the League of Women Voters of Arkansas are its President Bonnie Miller, its Benton County chapter President Danielle Quesnell, and Save AR Democracy, a ballot question committee seeking to collect signatures for a proposed constitutional amendment for next year’s ballot.
“Let’s be clear: these laws spell the death of direct democracy in Arkansas,” Miller said in the news release. “For decades, Arkansans of all political persuasions have utilized the ballot initiative process to pass popular reforms in our state. Now, the legislature wants to kill the process.”
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas is a frequent participant in direct democracy efforts and “cannot qualify a measure for the ballot without the use of paid canvassers,” according to the complaint.
“The statutes sought to be declared unconstitutional have and will substantially restrict the ability of LWVAR and its members to participate in the initiative and referendum process,” the complaint states.
Acts 218, 240 and 274 in particular “impose significant barriers on sponsors’ ability to recruit canvassers — who may not want to risk potential criminal penalties resulting from an inadvertent failure to comply with the acts’ arduous and technical rules — and canvassers’ ability to gather signatures,” according to the plaintiffs.

complaint from LWV 
Couch has twice submitted ballot language on behalf of LWVAR and Save AR Democracy to amend the state Constitution’s initiative and referendum processes. Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin rejected the effort for a second time last week, calling the ballot language misleading.
Griffin’s office will represent Jester and is “reviewing the lawsuit and stand[ing] ready to defend the state,” spokesperson Jeff LeMaster said.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks of the Western District of Arkansas has been assigned to the case.
 Past legislative action and ballot measures

State lawmakers have previously sought voter approval for changes to the direct democracy process.
In 2020, roughly 56% of Arkansas voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that the Legislature referred to the ballot in 2019. It would have required canvassers to gather signatures from at least 45 counties, and it would have moved up several petition deadlines, among other things.
Then in 2022, roughly 59% of Arkansans voted down an amendment put forth by the Legislature in 2021 to require a 60% majority to pass most statewide ballot initiatives.
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas publicly opposed the 2022 ballot measure. Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, introduced that measure and was the House sponsor of this year’s Act 153 and Act 154.
In 2023, the Legislature passed and Sanders signed a law increasing the number of counties where ballot initiative supporters must gather signatures from 15 to 50. Couch and the League of Women Voters challenged this law in Pulaski County Circuit Court, where the case is still pending. Rep. Kendon Underwood, R-Cave Springs, was the House sponsor of this law and of five of the eight new laws being challenged.
Arkansas judge will allow amended complaint in challenge to new ballot petition law

The higher threshold for secretary of state approval did not stop reproductive rights advocates from collecting more than 102,000 signatures in 53 counties in an attempt to put a proposed limited right to abortion on the November 2024 ballot. Citizen-led constitutional amendments require 90,704 signatures.
The proposed abortion amendment did not end up on the ballot after then-Secretary of State John Thurston’s office disqualified more than 14,000 signatures on a technicality and the state Supreme Court upheld this decision. Supporters of the amendment accused Thurston of abusing his power, while supporters of this year’s fleet of bills from Hammer publicly alleged fraud and misconduct by canvassers for the abortion amendment.
After Thurston was elected state treasurer in November, Sanders appointed Jester to succeed him, and Jester took office Jan. 2. In February, he expressed support for Hammer’s bills and claimed a “top-to-bottom security review” of Arkansas’ election procedures found “thousands of fraudulent signatures” on petitions for ballot measures.
Hammer sponsored an additional bill that would have created an enforcement agency within the Secretary of State’s office to investigate the validity of submitted ballot initiative documents. The bill died in a Senate committee after being voted down twice.
On Wednesday, the final day of the session, the House voted down a bill that would have placed a 500-word limit on ballot titles and given the Legislature the authority to overturn voter-approved constitutional amendments. Hammer supported the bill but was not one of its sponsors.

But Nygren was in Washington, D.C. As part of his “engagement with our federal partners,” his office said on social media, he couldn’t address the Navajo Nation Council for its first meeting. That left advocates even more frustrated, they said, that they couldn’t speak to Nygren about their concerns. 
Uranium transport through Navajo Nation sparks concerns in New Mexico

Advocates in speeches Monday pointed to the Nygren administration’s recent confidential agreement with uranium company Energy Fuels,, which allows the company to transport uranium ore across the Navajo Nation for a price and in exchange for the company’s promise to clean up abandoned uranium mines across the Navajo Nation. 
Because of the late January agreement, several trucks carrying uranium ore and other material traverse the western side of the Navajo Nation most days, carrying the material from a mine near the Grand Canyon to a mill in Utah. 
The agreement would also apply to the eastern side of the Navajo Nation, which falls in New Mexico, if a proposed massive uranium mine near Mount Taylor is ever approved for operation. That project, called the Roca Honda Mine, is now a “priority project” at the Cibola National Forest, thanks to Trump’s executive order seeking to boost domestic energy production. 
In addition to the uranium transport agreement, advocates on Monday also noted that Nygren last week endorsed Trump’s “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” executive order and took a selfie with him during the signing ceremony.

Advocate Percy Deal spoke at the rally Monday in English and Navajo, saying Peabody Energy’s coal mining operations beginning in the 1960s have drained an untold amount of water from aquifer vital to in his community on the Black Mesa plateau in northeast Arizona for generations, plus contributed to climate change. 
So he was surprised and alarmed that Nygren, whom he called “Hastiin Bich’ah Lizhinigii” in Navajo or “the man in the black hat” in English, would endorse executive orders boosting coal production from Trump, “Mr. yellow hair,” without consulting people like him who have been so harmed by coal extraction. 
“All these things probably are now in the hands of Mr. yellow hair. The sad thing is that Hastiin Bich’ah Lizhinigii never spoke to any of us. Never did,” Deal told attendees. “He’s got a vehicle here furnished by the tribe. He could have gone out to, for example, the Black Mesa and talked to us.”
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

Nygren’s spokesperson, Alistair Bitsoi, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the group’s criticism Monday afternoon. But Nygren in a letter published Monday on social media defended his endorsement of Trump’s energy executive orders.
“I accepted the invitation [to the White House] because the three executive orders that President Trump signed are intended to advance America’s dominance in energy,” Nygren wrote. “The Navajo Nation shares the goal of American energy dominance because the Navajo Nation has for 100 years been a part of the energy framework of the United States. 
“Our lands have natural resources and transmission lines, also known as the grid. We will forever be part of the American energy framework and therefore Navajo’s voice and involvement in these discussions is required,” he wrote. 
Advocates said that Nygren’s latest endorsements are a stark contrast from language on his website listing his priorities for the environment, which begins by saying, “Mitigating the effects of climate change on Navajo land is our responsibility, and the Nygren Administration will ensure Navajo community voices are empowered in protecting our water, air and land.”

Larry J. King, who grew up in Church Rock, said at the rally that he once worked in uranium mines in New Mexico and in 1979 he witnessed the United Nuclear spill there, which is the largest accidental release of radiation in United States history. He told Source New Mexico that Nygren, who took office in January 2023, repeatedly promised during his election to clean up uranium mine waste from his community at Red Water Pond but then ignored his calls.
That’s one reason King said he does not believe Nygren’s promises that the new transport agreement will result in the cleanup of legacy uranium mines in areas like Red Water Pond. For one thing, he’s skeptical of “high-pressure slurry ablation,” which Navajo Nation officials have touted as an emerging treatment method for the cleanup process. 
King noted that Nygren endorsed Kamala Harris and traveled with the Democratic delegation to the Democratic convention last year. He said he sees Nygren’s latest endorsements as a betrayal of his promises and his constituents. 
“He’s just making a turnaround, and in support of all this industry wanting to come and desecrate,” he said. “A repeat of what we’ve been through trying to remedy the situation from the last 30 to 40 years. He’s just, he’s going back.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9493-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 20:04:26.147965

Brian Kemp gives remarks before signing new lawsuit limits into law at the state Capitol Monday. Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderGov. Brian Kemp signed new lawsuit award limits into law Monday that he argues will bring balance to Georgia’s legal environment and send relief to the state’s businesses.
The signing marks the end of a bruising fight at the state Capitol with both sides of the aisle feeling the fallout. But the debate over whether the pair of bills will help rein in costs rages on.
“Both of these bills accomplished our goal of leveling the playing field in Georgia’s courtrooms and ensuring our business environment remains the best in the nation,” Kemp said in remarks at the state Capitol Monday.
“(They) simply bring transparency and fairness to a process that has been abused for too long, that has driven up costs for businesses and consumers alike,” he added.
Some of the bills’ biggest supporters caution that it will take time for that relief to come.

Chris Clark, president and CEO of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce said he believed the changes would help the state’s small businesses and health care providers, especially in rural communities – but not overnight.
“It’s not an easy fix. It’s not going to lower rates for everybody tomorrow,” Clark said Monday. “But if it can stabilize them, I think that’s a huge win.”
Insurance Commissioner John King, a Republican who is seen as a potential U.S. Senate candidate, said Monday that he expects to see reduced rates. If not, King said he wants to hear insurers explain why rates are not decreasing.
“We’ve expended so much political currency in getting this done. Now I expect insurance companies to meet us in the middle,” King said.
In January, Kemp pledged to drag lawmakers back to Atlanta for a special session if “meaningful, impactful” changes were not made to the state’s civil litigation system. At one point, the governor’s top aide said the governor’s war chest would be used to back primary challengers for GOP defectors.
In the end, the votes did not fall neatly along party lines, with eight Republican lawmakers in the House voting against Senate Bill 68, which contained the bulk of the changes. It just barely cleared the House with a 91-82 vote after some changes were made.
The main bill includes provisions that would limit owners’ liability for injuries that occur on their property, restrict damages awarded for medical bills, and enable trials to more easily be split into multiple stages so that juries can determine liability and damages separately. 
Georgia Democrats blasted Monday’s bill signing.
“Congratulations to Brian Kemp for threatening and arm-twisting his way to the signing of his number one priority this year: shielding insurance companies from accountability to Georgians in court,” said Matthew Wilson, who is serving as interim chair of the Democratic Party Georgia and who is also a trial lawyer. 
Rep. Tanya Miller, an Atlanta Democrat and an attorney who was a leading voice of opposition to the bills this session, said Monday that if insurance rates do stabilize, it won’t be because the state limited lawsuits in Georgia.
Miller called the Kemp-backed package “a manufactured solution to a manufactured problem.”
“The truth is, this so-called reform was never about solving a real problem,” Miller said. “The tort reform campaign has long been run on half-truths, selective anecdotes, and outright misinformation. There was no crisis in our judicial system, and no credible data supports the claim that injured citizens seeking justice in a court of law caused insurance premiums to spike.”
The bill had faced opposition from crime victims and their families and the trial attorneys who represent them. In the House, the bill was changed to carve out greater protections for survivors of human trafficking, but lawmakers did not extend similar protections to other child, elderly and sexual assault victims.
Critics had argued that the last-minute changes didn’t go far enough.
“Our laws should stand up for injured Georgians, not give big corporations a free pass for turning a blind eye,” said Rep. Stacey Evans, an Atlanta Democrat and an attorney who also helped lead the Democratic opposition to the bill.
In the House, the focus on insurance rates will continue this year. House Speaker Jon Burns last week announced the creation of a blue-ribbon study committee on insurance rates.
“Throughout the interim, the House will take another look at something that’s important: a close look at our state’s insurance markets and premiums to ensure that our fellow Georgians and companies of every size have access to coverage and are not being subjected to unjustified rate increases,” Burns said in remarks at Monday’s bill signing ceremony.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)As higher education faces potential cuts to federal funding and grants, Rhode Island College (RIC) just received a prestigious recognition to help boost its cybersecurity program’s access to federal money and support. 
The National Security Administration (NSA) affirmed RIC as a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense, the school announced at an on-campus event Monday. The NSA award is given to schools that meet high standards for cybersecurity education, and gives schools additional grant opportunities via the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation. 
Schools may choose from one of three specialties within the designation, and RIC’s program falls under the “cyber defense” banner. The specific program recognized at RIC is a Bachelor of Arts in computer science with a minor in cybersecurity. RIC’s cybersecurity major, which was added to the school’s offerings after the minor, is eligible to be considered for the NSA branding starting in 2026. 
“This recognition tells the world that Rhode Island College is the gold standard for cybersecurity education,” RIC President Jack Warner said at the event. “Our graduates will enter the workforce prepared to tackle the complex digital challenges of the next century.”
The cybersecurity minor is part of the school’s Institute for Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies, which opened in 2023. Warner was joined by former U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, who chairs the Institute, and a sampling of Rhode Island’s elected officials, including all four of the state’s Congressional delegates plus Gov. Dan McKee, state Sen. Lou DiPalma of Middletown and Marianne Raimondo, dean of the business school at RIC.
Langevin, who formerly sat on the U.S. House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection, was praised by his former colleagues as a keen observer and early evangelist of cybersecurity’s importance within government.    
“This day should probably be known as Jim Langevin Day,” Sen. Jack Reed said during his turn at the podium. “Jim was one of the first members of Congress to recognize the criticality of cyber in our daily lives.”
Delegates emphasized the need for a workforce well-trained in the art of defense. U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner pointed to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as significant sources of cyber threats. In his time on the Committee on Homeland Security as well as its cybersecurity subcommittee, Magaziner said he’s learned a lot about other nations’ interest in cybercrime.
“The Chinese government employs literally tens of thousands — not hundreds, not thousands, but tens of thousands of people — whose whole job is to go to work every day and try to hack into the systems of the United States,” Magaziner said. “And when I say hack into systems in the United States, I don’t just mean the Pentagon or government systems. I mean water, sewer, electrical grids, Air Force … just the scale of it is unbelievable.”
Langevin, himself a RIC graduate, acknowledged his emphasis on cyber during his time as a congressman. 
“I cannot think of a more meaningful way to continue my career in cybersecurity policy than to help craft the way we train the next generation of cyber security professionals, cyber defenders,” Langevin said.

The federal designation is another show of support for the institute, following voter approval last November of a ballot question that authorized bond spending for capital improvements at RIC and University of Rhode Island. RIC is using its $73 million share of the nearly $161 million bond to turn Whipple Hall into a dedicated home for the institute, which will include new spaces for students to learn cyber defense techniques. That includes an IBM Cyber Range, which simulates cyberattacks so students can learn how to respond in real time. Construction is currently underway and is expected to be ready by the time the academic year starts in the fall.  
After the speaking program, Suzanne Mello Stark, chair of the Computer Science and Information Systems department at RIC, called the designation “really exciting…It means that we are vetted. Our students are vetted,” she said. “So if they go apply for jobs in cybersecurity, they will see that they come from a school that meets the requirements of the National Security Agency.”
Stark pointed to the federal Scholarship for Service Program as one benefit of the designation. The program lets students get a scholarship, a stipend, and job experience working in government cybersecurity positions ranging from federal roles to tribal positions. 
Douglas Alexander, the institute’s director, said the designation was a bright spot amid recent funding woes nationwide. “When it comes to the military and cyber security, I think we’re all in agreement that this is an important program to keep going and to keep supporting the nation, and I don’t think there’s a lot of partisan politics involved in that,” he said. 
And it’s not just the federal government that needs workers with strong information technology skillsets, Alexander said. Smaller government entities often need competent IT professionals the most, and usually can’t afford dedicated cybersecurity positions like larger companies can. Having previously worked in a municipal role in Warwick Public Schools, Alexander said he “knows that feeling of being pulled in a million different directions.”
“The contrast between the commercial sector and the public sector is really stark, and we really need to do a lot to close the gap,” Alexander said. “Really fundamental IT skills are also something that the state lacks, just in head count, just in personnel. The IT folks that we have are brilliant. I know a lot of them, and they are working really, really hard … but we just don’t have enough of them.”
Students learn the ins and outs of basic network security in the school’s cyber program, Alexander said, with the hope they’ll be able to tackle positions ranging from municipal IT officer to cyber analyst at large corporate firms. And he hopes the new cyber range will facilitate more of these connections between industry, government and higher ed, especially once construction is complete and people know what the space is capable of.
“That kind of cross pollination … is our secret weapon here in Rhode Island, because we can all travel to one place in a day, unlike a lot of states, where you see each other once a year,” Alexander said.

(Courtesy of U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York)The wife of former Sen. Bob Menendez was convicted Monday of taking bribes and obstructing justice as part of the wide-ranging, international bribery scheme that landed her husband an 11-year prison sentence.
A Manhattan jury found that Nadine Arslanian Menendez, 58, accepted bribes like gold bars, cash, and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for power and political influence, then tried to hide her actions from federal investigators. Bob Menendez was convicted after a separate trial last year.
Outside the federal courthouse in Manhattan, Nadine Menendez’s attorney Barry Coburn said they respect the judge and the jury, but said it’s a “very rough day for us.” Coburn said it’s “quite possible” they request a delay in sentencing, and declined to comment on whether she’s seeking a pardon. 
“I have no doubt in my mind that the jury did what they thought was right, and I don’t think there’s any point to my standing here and debating any of that, so I decline to do that,” he said. “But the case is not over. There will be other days. ” 
The jury deliberated for about seven hours over two days before finding Menendez guilty of all 15 counts, including bribery, obstruction of justice, extortion, and conspiracy to commit those crimes. Some of those charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years.  
She is scheduled to be sentenced June 12. That’s six days after Bob Menendez is expected to report to prison for his 11-year sentence.
Bob Menendez was sentenced in January after he was found guilty of taking bribes from three New Jersey businessmen in exchange for political favors for foreign governments and meddling in two criminal investigations. 
Nadine Menendez, wearing a pink mask and a black shawl, did not speak to a crowd of reporters outside the courthouse Monday. Her attorney did not comment on why Bob Menendez didn’t attend his wife’s trial.
The two started dating in 2018 and married in 2020. Two years later, their Englewood Cliffs home was raided by FBI agents who uncovered hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars.  
Nadine Menendez was first indicted in September 2023 alongside her husband and three businessmen accused of bribing them, Fred Daibes, Wael Hana, and Jose Uribe. She was diagnosed with breast cancer, requiring treatment that delayed her trial for months.
Hana and Daibes were convicted alongside the former senator in July, and are also set to go to prison. Uribe pleaded guilty to bribing the Menendezes so Bob Menendez would kill a criminal prosecution targeting Uribe. Uribe, who testified in both trials, has not been sentenced yet.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Menendez-Hana-selfie-3.jpg,,,2025-04-21 20:04:26.147965

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Senate approved a bill on Monday that would put data protections in place for immigrants and limit where federal immigration authorities can physically access without a warrant. The legislation comes in direct response to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.
Senate Bill 25-276 passed on a 22-13 vote and now heads to the House for consideration in the final weeks of the legislative session.
“The question of who actually gets to be an American, or who actually gets to be protected by the Constitution, is a matter of debate right now in this country and in this state. We’ve had conversations with teachers and with school districts that are concerned about students being too afraid to come to class and about parents being afraid to go to parent teacher conferences. We can do better than that,” said bill sponsor Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat.

The bill would prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from going into non-public spaces in jails, hospitals, schools and child care centers without a signed, valid warrant. An amendment on the Senate floor added libraries to that list of locations.
It also clarifies that local law enforcement cannot cooperate with ICE to land a person in custody through a detainer request by holding that person in jail beyond their ordered release without a warrant.
The bill also deals heavily with personally identifiable information, or data about a person that is not publicly available such as birthday, addresses, vehicle registration information and immigration status, which federal authorities might want access to in order to identify people to detain and deport. Local governments would not be allowed to share that type of information with ICE under the bill.
Additionally, immigrants would not need to sign an affidavit about their intention to pursue legal status in order to get a driver’s license or in-state tuition.
“We’re in unprecedented times, where people are being unjustly targeted, incarcerated, removed and deported, and we sit in a position where we might be able to push back and help out, to provide some sort of protection,” said Sen. Jessie Danielson, a Wheat Ridge Democrat. “It is a terrifying time for a number of people I know, and for a lot of people I don’t, and it doesn’t take much for me to empathize with that.”
GOP: Lawsuits likely
The bill comes three months into the second administration of President Donald Trump, who has followed through on a campaign promise to increase efforts to detain and remove immigrants who lack legal status. In Colorado, that has resulted in a series of highly-publicized immigration raids at a party in Adams County and residences in Denver and Aurora and in the detention of immigration rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra.
In addition to Gonzales, the bill is sponsored by Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat, Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adams County Democrat, and Rep. Elizabeth Velasco, a Glenwood Springs Democrat.
Sen. Kyle Mullica, a Thornton Democrat, joined Republicans in opposition to the bill. Mullica said his vote was in response to a series of amendments offered during the final vote on Monday — usually amendments are considered during the initial debate and preliminary vote on a bill — and that he did not have sufficient time to read the amendments and consider their implications. One amendment on Monday, for example, clarified that SB-276 does not intend to ban the transfer of a person to and from federal custody if there is a valid warrant.
“This isn’t a position in cement that I’m not willing to move,” he said. “I want the opportunity to digest these amendments and see if there are any amendments that address potential concerns in the second chamber.”
If the House passes a version of the bill with other amendments, the Senate would need to sign off on those changes before the bill heads to the governor’s desk for a signature.
Republicans argued that the bill interferes with federal policy and impedes legal ICE operations, going against the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. The bill’s passage would likely result in lawsuits, they said.
“This undermines federal immigration enforcement. The bill restricts cooperation between state, local entities and federal immigration authorities, potentially obstructing that of which is the province of the federal government — immigration laws,” said Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, a Monument Republican.
Debate on the bill lasted an entire day last week as Republicans offered amendments that ultimately failed to block it. The bill is likely to face a similarly protracted discussion in the House if chamber leadership decides not to limit the length of debate.

House File 978, passed 84-6, would establish a Psilocybin Production Establishment Licensing Board within the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, operating in a similar fashion to the existing Medical Cannabidiol Advisory Board that oversees Iowa’s medical cannabis program. The board would grant licenses for the production and administration of products with psilocybin to people with certain mental health needs in the state.
The bill also sets new requirements for who can access the substance, including an age 21 restriction and limit of 5,000 patients who can be recommended psilocybin treatment.

Rep. John Wills, R-Spirit Lake, the floor manager for the bill, said he would not have guessed that he would be involved in a bill on psilocybin before this year because “it’s just not something that I’m into.” But he said after learning more about the effectiveness of psilocybin treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, he believed the program will help people suffering in Iowa, like military veterans, law enforcement officers and other groups that face high rates of PTSD.
He said the bill requires people to receive psilocybin in a clinical environment with psychiatric support. In this environment, he said, the drug has been shown to allow people to “relive” their trauma in a controlled, safe space, and be able to resolve or lessen the impacts of PTSD. Wills said he believes this method could help address the high suicide rates of veterans and others suffering from the disorder, and offers a better alternative to other forms of PTSD treatment currently available.
“I will tell you, right now the only option these veterans have, the only option these people with PTSD have, is to be on mind-altering, life-altering drugs for the rest of their life,” Wills said.
While several states have decriminalized the use of psilocybin, Oregon and Colorado are currently the only states with medical psilocybin programs.
Rep. Larry McBurney, D-Urbandale, said he supported the bill as a way to help veterans access needed mental health support after returning from their service. McBurney said he was diagnosed with PTSD after serving as an Iowa Air National Guard veteran, having been deployed three times.
“Like many other veterans across the state and across the nation, I didn’t know where to turn,” McBurney said. “I didn’t know what options were available to me, and it took me long enough to find what those options were for myself and what worked for me. I want to ensure that other veterans across the state have this option available to them.”
The original bill specifically called for psilocybin to be used to treat PTSD, but an amendment approved by the House Monday expands the ability of the board to approve other illnesses that could be treated with psilocybin, and would allow for more psilocybin compounds to be added as legally available.
Wills said the amendment was added as a way to ensure the board can make this psychiatric treatment available for other mental illnesses or disorders when research can prove if it is effective. Wills said there have been “promising” early studies showing psilocybin may be an effective treatment for people recovering from substance use disorders related to alcohol and opiates.
“By taking PTSD out of the equation, what we’re doing is we’re allowing that board, that medical board, to be able to make decisions,” Wills said. “So initially, of course, PTSD is the treatment that we know works, because there’s peer-reviewed studies or peer-reviewed data. But as these other ailments, these other things (are studied) and have proof, then the board can add them.”
Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Birmingham, has advocated for similar measures related to the legal use of psilocybin in previous sessions.
“(It) looks like mushroom season has officially arrived in Iowa,” he joked as the bill passed the House. “Our love and prayers are with everyone pursuing the elusive morel mushrooms, but perhaps more urgently, our love and prayers are with those suffering from intractable psychiatric conditions.”
He praised the measure as opening up a new method for mental health care in Iowa that has shown “tremendous promise” in the management of psychiatric conditions like PTSD.
“The state of Iowa has a lot of responsibility in ensuring Iowans not only have access to mental health treatments, but they have access to treatments that are actually effective — treatments that will actually alleviate the symptoms that patients are suffering from,” Shipley said. “And so again, House File 978, will go a long way in ensuring that the state of Iowa is fully fulfilling their obligation.”

(Photo by Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)Drought, lawsuits and federal funding for New Mexico’s largest river will be some of the topics discussed at the Rio Grande Compact Commission’s annual governance meeting this week.
A three-member governing board representing New Mexico, Colorado and Texas, the Commission convenes in Alamosa, Colorado on Friday for an annual meeting that will include: an annual report of how water flowed between the states; the budget for the upcoming year; reports from federal agencies on issues including endangered species and dam repairs; and an update in the case before the U.S. Supreme Court over Rio Grande water.


How to watch
The meeting will be livestreamed starting at 9 a.m. at the following link: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89726541298
The meeting agenda can be found online here.


New Mexico is facing a future with 25% less water due to climate change and continuing drought, Chris Shaw, a legal advisor to the commission and deputy general counsel at the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, told Source. The whole basin will feel the impacts of smaller snowpacks, he noted, and efforts to cut water use in agriculture and in cities may still not make up the difference.
“This year is going to be particularly difficult,” Shaw said. “Not everybody is going to get all of the water that they need or want, and that puts strains on the social, hydrologic and political fabric here.”
As for the pending Rio Grande legal case, Bobby Skov, the commissioner appointed to represent Texas, told Source he expects a limited update, as a judge recently scheduled a June court date for the case, while parties continue settlement talks.
“The parties are in mediation, so there’s probably not going to be any in-detail type updates, just a quick overview of the case,” he said.
In addition to water concerns and presentations from federal officials, the commission also has some necessary housekeeping to replace a for a replacement of a non-voting member. of the commission.
Friday’s meeting will be the last for long-time chair Hal Simpson, a former Colorado state engineer, appointed by the Obama administration.
Shaw said the commission will discuss the recommendation for former New Mexico State Engineer Scott Verhines to take the spot, but that the position is ultimately a presidential appointment.
Friday will also be New Mexico State Engineer Elizabeth Anderson’s first meeting as a commissioner representing the state, following Mike Hamman’s retirement last year. Anderson was unavailable for comment Monday.
Skov encouraged the public to watch the meeting.
“The Rio Grande is vitally important to all three states,” he told Source NM in a call. “Having the public involved, educated in what’s going on, is better for everyone.
Pueblos seek direct representation 
A six-pueblo coalition — Cochiti, Santo Domingo, San Felipe, Santa Ana, Sandia and Isleta — is again requesting to address Rio Grande Compact commissioners directly, rather than through the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. The coalition first made the request in 2022, and last year, the commission ordered the legal advisors to examine the issue.
Josh Mann, a Pueblo water rights attorney, said coalition members are still seeking a change to the rules of the commission.
“They’re really just asking for a process to communicate,” Mann said. “The Rio Grande Compact has a big impact on the Pueblos’ water use, and as sovereign nations, they’re looking for that communication and to be recognized.”
Juan Rey Abeita, the 2nd lieutenant governor for the Pueblo of Isleta, and a member of the coalition, will likely make a statement on Friday, Mann said.
The Pueblos have unique water rights. In 1928, the U.S. recognized the Pueblos’ “prior and paramount” rights to water through a total 20,000 acres of Pueblo land.
There’s still been no formal determination of water rights in the Middle Rio Grande, although the Pueblos and federal government took initial steps in 2022.
Shaw, the commission’s legal advisor,  said the commission’s official position remains unchanged at this time.
“The position the compact commission takes is that the Pueblos [do] have representation through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and that’s the proper process for them to provide their input,” Shaw said.
However, Shaw said legal advisors are still developing a more expansive protocol for additional tribal input during the Rio Grande Compact Commission meetings.
“If there’s a protocol, it needs to include all the pueblos, tribes and nations, not just the six Middle Rio Grande” Shaw said. “We’ve discussed that with them, so we’re working on a process for this summer to convene that larger group.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota educational options are set to expand as House lawmakers advanced a private school voucher bill Monday and the governor signed a bill establishing public charter schools.
The House in a 49-43 vote agreed to changes made by the Senate to House Bill 1540, which establishes Education Savings Accounts for private school students.
The bill will now go to Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s desk for his signature or veto. If signed into law, the new private school vouchers would be available for the 2026-27 school year.
Armstrong also signed a bill Monday that establishes the framework to implement public charter schools in North Dakota.
“Expanding school choice is a win-win for North Dakota families and for our state’s workforce and long-term success,” Armstrong said in a statement. “The public charter schools authorized by this bill can drive innovation, improve student outcomes and increase parent satisfaction.”
House passes bill authorizing charter schools in North Dakota

Lawmakers have been fairly split on bills related to Education Savings Accounts. House Bill 1540, which passed the Senate last week on a 27-20 vote, only benefits families with children attending private school. 
As amended, the bill provides private school vouchers in an amount that varies depending on household income. Students from families in the lowest income category could receive about $4,000 per year, while students from the highest income category could receive a little over $1,000 per year. 
The bill is estimated to cost about $20 million in the first year, though the exact amount will depend on how many students use the vouchers. The state projects that about 8,000 students will attend North Dakota private schools in 2026-27, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill.
House Majority Leader Rep. Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, who voted in favor of the bill, said it allows parents to shape the educational futures of their children.
North Dakota Senate passes Education Savings Accounts for private school students

“Beyond academics, House Bill 1540 ensures equality,” Lefor said. “Parents know their children best. It’s not the government, but families who should have the final say in their children’s education.”
Rep. Liz Conmy, D-Fargo, voted against the bill and told lawmakers the North Dakota Constitution prohibits the use of public school tax dollars to support a sectarian school.
“We are obligated, constitutionally, to fund and strengthen public schools and specifically directed to not subsidize private education,” Conmy said. “We don’t get to pick and choose what part of the constitution we want to go with or not.”
A competing Senate Education Savings Account bill, Senate Bill 2400, proposed to benefit public school and homeschooled students in addition to private school students. It passed the Senate but received a do-not-pass recommendation by the House Education Committee in March. The bill has not been forwarded for a full chamber vote.
Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, chief sponsor of the Senate bill, prepared an amendment to her Education Savings Account bill Monday for a House Education Committee hearing. She sought to introduce an amendment to remove the private school portion of her bill and advance an Education Savings Account of $500 for educational expenses for public school and homeschooled students.
However, committee members denied a motion to reconsider the bill. It will advance to full chamber.
After the committee hearing, Axtman said the bill that passed the House is leaving out a “key component” of school choice – public school students. She said she also worries about rural students with limited choices because new charter schools probably won’t make their way into deeply rural areas. 
“I think we are missing a huge segment of choice for those students,” Axtman said. “I’ve always from day one been a supporter of a universal program that is truly universal so I’m disappointed we couldn’t get there.”
Armstrong recommended $44.3 million in his preliminary budget in January for a potential Education Savings Account program that would cover public, private and homeschooled students. 
North Dakota United, a union representing public school teachers and other state employees, opposes Education Savings Accounts. Nick Archuleta, president of North Dakota United, said the private school vouchers will only benefit a small selection of North Dakota students.
“I think the governor is going to look long and hard at it and, ultimately, the voters will,” Archuleta said. “We don’t believe it provides school choice. We believe that it’s the school’s choice to educate whom they choose to educate in that particular bill, so we weren’t in favor of that bill and still aren’t.”

The measure (SB 1242) sponsored by North Central Florida Republican Stan McClain, originally would have prohibited creation of any new CRAs, but he said that after receiving input from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers he would agree to allow them.
“CRAs may continue to operate under their redevelopment plan but must sunset on the termination date outlined in those plans,” McClain said Monday in introducing the change. “No extensions will be permitted. The original intent was for CRAs to have lifespans of approximately 40 years, and this amendment aims to re-align with that original vision.”
Since 1969, Florida cities and countries have been empowered by state law to create CRAs in districts designated as “blighted areas.” They are funded by tax revenues collected in those specific districts through what is known as tax increment financing (TIF). TIF funds collected from a specific CRA are then invested back into that specific area.
There are more than 200 such CRAs in the state at the moment (Tampa has eight).
There has been a push by some lawmakers to kill CRAs because of reports that they have misappropriated funds. To answer those concerns, the bill prohibits CRAs from extending their boundaries or spending on events such as concerts, festivals, holiday events, parades, “focusing CRAs on tangible brick and mortar redevelopment efforts,” McClain said.
That language is important, said North Florida Republican Corey Simon.
“I think the warning should be for our CRAs to operate and do what they’re supposed to be doing,” he said. “Those dollars were for blighted areas, not to put on concerts and not to put on things that are not targeting those blighted areas. And so I think the warning shot needs to be that our CRAs need to be operating to improve these communities that have been set aside.”
The amended bill requires that either city council members or county commissioners must be the same representatives legislating over the CRA. It also says that all CRAs in existence as of Oct. 1, 2019, will end at the termination date  already listed in the respective CRA’s charter.
Speaking on behalf of keeping CRAs was Panama City Beach Mayor Stuart Tettemer, who noted that his city is one of the few in the state that doesn’t collect ad valorem taxes. “Our CRA keeps taxes local and efficient,” he said. “Keep our town affordable for visitors and our residents.”
McClain’s bill now heads to the full Senate for a vote. A companion bill (HB 991) in the House sponsored by Cape Coral Republican Mike Giallombardo still has a committee stop before reaching the floor of that chamber.

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Despite the Senate’s seemingly renewed focus earlier this year on curtailing drunken driving deaths, the effort is again being pushed to next year.
Bi-partisan legislation that aims to close the loopholes allowing people to escape convictions for driving under the influence won’t even reach the Senate floor before the 2025 session ends next month. After postponing debate on the bill at multiple meetings, the Senate Judiciary Committee decided last week to carry it over until 2026.
“It may be something that we have to make a big push for in January of ’26 as opposed to May of ’25,” said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, who sits on the full Judiciary Committee but wasn’t on the panel that advanced the bill in March. “I’m frustrated by that, but I think that’s where we are.”
In 2022, 474 people died in South Carolina as a result of drunken driving, ranking the state fifth highest nationwide in total numbers and the worst rate by population. The tally represents a 72% increase since 2019, according to a July 2024 report by South Carolina’s chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
“The designation of worst state in the nation for drunk driving is clear,” the report reads.
Part of the problem is the state’s video requirements. By law, officers must start recording as soon as they turn on their blue lights. And recordings must include the entirety of field sobriety tests, arrests, breath tests, and suspects being advised of their Miranda rights, which start with the right to remain silent.
Any technicality — such as faulty audio that causes the Miranda rights not being heard, video that’s too dark, or somebody’s feet not being captured on camera — can lead to a case being tossed, according to proponents for changing the law, who include solicitors, sheriffs and victims’ advocates.
The proposal — lawmakers’ latest attempt at making the roads safer — would, among other things, change state law so that the video can be less than perfect. Under the bill, evidence could be suppressed if the officer fails to “substantially comply” with video recording requirements, to include “reasonably” documenting officers advising suspects of their rights.
Solicitors have been pushing for legislation de-emphasizing video in DUI cases for a decade.
“There are so many loopholes in our drunk driving laws that it’s very difficult for solicitors to successfully prosecute those cases,” said Sen. Tom Davis, R-Beaufort, the bill’s lead sponsor.
Tougher DUI law meant to curb drunk driving in SC takes effect Sunday

His bill could bring the biggest changes to South Carolina’s DUI laws since 2008, when the Legislature passed legislation escalating penalties for higher alcohol concentrations and for multiple convictions. Passage came after then-Gov. Mark Sanford publicly accused senators of blocking the bill in a YouTube video featuring a South Carolina mom whose 5-year-old son was killed by a drunken driver.
A 2014 law required repeat offenders or first-time offenders who had a blood alcohol level of more than 0.15 to install ignition interlock devices, which prevent someone who has been drinking alcohol from starting the vehicle. A 2023 law that took effect last May expanded the requirement to anyone convicted of a DUI, no matter how high their blood alcohol level.
But, according to those pushing for change, getting a conviction is tough. In the past, defense attorneys have argued DUI cases aren’t pleaded down or dismissed due to video technicalities nearly as often as advocates for change suggest. And no agency kept track to prove it either way.
Between January 2019 and March 2024, MADD monitored the courts in seven large South Carolina counties: Berkeley, Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Lexington, Richland, and Spartanburg. In those seven counties, the conviction rate on first-offense misdemeanor DUI cases ranged from a low of 18% in Richland County to a high of 65% in Spartanburg County. Whether cases were dropped altogether or pleaded down to something else, often reckless driving, varied by county.
“Clearly, South Carolina falls behind most of the nation,” MADD concluded.
“We have got to address it and make sure we address it right,” Sen. Brian Adams, a co-sponsor of the bill, told the SC Daily Gazette.
The bill would also create enhanced penalties for DUI wrecks that cause “moderate bodily injury,” such as a bone fracture or dislocation. Under existing law, people can be charged with felony DUI only if they cause “great bodily injury” or death. The proposal would also increase penalties for convictions and for refusing to take a breath test.
“I thought we had a good bill,” said Laura Hudson, the executive director of the South Carolina Crime Victims Council.
Hudson, who has been advocating at the Statehouse for crime victims for more than four decades, said she was disappointed the bill didn’t get traction this year.
“It’s not like they didn’t have the time,” she said, noting the Senate bill was pre-filed in December for this year’s session.
She’s hopeful senators will keep their pledge to make it a top priority for 2026. Since this is the first of a two-year session, the bill does not need to be reintroduced.
Steven Burritt, the state director for MADD, said it’s a letdown that the bill he considers a game changer for DUI in South Carolina won’t pass this year. If more people are held accountable, South Carolina will be a safer place to drive, he said.
“I think all these things are connected,” Burritt told the SC Daily Gazette. “If we make the law easier to prosecute and enforce, I think we’ll hold people accountable for their actions. They’ll get more of the penalties that actually reduce the likelihood that it’ll happen again, and I think that is a very reasonable cause and effect that should lead to safer roads.”
If the Legislature truly passes a bill next year, the wait will have been worth it, he said.
“If the right bill gets passed for DUI reform, I’ll gladly wait until 2026,” he said. However, he added, he’s concerned the motivation will dissipate by January.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/car-theft-1024x683-1-1.jpg,,,2025-04-21 19:05:35.848576

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas City suburb rose to the top in a major e-commerce company’s nationwide search for a new hub through hefty property tax incentives.
Fortune 500 company Fiserv plans to open a new location in Overland Park, the Kansas governor’s office announced Monday, touting the addition of 2,000 job and a 10-year, $6.5 billion economic impact.
Gov. Laura Kelly’s office called the deal the largest office recruitment in the state’s history.
Frank Bisignano, chairman and CEO of Fiserv, said the planned Overland Park hub is an opportunity to expand the company’s footprint in the U.S. and foster innovation in the financial services field on behalf of its clients.
“The greater Kansas City metro area offers a dynamic environment with a growing population of tech talent, making it the ideal location for Fiserv’s next strategic fintech hub,” he said.
The company’s announcement came less than a week after Overland Park’s Finance, Administration and Economic Development Committee unanimously gave preliminary approval for a property tax rebate program for a “Project Turtle,” which has been connected to Fiserv.
The Overland Park City Council is set to take up the issue Monday, but the project has already earned Mayor Curt Skoog’s unofficial approval.
“This is the biggest job-creating project that we’ve worked on in my time,” he said at the economic development committee’s Wednesday meeting.
In Skoog’s 20 years of involvement with the city, he said, he has witnessed significant growth successes and attractive additions to the community
“But this one is a really, really amazing win for us,” he said.
If approved, Project Turtle would receive a rebate on city, county and Blue Valley Recreation Commission property taxes. The company would pay full property taxes to the Blue Valley School District and the Johnson County Community College levies.
Under the rebate agreement, taxes will be paid, and then the company would submit an application to the city to be reimbursed for about 40% of those taxes, or an estimated $1.3 million over 10 years of the company’s 15-year lease.
But the rebate is contingent on meeting certain conditions.
Those conditions include a $125 million investment in renovations and improvements and maintaining 2,000 full-time employees by 2030. The governor’s office said those employees will earn an average salary of $102,000 annually. The state anticipates Fiserv will contribute up to $4 billion in payroll investment over the next decade.
 The company also would be required to participate in community engagement, invest in memberships with the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce and the Overland Park Economic Development Council and commit to using Overland Park hotels and facilities for conventions and meetings.
The governor’s office said Fiserv has committed $175 million for the project but neither the office nor the Kansas Department of Commerce answered questions about the project’s total cost or if state funds will be pledged.
The economic development committee liked the idea of reusing existing space and increasing the long-term property value at the 200-acre Aspiria campus, which was considered at one point for a new location for the Kansas City Royals. After Sprint sold the campus in 2019, it was envisioned as a live-work-play environment tailored to businesses and entrepreneurs. It’s one of the largest corporate campuses in the U.S., second only to Microsoft’s campus in Washington state.
Fiserv is expected to lease two buildings on the campus, totaling 427,000 square feet.
The tax incentives are an “important component” of the deal, said Alex Leath, an Alabama attorney with the international law firm Bradley Arant who helped bring Panasonic to De Soto.
The Kansas City area wasn’t initially a contender for Fiserv, Leath said.
“What I saw first and foremost — what I do see — is the quality of the people, the work ethic of the people,” Leath told the economic development committee. “This is a company that expects people to be in the office five days a week … and Kansans struck me as people who would enjoy that, or embrace that.”
Overland Park beat out Nashville, Phoenix, Dallas, Fort Worth, Atlanta and the South Florida area in the company’s search.
The governor said the new hub is making good on her administration’s promise to “modernize and diversify” the state’s economy.
“Fiserv’s new strategic hub in Overland Park is a significant step forward as we continue to elevate Kansas to new heights,” Kelly said. “Fiserv will create high-value career options, including opportunities for military personnel transitioning to civilian life and graduates of our higher education system.”
Fiserv chose Overland Park, the announcement said, because of its central location in the United States, proximity to clients in the Midwest, affordable cost of living and the opportunity to recruit talent in the tech field.
Tim Cowden, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council, called the investment “monumental.”
He added: “And so is the Kansas City region’s ability to deliver.”
The Kansas City area has the capacity and competitiveness to rise to the occasion, he said, which he attributed to a “fast-growing tech sector,” a cache of talent and a prosperous, collaborative business community.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/P7130627-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-21 18:11:50.963633

But while Gov. Glenn Youngkin and federal partners hailed the operation as a national model, some researchers and critics warn that the data used to justify such crackdowns often paints an incomplete — and potentially misleading — picture.
Launched through a partnership between the U.S. Department of Justice and Virginia, the VHSTF is a sprawling initiative involving more than 200 officers from agencies including the FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Virginia State Police and the Department of Corrections, among others.
The task force has made 521 arrests to date, according to Youngkin’s office. Of those, 132 individuals were identified as gang-affiliated, including members of MS-13 and Tren de Aragua.
“Thanks to the brave men and women of our federal and state law enforcement, more than 500 criminal illegal immigrants, including more than 130 gang-members, are off of Virginia’s streets and facing justice for their crimes,” Youngkin said in a statement Monday. “All Virginians should be proud. … What’s happening in Virginia is a model that should be replicated all across the country.”
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi echoed that sentiment, calling the effort “the product of unprecedented collaboration” between state and federal law enforcement and praising the Youngkin administration’s alignment with President Donald Trump’s “Make America Safe Again” agenda.
FBI Director Kash Patel said the task force’s early results had been “a tremendous success,” while ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons highlighted the expansion of ICE’s controversial 287(g) program in Virginia. 
That program, which allows state and local officials to enforce federal immigration law, was authorized in Virginia through Executive Order 47, signed by Youngkin on Feb. 27 and approved by ICE within 20 hours — a turnaround the governor’s office touted as a record.
Yet amid the political fanfare, some experts say the celebratory tone doesn’t align with the broader data.
A 2024 report funded by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) found that undocumented immigrants are arrested at significantly lower rates than U.S.-born citizens. 
The study, which examined six years of Texas criminal records between 2012 and 2018 that included verified immigration status, found that undocumented immigrants were arrested at less than half the rate of native-born Americans for violent and drug crimes, and at only a quarter of the rate for property crimes.
“The question of how often undocumented immigrants commit crimes is not easy to answer,” the study’s authors wrote, noting that arrest rates often reflect law enforcement priorities rather than actual crime rates. 
Still, their data showed that native-born citizens had the highest offending rates across most felony categories, with undocumented immigrants consistently showing the lowest.
The findings challenge an unproven core assumption underlying the rhetoric around initiatives like the VHSTF — that undocumented immigrants pose an outsized threat to public safety.
Virginia Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Terry Cole, however, called the task force’s approach “a proven model” for tackling transnational criminal threats. 
“The significant number of arrests and ongoing investigations highlight the effectiveness of a collaborative approach to complex enforcement challenges,” Cole said.
But critics argue that such high-profile sweeps often overstate the role of immigration status in violent crime — and underplay the potential for racial profiling and civil rights violations when local law enforcement is deputized to enforce federal immigration laws.
For now, VHSTF operations are expected to continue, with law enforcement agencies conducting long-term investigations into narcotics trafficking, organized crime and gang-related violence.

The report, covering April 14 through April 20, shows Iowa has 68% of oats planted, 18% of corn and 11% of soybeans. Planting rates for all three of these crops are ahead of the five-year average. 
Topsoil and subsoil moisture conditions improved slightly from the week prior, though both have more than 60% rated as adequate moisture. Soil moisture conditions are slightly better than last year at this time. 
Soil temperatures measured at a depth of four inches show the ground has warmed up, with most counties measuring in the upper 40s to low 50s. Other field activities for the period included tiling, building waterways and spraying. 

Iowa crop progress and condition reports are released weekly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service during planting season and through harvest season. 

Average precipitation for April 14-20 was 0.35 inches across the state, though several areas measured more than an inch and up to nearly 2.5 inches following thunderstorms April 17. 
Some counties observed hail as large as 4 inches during the storms and two tornadoes touched down, one in Fremont County near Tabor, and the other moved across Fremont and Page counties. 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, hail and wind damage was reported in Sioux City, Storm Lake and Waverly, in addition to the counties that saw tornadoes. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation, in response to the severe weather, for Buena Vista, Fremont, Page, and Plymouth counties. The proclamation opens up state resources to respond to the damages and gives eligible Iowans 45 days to apply for the Iowa Individual Assistance Grant Program to help with associated repairs and other costs.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig visited some of areas hit by the storms. 
“I visited southwest Iowa over the weekend, where I saw firsthand some of the damage caused by the tornadoes and large hail,” Naig said in a statement. “My heart goes out to all the Iowans who were impacted by these storms.” 
Precipitation predictions for the coming week suggest Iowa will have above average rainfall across most of the state, which Naig said might slow spring planting progress as it did the week prior. 
“While more delays may occur, the rain will help replenish soil moisture, which would be a welcome development in many areas,” Naig said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-21 22:02:04+00:00,CT Mirror,Why CT special education funding bills are dividing advocates,Jessika Harkay,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/21/ct-special-education-funding-bills/,The controversial bills would change how Connecticut’s private special education programs are funded and may bill for services.,"Special education advocates are split on whether two proposed bills are the best steps forward in tackling concerns about the quality of student services, cost and accountability.
Leaders of the Select Committee on Special Education described House Bill 7277 and Senate Bill 1561 at a news conference Monday morning as “a historical way for Connecticut” to pay for special education and make the school systems and their services more equitable for students with disabilities.
“Through this bill, we make sure that special education is real and not just on paper and not just in certain communities — that special education for students with special needs, and all learning needs, is equal and accessible in any district that you live in,” said Committee Co-chair Rep. Maryam Khan, D-Windsor. 
Her fellow co-chair Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Trumbull, added that special education is “at a point” where it’s “not sustainable, and we need to have better oversight.”
“Part of what the bill will do is to provide us the oversight and the data that we don’t currently have, to understand why costs are what they are, why we’ve seen a continuing rise in costs and what we can do to help maintain those costs while always maintaining a commitment to our students,” Gadkar-Wilcox said Monday.
Not everyone was so optimistic. Even other lawmakers on the committee had reservations about the bills Monday and said they needed more work, time and revisions in certain sections to ensure they didn’t have unintended consequences.
“We have to be very careful what we do here, because this will have a long-term impact on our children, not just the ones in school today but the ones in school tomorrow and the ones in school decades from now,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, a member of the select committee and co-chair of the state legislature’s Appropriations Committee.
Cost changes
The two omnibus bills each contain more than 50 sections and 60 pages, with several provisions that would require more oversight from the Office of Policy and Management and would change how private special education programs are funded and may bill for services.
The bills would prohibit any tuition raises for private special education providers in the 2025-26 academic year and would pause the opening of any new programs until 2027, a change that generated some fierce pushback.
But the bills also would require OPM and the state Department of Education to “collect and analyze the tuition, rates and other fees for special education” when students are outsourced from their home school district and then create what they believe are appropriate fixed costs for services.
Establishing those fixed costs would involve “establishing a universal special education and related services rate schedule” that would include “an individualized rate for each special education service provided to a student pursuant to an individualized education program and standards for how a charging entity may include its operating expenses into the total costs for services charged to a local or regional board of education,” according to House Bill 7277.
Connecticut public schools spend nearly $2.7 billion annually on special education services. For some districts, special education costs make up a significant portion of their budgets. For example, in Hartford, which educates more than 4,000 students with disabilities, about 33% of its total education budget, or around $151 million, goes toward special education, Mayor Arunan Arulampalam said Monday.
“Of that $151 million, $80 million is in tuition and $22.8 million is just in transportation of special ed students,” Arulampalam said in support of the bill. “Less than a third of our special ed costs are being spent on in-district special ed services for Hartford Public School students, and that number is ballooning.”
Advocates supporting the bill include the Connecticut Education Association, the largest teacher’s union in the state, and local superintendents and municipal leaders from across the state.
“When the city of Hartford comes, and other cities like us come to you, it’s not asking for a handout,” Arulampalam said. “It is an ask for a partnership to work together to create a strong foundation for our students and to create a better and stronger state in the future. I think this bill creates a pathway toward that, both with funding the short term … but also, importantly, a real structural impact by capping the cost of outplacement services.”
Hundreds opposed
But more than 700 written statements were submitted opposing the bill and tuition caps. Many who opposed the bill, whether in writing or at the public hearing Monday, were parents, special education lawyers and some lawmakers who were on the committee.
“This is not a good bill, or at least, needs a tremendous amount of work,” said Andrew Feinstein, a longtime special education attorney and legislative chair for the advocacy group Special Education Equity for Kids of Connecticut. “There are some good sections, which we support, but by and large, this effort to destroy private providers, which is absolutely what this bill will do, is just unacceptable.”
Feinstein also served as a tri-chair on the Task Force to Study Special Education Services and Funding, which was convened in 2021 by state statue, and presented its findings and recommendations earlier this year. 
On Monday, he said the committee’s effort to impose fixed special education rates would “destroy private programs” and in turn cause great harm to the state’s students with the most severe disabilities.
“The critical fact is that we need these placements as a part of the continuum of educational placements. Many have long waiting lists. For example, Hubbard North, which opened recently in Rocky Hill, has 20 enrolled students and a waiting list of 50. It takes time, money and staff to build up capacity,” Feinstein wrote in his testimony. “District special education directors do not lightly outplace students. They do so when there is no way that the student can be educated within the district. There can be no doubt that this bill, if enacted, would reduce the number of slots for disabled students to be outplaced. A rate schedule, designed to reduce costs, will convince many operators that the income available from tuition and fees is insufficient to cover costs and [will] close up shop.”
Osten agreed at the public hearing. She said staff members, like paraeducators in public school districts, often make minimum wage and that she hopes the proposed legislation is “not saying that we want to get those outplacement schools to a level that we’re giving them minimum wage to take care of those kids.”
“When we talk about capping programs and monitoring expenses, I worry about what we think is the right things to do — by having the Office of Policy Management oversee some of these things and come up with a plan in a short timeframe,” Osten said, adding that in the 1980s and ’90s, a similar initiative resulted in the closure of education programs.
“Back then, we said, ‘We are not going to fund these types of [special education] programs,’ and programs that were successful for my family are no longer in business anymore,” Osten said, referring to her family’s personal experience navigating special education systems decades ago. “They went out of business a long time ago.”
Grants
In another effort to help local municipalities with special education costs, the two bills propose at least three state-funded grants, including a “special education offset grant,” another that would provide $50 million in transportation reimbursement and a third that would give additional funding for districts to expand or improve in-district or regional special education programming.
Gov. Ned Lamont recently supported funding for more in-district programming, allotting $14 million in his proposed budget for a grant program to help districts develop ways to educate more students with disabilities in-district rather than sending them to private programs outside the district. 
And while the bills proposed special license plates to raise money for special education costs, it’s uncertain whether that would be enough to fully fund the grant programs.
Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker strongly opposed the bills and said the state Department of Education didn’t have the capacity or resources to carry out the grant proposals. 
“We believe that there are sections of this proposal that the department can support, however, there are many that we cannot,” Russell-Tucker said in written testimony.
The special education offset grant alone would cost the state Department of Education approximately $190 million, Russell-Tucker said, “not including the 14 additional full-time employees we are estimating that we will need to carry out the work of the entire bill proposal, none of which are included in the governor’s budget.”
In testimony, some supported increasing state support for special education through these grant programs, but some stakeholders also wondered whether they were feasible.
“We’re totally for this offset grant, but where’s the money coming from?” Feinstein said at the public hearing. “We know that this isn’t happening. This is another shell game that the legislature loves to play.”
“My thoughts exactly,” said Rep. Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect, a ranking member of the Education Committee and member of the Select Committee on Special Education, in response to Feinstein’s criticism. “Where is all the money coming from for this piece of legislation?”
Possible parent support
Parents navigating the special education system have consistently referred to it as a “battlefield,” full of legal and educational jargon and uncertainty about the full extent of rights.
The legislation offers extra support to families by proposing the creation of an educational ombudsperson that would be tasked with:

Receiving, reviewing and solving complaints from students and their families;
Gathering and analyzing data “on students and young people” to help public agencies and lawmakers develop policy;
Assisting student loan borrowers understand their rights and responsibilities;
Analyzing implementation of federal, state and local laws.

The bills also calls on the state Department of Education to work to simplify Individualized Education Program forms and create a parent guide on special education rights and timelines.
The proposals will be taken up for vote by the Select Committee on Special Education Friday.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/thumbnail_IMG_7737-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-21 18:11:50.963633

(Getty Images)Years ago, when I worked as a newspaper opinion editor, a conservative reader sent a letter to argue that 21st-century America was a post-racial society. I don’t recall the details of his email except that his case was built around individual accomplishment, particularly the success of Black entertainers (including Bill Cosby) and the election and reelection of President Barack Obama.
His point, no doubt in response to something I had either published or written myself, was that structural racism — to the extent it ever existed — most certainly did not exist now.
I’m not sure how I responded exactly, but I do remember being baffled by the evidence he offered for his conclusion. To arrive at “post-racial society” via Cosby and Obama seemed both absurd and dangerous — a reductionist presentation of recent history, yes, but also a stubborn refusal to seek out the realities of other eyes.
And I’m not even talking about empathy — that’s like the advanced course. I mean just seeing through the experiences of others that there is not one America, that this nation exists differently for different people, and that opportunity is not a single, shared thread. 
While we have struggled mightily as a nation to even chip away at yawning opportunity gaps — not just for Black and Indigenous people but women, immigrants, the working poor, the list goes on and on — historically there seemed to me, naively as it turns out, to at least be agreement that the gaps existed. The frequent and sometimes violent conflict over that reality and its causes could be offered as ample proof, I thought. But now, an entire political party has built its brand on denialism and erasure — and found in its followers a population more than willing to sacrifice their future if it means the relief of forgetting the past and averting their eyes from the present.
My letter writer from years ago wasn’t a fringe anomaly but a harbinger. 
The most obvious example nationally is the Trump administration’s carpet-bombing of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and the countless ways those attacks have rippled out and laid waste to lives and livelihoods. Meanwhile, New Hampshire is mimicking the efforts and with the same toe-deep understanding of what purpose the programs actually serve. In one memorable February exchange, Auburn Republican Rep. Jess Edwards had to talk down fellow Republican Rep. Mike Belcher from his superficial hatred of the Department of Health and Human Services’ “Office of Health Equity,” which Belcher had targeted for elimination.
“The word ‘health equity’ has jumped out at me as well,” Edwards told Belcher sympathetically during a hearing for the since-retained bill. “I think we’ve got a situation where whoever came up with the name of that department really regrets it, because they couldn’t forecast how the name would basically become synonymous with actual discrimination.”
Truly, how could anyone have predicted that the Republican Party would successfully sell its supporters on the idea that “equity” is synonymous with its antonym?
This is the same genre of illogic and enforced ignorance that has given New Hampshire its “divisive concepts” law, the subject of a legal battle now being fought in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. Although part of the legal problem with the law is that it’s overly (and purposely) vague — an extension of the first Trump administration’s “critical race theory” mass hallucination — the goal was and is to make teachers afraid to tackle the uglier, less “shining city on a hill” chapters of America’s past and present. 
But why? 
Why is the modern Republican Party so invested in reframing American history, which they are accomplishing through educator threats and a transparent effort to make “equity” and “inclusion” mean their opposites? What is it that links the party’s stop-teaching-about-slavery Project 1776 to the implementation of its anti-democratic, pro-wealthy Project 2025.
Those are the questions you have to ask. 
“History is not inert,” Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in Vanity Fair last year, “but contains within it a story that implicates the present.”
And that, eloquently, is the answer. 
Nothing is more dangerous to the powers behind a nation as historically unequal as our own than to have the citizens start asking the right questions of the right people. 
But with the pitchfork mobs so blindly dedicated to the eradication of all things DEI and “divisive concepts,” the powers needn’t worry. In Donald Trump’s America, we’re a million miles away from the right questions. 
And that, as any right-wing politician can tell you, is and always was the point.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/usaoath-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-21 18:11:50.963633

Rep. Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, D-Ames, said she’s seen this bill many times during her tenure as a lawmaker, and current law allowing courts to order payment for postsecondary education is not equitable. Married parents and parents who never married get to have the choice of how their child’s college will be paid for, but right now those going through a divorce have no choice.
“I am concerned about the rising cost of an education for our young people and taking away one option for them to get paid, but it needs to be done equitably, and therefore I support the bill and recommend a yes vote,” Wessel-Kroeschell said.
Floor manager Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, agreed with Wessel-Kroeschell in his closing comments, saying it is “not acceptable” that a judge gets to decide if a parent will help pay for college instead of the parents themselves if they’re going through a divorce.
“I would also mention that different parents have different philosophies regarding what should be paid for once their children become young adults, and how that is handled,” Holt said. “So I don’t think it’s appropriate that a court put that upon parents going through a divorce.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout © 2025)Tennessee’s legislature put the state’s private-prison operator on notice to keep death rates down or face a reduction in inmates, a move that could cut its state payments.
House members voted 93-0 Monday in favor of House Bill 1144 by Republican Rep. Clark Boyd of Lebanon, which would require the inmate population at each CoreCivic-run prison to be reduced 10% if the death rate there is twice as high as the rate at a comparable state-run prison. The Senate previously approved its version of the bill, sponsored by Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon.
Boyd told lawmakers the bill is designed to bring “accountability to the number of inmate deaths and violence” in Tennessee’s private prisons. Inmates would be “absorbed” by state prisons without an increased cost to the state, he said.
“Just losing 10% of their inmate population would hit them hard financially,” said Boyd, who worked with Lebanon resident Tim Leeper, whose son died of an overdose at privately-run Trousdale Turner.
Tennessee levied $44.78 million in penalties against private prison operator in three years

CoreCivic, a publicly-traded company that runs four state prisons, has struggled to keep its facilities staffed at the level required by state contracts. The Department of Correction penalized CoreCivic numerous times over the last few years, levying $44.78 million in liquidated damages for contractual shortfalls, mainly related to low staffing.
A State Comptroller audit showed Trousdale Turner had a 146% employee turnover rate in 2023, making it harder to oversee inmates. The prison, which is under a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, had a 33.7% staff vacancy rate most recently, compared with 26% at state-run prisons, officials said.
Trousdale Turner has had the highest number of deaths in a state prison for men the past few years, with 98 confirmed by death certificates from 2019 through 2022, including 30 overdoses, according to state figures. Whiteville Correctional Facility in Hardeman County had 53 deaths, 21 of those by overdose, in those four years. South Central Correctional Facility, also run by CoreCivic, reported 46 deaths, nine of them by overdose in that time frame.
In comparison, Morgan County Correctional, a state-run facility, had 41 deaths, including 11 overdoses. Northwest Correctional Facility reported 44 deaths with 19 overdoses in those four years.
Despite the shortcomings, the Department of Correction defends the prison company, calling it a valuable state “partner.” The state has had trouble staffing the remaining 10 prisons, as well.
CoreCivic says prisoner safety, health and well-being are “top priority” and that each facility has an emergency response team to handle medical care. The company also says all prison deaths are reported immediately for investigation.

(Photo by Leah Romero for Source NM)New Mexico’s highest court on Monday clarified a question posed by a federal court about which law to consider when weighing an emergency dispatcher’s legal immunity from allegations of a mishandled 911 call.
The ruling stems from the death of a 16-year-old boy who was hiking with his family in July 2020 in the Organ Mountains in Doña Ana County when he started suffering from heat stroke. His mother called 911, which a Mesilla Valley Regional Dispatch Authority 911 dispatcher answered and then routed to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety.
In a wrongful death lawsuit, the child’s estate and family alleged that the Mesilla Valley dispatcher made a series of missteps that delayed the emergency medical response, and that DPS’ dispatch center incorrectly noted their location that day.
The Mesilla Valley Regional Dispatch Authority and DPS each asked the judge to dismiss the case, pointing to a New Mexico law called the Enhanced 911 Act that provides legal immunity to local governments and their contractors who run 911 dispatch systems “except for intentional acts.”
The federal court delayed a decision to dismiss the case and asked the New Mexico Supreme Court to weigh in.
In a unanimous decision published on Monday, the New Mexico Supreme Court found that the Enhanced 911 Act, “has no bearing on the 911 dispatchers’ immunity from liability for the allegedly mishandled 911 emergency medical calls.”
Instead, the justices wrote, immunity for dispatchers is governed by a law the Legislature passed six years prior to the Enhanced 911 Act: the Enhanced Medical Services Act, which provides immunity for dispatchers except for damages caused by negligence.
“Succinctly stated, important changes in statutory law are not generally made through inconspicuous means,” the justices wrote. “Applying that principle here, we cannot conclude that the Legislature would announce a new rule more broadly immunizing 911 dispatchers from liability except for intentional acts in the space of one phrase in a statute primarily addressing enhanced 911 infrastructure and funding that makes only isolated and generalized references to 911 dispatchers or their equivalents.”
The justices wrote that their ruling is only meant to clarify for the federal court which law to apply; they made no findings as to how it should apply the law to the boy’s death.
Under a new statewide emergency dispatch system expected to launch in August, dispatchers won’t have to rely on callers to determine their location and instead will be able to track the cell phone’s location data.

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The state agency responsible for overseeing the Pell Bridge will need about six months to assess the safety of the bridge connecting Newport to Jamestown should it get hit by a large ship, according to a letter sent to federal transportation officials late last week.
Rhode Island’s suspension bridge was one of 68 bridges flagged by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) for evaluation in March as part of its ongoing investigation of the March 2024 collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge.
Bridges on the NTSB’s list were not necessarily at risk of collapse, but were flagged for review because they were built before the establishment of safety guidelines in 1991. NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy wrote to the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (RITBA) asking the state to develop and implement a comprehensive risk reduction plan. 
The agency had 30 days to send an official response, which RITBA Executive Director Lori Caron Silveira filed Friday. 
Silveira wrote that RITBA has taken initial steps for a risk assessment, including identifying engineering firms with “expertise in vessel strike risk analysis.” The assessment will include an analysis of historic vessel traffic using data collected by the Coast Guard about the vessel, waterway characteristics, navigation procedures, geotechnical and underwater depth measurements, and structural engineering specifications of the bridge. 
A final report is expected to be completed in approximately six months, Silveira wrote.
She wrote that the agency had conducted an internal review to assess the vulnerability of its infrastructure in the immediate aftermath of the Francis Scott Key Bridge’s collapse last spring. Internal research suggests the Pell Bridge is unlikely to be struck by a vessel as large as the one that hit Baltimore’s Key Bridge, according to Silveira.
“The vessels navigating this area are smaller than the container vessel involved in the Key Bridge incident,” Silveira wrote. “Furthermore, existing pilot practices, navigational controls, and the design and construction of the main Pell Bridge piers, which extend approximately 100 to 150 feet below mean high water, constitute additional protective factors.”
If the new vulnerability assessment shows there’s a risk, Silveira said RITBA will work to come up with a safety plan that aligns with federal recommendations.

Josephson have settled a years-long legal battle over Josephson’s comments about how to treat gender dysphoria and the punishment he alleges followed those comments. 
A Monday court document says both parties agreed “this case should be dismissed with prejudice as the parties have settled all claims raised in this litigation.” 
The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a conservative Christian law firm that represented Josephson in his lawsuit against the university, said UofL agreed to pay almost $1.6 million in “damages and attorneys’ fees.”
Fired University of Louisville professor claiming free-speech violation argues for jury trial

A university spokesperson said he could not comment “as this settlement is related to a personnel matter.” 
“After several years, free speech and common sense have scored a major victory on college campuses,” Travis Barham, an ADF lawyer who represented Josephson, said in a statement. “Public universities have no business punishing professors simply because they hold different views.” 
“Hopefully, other public universities will learn from this that if they violate the First Amendment, they can be held accountable, and it can be very expensive,” Barham said. 
Josephson, formerly chief of the UofL medical school’s Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology, made the comments in question during a Heritage Foundation panel discussion in 2017, which his colleagues found to be anti-LGBTQ and “demanded that the University take disciplinary action against” him, according to court filings by Josephson.
Those comments included: 

The “notion that gender identity should trump chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, external genitalia, and secondary sex characteristics when classifying individuals is counter to medical science.”
“Transgender ideology neglects the child’s need for developing coping and problem-solving skills necessary to meet developmental challenges.” 
Parents should “use their collective wisdom in guiding their child to align with his or her biological sex.”

Within seven weeks of the comments, “defendants demanded that he resign his position as division chief and effectively become a junior faculty member,” Josephson alleged in court documents. Josephson was “demoted, harassed, and ultimately fired for speaking out on the harms of ‘transitioning’ children,” his lawyers said.
After Monday’s settlement, Josephson said in a statement “I’m glad to finally receive vindication for voicing what I know is true.”

Over the last few elections, the observation process of elections has become more popular — and more polarizing — as Republicans have grown increasingly skeptical of the election process since President Donald Trump’s baseless allegations of fraud in the 2020 presidential contest. 
The rule, proposed by the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC), provides more detail for what observers are allowed to do and where they are allowed to position themselves at polling places, and lays out the process for how an unruly observer can be removed. The rule’s final text was created with input from an advisory committee consisting of representatives of major and minor political parties, election clerks, disability rights groups and right-wing election conspiracy groups. 
The two most recent WEC chairs, Ann Jacobs, a Democrat, and Don Millis, a Republican, opened the testimony with each saying they have individual quibbles about the rule but the final text is the result of two years of consensus building and that legislators shouldn’t reject the rule because it isn’t perfect.
Millis said that the current statute guiding election observers is vague and this rule is the best chance of clarifying regulations to protect the rights of voters and observers because passing new legislation into law is challenging under the state’s divided government, with Republicans in control of the Legislature and a Democratic governor. 
“In the end, we can debate about whether the rule provides enough latitude or protection for observers, I agree,” Millis said. “I don’t agree with everything in the rule, but I don’t want the perfect to be the enemy of the good. Without this rule, municipal clerks have wide ranging authorities to manage polling places as they see fit. There’s no reasonable argument that observers are better off without this rule. Now certainly the Legislature could come up with an improved observer statute through legislation, but of course, that has to be signed into law. And there’s the rub.” 
Earlier this year, Republicans in the Assembly voted against an emergency rule that was broadly identical to the permanent rule being considered on Monday. In the hearing, Rep. Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee) complained that legislators were not involved earlier in the rulemaking process. 
“I feel a little bit like you didn’t even try here,” Neylon said. “You didn’t even try to do legislation. You’re choosing a rule and then telling us, ‘We can’t even work with you guys. This is what we got to do.’ And I find that a little bit insulting.” 
Despite the inclusion of election skeptics on the advisory committee process, much of the testimony in the more than three-hour hearing came from election conspiracy theorists who oppose the rule’s adoption. One opponent of the bill said there needed to be observers at Wisconsin’s central count location for tabulating election results because the internet routers that transmit the results are manufactured by the “Chinese Communist party.” 
Wisconsin’s election results are tabulated at the local and county levels, not by the state, and while unofficial results get sent over the internet, official results are determined using the physical tapes obtained from the voting machines. 
Former state Rep. Janel Brandtjen, who was one of the Legislature’s most prominent election deniers, complained that when she has tried to observe voting in the past, she’s been denied access because limited seats are taken up by people “playing Candy Crush all day.” 
Brandtjen also talked about Janet Angus, a Green Bay woman who was charged with disorderly conduct after berating a woman who was attempting to return her husband’s absentee ballot during the April 2022 election. Angus, the Wisconsin Examiner reported, was involved in a Republican effort to influence the Green Bay mayoral election through a lawsuit against the city’s use of audio recording equipment in its security system. 
Brandtjen also objected to the rule’s provisions that treat members of the news media differently than observers — mostly by allowing them to take videos and photos inside polling places. Brandtjen said she found that “distasteful.” Jacobs explained that allowing the public to learn about the voting process through the media is important and allowing reporters to do their jobs is necessary. 
“We balanced the First Amendment right of the press with the limitations we’re putting on observers, and we felt that was a reasonable accommodation,” Jacobs said. 
Elections commissioner Robert Spindell, a Republican, voted against the rule’s passage when the commission considered it and testified against its passage on Monday. Spindell said he was against the rule because it doesn’t allow observers to record video or audio at polling places, which he said would allow clerks to remove observers from polling sites without the observers being able to protect themselves. 
Rep. Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) said that as members of the committee were talking about large portions of the public being skeptical of election results, it was “beyond the pale” that Spindell would be testifying to the committee because of his involvement in the fake electors scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election. 
“Honestly, when members of this committee are talking about people still being concerned about election integrity, and we have somebody testifying who was a part of trying to overturn the 2020, election, I mean, if ever there was an unreliable witness on anything, I feel that that person is sitting in front of us today in this committee,” Snodgrass said.

David Bullard, R-Durant, sits at his desk on the Senate floor during the chamber's organizational day on Jan. 7, 2025. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A Senate panel on Monday advanced a measure to prevent the use of popular abortion-inducing drugs, including mifepristone.
House Bill 1168 makes it a felony to intentionally deliver abortion-inducing drugs in the state.
“We are stopping the pill from the abortion side of this just because of the damage it does to an unborn person, primarily, but also because of the damage it does to women and mothers,” said Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, the Senate author of the measure.
Abortion in Oklahoma is already illegal, except to save the life of the mother.
Abortion-inducing drugs, like RU486, better known as mifepristone, are not the same as the morning after pill. Abortion-inducing drugs end a pregnancy while the morning-after pill prevents pregnancy.
“RU486 has one intent and that intent is to murder an unborn child,” Bullard said.
Bullard said the measure would also prevent it from being shipped into Oklahoma through major carriers.
The measure would make it a felony with a fine not to exceed $100,000 or up to 10 years in prison or both.
“I simply cannot believe that we are continuing to try and create new felonies for substances that are legal, that do provide valid medical relief to individuals here in our state,” said Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City.
Hicks said she was appalled that the state continues to push the envelope when mothers are going into sepsis and experiencing fatal conditions before they can get medical intervention.
“This is the only medical procedure in the world that the success of the procedure depends on the death of the patient,” Bullard said.
The measure passed the Senate Health and Human Services Committee by a vote of 7-3. It is available for consideration in the Senate.

Speaking after several meetings in the state Capitol and on his way to talk with students at Michigan State University, Duggan took a moment to share with media some of his thoughts on his separation from the Democratic Party and his outlook of a state government that can cross the heightening political divide.
After Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer incurred the wrath of many within the Democratic Party for meeting with Republican President Donald Trump earlier this month, where Trump publicly offered her praise, Duggan said the situation is a prime example of how toxic and ineffective politics has become.
“My intention running independent is I’m going to work with everybody, and I’m going to work with people of good will on all sides, so the governor’s at a disadvantage because she ran as a Democrat, and Republicans had to line up against her and criticize her. It’s in a strange situation now that you got Democrats criticizing her too,” Duggan said.
Formerly calling her the ‘woman in Michigan’, Trump praises Whitmer during Oval Office visit

Whitmer as a leader went to Washington D.C. to advocate for Michigan, Duggan said, to push for a fighter aircraft mission that would help keep Macomb County’s Selfridge Air National Guard Base in operation and advocate to bring more manufacturing jobs to Flint.
“Democrats are tearing her down for trying to help Michigan,” Duggan said. “We need more people to push back on that and it’s one of the things I’m going to do.”
Duggan was expected to run for governor, but it came as a surprise in December when the three-term official broke from the Democratic Party to campaign as an independent candidate for the 2026 race.
A disgust with “toxic” politics was one of the driving forces behind his decision to run for the governor’s seat, Duggan has said since announcing his campaign to replace Whitmer, who will reach her term limit in 2026.
The gubernatorial race is becoming crowded early on across the ballot with Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson and Traverse City native Evan Space putting their hats in the ring for the Republican bid and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in the running for the Democratic side.
Duggan, who has long been affiliated with the Democratic Party, joining former Vice President Kamala Harris on several of her presidential campaign visits to Michigan, is raising concerns within the Democratic party that he’ll be a spoiler candidate, leeching votes away from the eventual Democratic nominee.
“Democrats say that I’m splitting the party, but… the Democrats are doing just fine at attacking each other,” Duggan said. “What I hear up here and I’ve talked to a number of associations dealing with the Legislature, every one of them said they’ve never seen the partisan hostility as bad as it is today. You can’t get simple bills done because the Republicans and Democrats are constantly fighting and I think there’s a lot of enthusiasm for my candidacy. For everybody who deals with the legislature.”
Michigan’s GOP House Speaker and Mayor of Detroit push for expanded public safety funding

 
At the end of the two-year legislative session where Democrats held a first in decades bicameral majority in the Legislature, lawmakers reached a stalemate where House Republicans boycotted session over tipped wage and sick time leave bills not being put up for a vote, only for those policies to be addressed at the start of this year during a new session. In the meantime, many legislative efforts died in the crossfire and chaos of the lame duck session, including bills that would have made a Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund to finance community law enforcement efforts statewide, a reality.
Detroit and other cities in Michigan, including Lansing saw spikes in violent crime during the COVID-19 pandemic that law enforcement and community violence intervention programs are still working to combat. Duggan has been a vocal supporter of the fund, which he believes will see movement in the state House this week.
Values like public safety and improving Michigan’s childhood literacy rates should be bipartisan efforts, with everyone in Lansing eager to lend a hand, Duggan said. And should he be elected, Duggan said that on his first say he’s sitting leaders down from around the state to address school funding and attracting tech companies and other economic partners to grow Michigan into a place where young people want to stay, noting Michigan’s stagnant population growth.
“I’m going to every corner of the state and talking to people who feel like they’ve been left behind and whether it’s rural areas up north or areas in southeastern Michigan that aren’t doing as well and I’m doing as much listening as talking right now,” Duggan said.
Ultimately, Duggan said Michigan needs to focus on the future and what could be rather than stay stuck in what has been under the ever-changing partisan control of swing-state Michigan.

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is asking state lawmakers for a $15 million increase in his General Revenue Fund budget for the upcoming year, saying his office needs a more “stable” system of funding as it takes on greater responsibilities, including the growing volume of litigation against the Trump administration.

In appearances before House and Senate budget committees in recent days, Raoul said the funding method that has traditionally been used for his office — one that relied heavily on fees and settlements generated by cases the office was involved in — no longer is sufficient to sustain its operations.

“This funding structure has evolved over the years as progressive court reforms have made fines and fees a less stable source of funding,” he told the House appropriations committee that oversees his office’s budget. “Also, proceeds from settlements or lawsuit damages are unreliable from year to year.”

In Fiscal Year 2019, the year Raoul took office, the attorney general’s budget totaled $87.7 million, according to state budget records. That included $32.2 million in general revenue funds and $54.5 million in “other state funds,” such as fees and settlements. Another $1 million came from federal funds.

Since then, the attorney general’s office has more than doubled. For the current fiscal year, the total budget stands at more than $193.7 million, including $105.5 million in general revenue funds and $74.9 million in “other state funds.” Federal funds are projected at $13.5 million.

Raoul’s proposed increase would bring next year’s general revenue fund budget to more than $120 million.

Since 2019, Raoul said, his office’s responsibilities have grown substantially. He said the General Assembly has passed 101 new laws — including some at Raoul’s own request — that either have added new duties or expanded existing duties of the office while his office has also been busy defending other laws passed by the General Assembly against legal challenges.

“The Attorney General's Office is the sole enforcement agency for violations of the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act and parts of the SAFE-T Act,” he told the House panel. “Our office is working diligently to defend both new and long-standing laws against constitutional challenges. Each of these cases require significant resources, including costs associated with our attorneys, travel to courts across the state, lengthy discovery processes, as well as expert with witness retention.”

In addition to those challenges, however, Raoul has taken on additional legal work in recent months challenging actions of President Donald Trump’s administration.

Since Trump was sworn into office for a second term on Jan. 20, Raoul has joined in filing 11 federal lawsuits challenging administration actions and has filed another 14 amicus briefs in support of other legal challenges. It is also defending the state against two lawsuits that the Trump administration has filed against Illinois.

“This budget will support supplying the requisite attorneys to step up where the federal government is stepping away, as well as attorneys involved in critical cases to protect our state's interests,” Raoul said.

Raoul’s office would not provide specific information about the number of attorneys or other staff it would hire with the additional money. A spokesperson in his office told Capitol News Illinois in an email that the money would allow the office “to hire additional attorneys to perform our growing statutorily-required responsibilities in addition to the critical work of vigorously defending the rights of Illinois residents from unconstitutional attacks by the Trump administration.”

Raoul also did not provide specific answers to questions from Republican lawmakers about how much his office has spent, or how many hours his attorneys have worked, pursuing litigation against the Trump administration.

“Our attorneys are, you know, they're not billing hours. They're on salary,” he said. “And so whether they work 20 hours in a day or eight hours in a day, they are compensated.”

Legislative committees are still in the process of holding hearings on each state agency’s budget request for the upcoming year. A final budget is expected to be voted on by the end of May.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-21 21:23:51+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: Chris Murphy is doing things differently than his congressional colleagues. How?,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/21/podcast-chris-murphy/,CT Mirror's Mark Pazniokas discusses his story about Sen. Chris Murphy becoming one of congressional Democrats' most outspoken anti-Trump voices.,"U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) has become one of congressional Democrats’ most outspoken anti-Trump voices. What is he doing differently from his colleagues?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Mark Pazniokas to discuss his article, “Chris Murphy, a new ‘pugilistic populist,’ maps resistance to Trump,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Mark’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Mark.
MP: Hello.
WSHU: You say U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) is at the forefront of Democratic resistance to the Trump administration. Is that what prompted you to spend some time with him?
MP: Yes. I mean, this is something that has been evolving since the week after the election. He had that kind of heart-to-heart chat via video on Twitter (X) with people, issuing a bit of a mea culpa on behalf of the Democratic Party for losing touch with its working-class base, praising Bernie Sanders, saying that he had been wrongfully described as having fringe positions. And ever since then, he has really been trying to assert a role as somebody leading the resistance to President Trump, but also offering Democrats some suggestions on how to proceed. Unlike Senator Sanders, he does not really have a fiery mass rally type of approach to this. You know, I likened him to somebody who is more appropriate for a TED talk. His style is almost like he’s coaching the party.
So anyway, we decided it was time to spend a little time with the senator who’s been raising a boatload of money and promising to go out on the road to bring this message to Republican districts. And anyway, that was just it was his time to spend a little bit of time with the Senator in Washington. So I spent a couple of days with him in DC, and a little bit more in Connecticut.
WSHU: One fascinating aspect about him is his social media savvy. What were you able to observe?
MP: Yes, he is very much of the generation who’s comfortable on social media, both short form and long form messaging. What I mean by that is he also has a Substack account, and he will write longish pieces going a little bit deeper about what he’s talking about. He is not averse to being repetitive. He repurposes his messaging, and he adds to it, which is considered to be the bedrock of modern political communication. One should not be shy about repeating oneself. That is the advice that politicians get these days, and he does so in different venues. He’s on Instagram. He is on really every social media platform. When I was in Washington, he delivered a floor speech outlining what he saw as the President’s approach to establishing an autocracy, and he gave a different version of that on Instagram just Thursday, which has gotten a fair amount of attention. Again, it’s a different demographic. It’s a younger audience. And he is not trying to shake the rafters of an old school speech, but he is really coming across as somebody giving a heart-to-heart in a more intimate setting. And that’s what these videos are. So he is very much a politician of the moment, as far as how you communicate with the base and try to expand the base.
WSHU: Talking about not being formal, I mean, he’d play a basketball game, and right after that, he’d get online and do something. And it’s woven into everyday living for him.
MP: It is, and he handles his own social media accounts, and he does most of his own writing for speeches, which is what he has told me. And and so he’s very comfortable as a communicator, but again, a communicator that is trying to make a substantive point in a way that the temperature is a little bit cooler than what we get from Bernie Sanders or AOC, who are having a very successful series of rallies that have attracted upwards of 30,000 people at times, which is bigger than Kamala Harris did during her campaign. So it’s a very impressive turnout, representing something as far as the cord they are striking with people who are upset with President Trump. At this point, Senator Murphy is raising money much the same way Bernie Sanders does. It’s small-dollar contributions casting a national net, and in the first quarter of this year, he raised $8 million that way, which, as far as among the senators who are not facing an immediate re-election challenge, made him second only to Bernie Sanders in raising money.
WSHU: Bernie Sanders has run for president a couple of times now. Does Murphy have that as an ambition?
MP: That’s always a question with Senator Murphy. When you are raising money and it’s off cycle, and whether you have the profile that he does on social media, inevitably, those questions come up. He continues to duck those questions. He insisted to me that he is motivated by rallying the troops, as it were, against what he sees as a threat to democracy. He said he does not have any plans for higher office, but you know that’s always in the back of your mind when you’re looking at somebody like Murphy. The party, obviously, is struggling over who will be the new generation of leadership.
Bernie Sanders is very popular, but he is 83 years old. He is not talking about running again when his term expires, which is the same time as Senator Murphy; his term would be up in 2030. So you know Cory Booker, who had that record-setting filibuster, Booker is a friend of Murphy’s. He’s a contemporary. They are in that same group of folks that people are looking at. Booker ran for president once before. Murphy is one of those people who is always on the list of people who are mentioned, you know, the Washington Post over the years mentioned him as a likely candidate for president in different cycles, even putting him up with people who had already created campaign committees and were actively running. Murphy has never done that. You know, he has to decide what he wants to be over the long term.
WSHU: But it is interesting that he’s going on this, he’s going out to red states to do some events with the youngest member of the House, which is Maxwell Frost, I believe.
MP: Correct.
WSHU: Who’s 28 years old? You have Bernie Sanders going with a 35-year-old AOC, so what’s going on there?
MP: Well, yes, that’s a great question. He said, you know, Congressman Frost shares his sense of urgency, but clearly there are some programming considerations, you know, a little bit of diversity, as far as age appeal, racial diversity.
WSHU: Frost was supported by Bernie Sanders.
MP: He was, and in fact, he has appeared on stage with Bernie Sanders.
WSHU: He introduced him at Coachella. I believe.
MP: Yes, he did. But you know, when it comes to Murphy’s ambitions, you have to remember that this is somebody who was elected to the State House of Representatives at the age of 25, he was elected to the State Senate age of 29, to the U.S. House of Representatives at 33, and to the Senate at 39. So now he’s 51, and the Senate is a place where, as an individual legislator, you can have great influence. But the question is, is that enough for Chris Murphy?
When people speculate about presidential ambitions, you know, they overlook whether or not maybe he’s more interested in being the Senate Democratic leader at some point. He very publicly broke with Chuck Schumer over the question of Schumer’s voting with Republicans to keep the government open. Murphy is preaching that the Democratic members of Congress need to be more risk-tolerant and to really take some dramatic steps, and letting the government shut down on the Republicans’ watch would be one of those steps. It would be risky, Murphy acknowledges, but yeah, that is another potential career path for him. But again, he is very close to the vest on whether he has that ambition; he really waved off any questions about his future when I was chatting with him in his office the other day.
WSHU: In the meantime, he’s emerged as a leader in the resistance against President Trump.
MP: And it’s a position he’s been very comfortable in taking, since really the week after the election, and building on it ever since. So again, when it comes to his personal ambition, it’s natural to look at this activity and say, where does he want to go with this? For the time being, he says, really his only goal is to get the party back on track, where it’s speaking to working-class people and also resisting what he is describing as President Trump’s efforts to establish a de facto autocracy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MURPHY-PROFILE-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 18:11:50.963633

Arraj United States Courthouse in Denver on Monday. Macdonald represents plaintiffs who are suing the Trump administration over their potential deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)A federal judge in Denver will soon decide whether to issue a temporary restraining order that would bar the Trump administration from removing from Colorado people who could be deported under the Alien Enemies Act.
At least 11 people have already been deported from Colorado to a brutal prison in El Salvador, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case said Monday.
The case was brought as a habeas corpus petition by two Venezuelan nationals held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora. They sued President Donald Trump and other federal officials earlier this month, challenging the government’s authority to remove them from Colorado.
Represented by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, the plaintiffs also ask U.S. District Judge Charlotte Sweeney to declare Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act unlawful, and they ask the court to certify the lawsuit as a class action, so that it would cover many other immigrants who are in custody in Colorado and could be removed from the country to the CECOT prison in El Salvador, where the Trump administration has already sent scores of detainees.
Sweeney heard arguments in the case Monday morning and said she would issue a ruling within 24 hours.

Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, represented the plaintiffs during the hearing. He pointed to recent government behavior in Texas and elsewhere, as well as an emergency ruling early Saturday by the U.S. Supreme Court, as indications that swift protections against removal for his clients were necessary.
He said that despite a Supreme Court ruling earlier this month that immigrants subject to Alien Enemies Act removal must be given “reasonable notice” to challenge their deportation in court, the Trump administration has engaged in a game of “whack-a-mole” by moving immigrants out of districts where deportations were temporarily barred to a facility in north Texas, where deportations were not barred. Macdonald said the Trump administration has interpreted “reasonable notice” in a way that gives no realistic opportunity for detainees to challenge their removal.
The Supreme Court in a rare early morning ruling Saturday halted deportations in the north Texas district, after it appeared authorities at the detention facility there were preparing detainees for removal.
Detainees in Colorado face a similar risk without the protection of a temporary restraining order, Macdonald argued.
“This has life or death consequences,” he said.
Lawyers for the Trump administration argued that Sweeney lacks jurisdiction to hear the case, because federal authorities have determined so far that the plaintiffs are not subject to deportation under the Aliens Enemies Act. The plaintiffs argue, however, that their status could change, and federal authorities in other cases have acted within hours to deport immigrants under the act and have failed to provide detainees due process.
Macdonald told reporters after the hearing that at least 11 people who were detained in Aurora have already been removed to the prison in El Salvador. The prison, which is alleged to keep detainees in inhumane conditions, is where U.S. authorities mistakenly sent Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.
Macdonald estimates that more than 100 people detained in Aurora would qualify as members of the class that’s proposed in the lawsuit.
Trump proclaimed on March 15 that all Venezuelans who are not permanent U.S. residents, are 14 years or older, and are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, or TdA, can be removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that has been invoked on only three previous occasions and only during war. The Trump administration says 137 people have been deported under the Alien Enemies Act.
Plaintiffs in the Colorado case are identified by their initials, D.B.U. and R.M.M. They both deny being members of TdA.
D.B.U. is a 32-year-old asylum seeker who has lived in Colorado with his wife and two children. R.M.M. is also a Colorado resident who is seeking asylum. He says that he fled Venezuela to escape TdA, which killed his wife’s father and uncle and which he fears will kill him and his wife and children. 
Last week, Sweeney issued an initial order that halted Alien Enemies Act deportations in Colorado.

SPRINGFIELD — When Illinois named small farmer Nathan Ryder a finalist for a federal $100,000 Local Food Infrastructure Grant, he made big plans for his farm in the southeastern tip of the state. Then the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut his funding.

The Ryder family farm, a 10-acre operation in Pope County that produces chicken eggs, sheep and some fruits and vegetables, would have used the money to purchase a refrigerated truck.  Ryder said he wanted to use the truck to sell his own products farther away. He was also going to transport other farmers’ food back to Southern Illinois, expanding that rural region’s access to healthy, affordable food.

“Why is it that [people’s access to fresh fruits and vegetables] is somehow considered optional?” Ryder asked in an interview. “We should be able to feed the people around us.”

Illinois was approved for $43 million in federal reimbursement funds for two food programs designed to strengthen statewide food systems, but when the Trump administration took office it informed the stated, without explanation, that the remaining $17.8 million in federal agriculture reimbursements still owed to Illinois would cease after Jan. 19, 2025.

Farmers like Ryder have asked the state to consider new models for subsidizing, planning and regulating agriculture to help them keep Illinoisans fed. Illinois lawmakers are trying to help by pushing two bills through the legislature.


The first, HB 3701, would reallocate state funds to purchase farm food locally.
The second, HB 2196, would help poultry farmers sell more of their products directly to consumers.


Both the Illinois General Assembly and Gov. JB Pritzker have shown some reluctance to spend state money on this issue, citing budgetary concerns. But the two bills that soared through the House Agriculture Committee recently both demonstrated dedication to supporting local farmers amid turbulent changes in the federal government.

The first bill, the Good Food Purchasing Law (GFPL), proposed by Rep. Sonya Harper, D-Chicago, would reestablish the Good Food Purchasing Policy Task Force with a new mandate to find between one and three Illinois-run institutions (public colleges, for example) that would begin purchasing from small local farmers like Ryder. Currently such institutions are fiscally obligated to purchase food from the lowest bidder, often larger companies in places outside Illinois that have more agriculture capacity.

“I represent communities on the South Side of Chicago, where healthy access to food has never been guaranteed,” Harper said at a press conference in Springfield earlier this month. “And so this bill addresses issues that I’ve seen firsthand in my district.”

Currently 3 million Illinoisans, roughly 1-in-4, live in food deserts, defined by the USDA as areas with little access to healthy food.

If the bill passes, Illinois would be the first state in the country to promote purchasing locally sourced ethical food within its own state departments. Such programs already exist in 72 institutions across 26 cities, funded through a combination of local and federal dollars, including in Cook County since 2017.

The Good Food Purchasing Law that made it past the House Agriculture Committee is a watered-down version of a more-significant bill that would have required some state agencies to immediately start purchasing local, ethically sourced food. That version was opposed by a number of state departments, including the Department of Agriculture and Department of Corrections.

The House Agriculture Committee voted in favor of the stronger GFPL bill 6-3 on March 18th, along partisan lines, with Republican lawmakers opposing it. The amended version passed unanimously in committee last week on April 8.

However, last week the bill was sent back to the Rules Committee, because it was growing late in this legislative session to push it through. In the bill’s place, Harper put forward HJR 0027, a nonbinding resolution that calls for Illinois departments to implement this measure as soon as practicable. The resolution calls for recreating the Good Food Purchasing Policy Task Force and urges, but does not require, state agencies to investigate their potential for a good food purchasing pilot program.

The other bill deals with poultry. In addition to expanding local farmers’ industry by reallocating state funds to purchase local farm food, legislators hope to loosen rules on self-processed poultry in order to help local farmers sell more of their products directly to consumers. The House Agriculture Committee on April 8 also unanimously passed this second bill, an amendment to the Meat and Poultry Inspection Act (HB 2196), sponsored by Rep. Charles Meier, R-Okawville.

Should the bill become law, self-processed chicken would be available at local farmers markets, both decreasing Illinoisans’ reliance on large chicken growers and opening more of an industry for local farmers.

This bill also raises the annual cap for on-farm poultry processing from 5,000 head to 7,500 head. Most of Illinois’ neighboring states have higher limits, and 40 states have caps of 20,000.

Illinois currently has only four poultry processing facilities, according to farmer Ed Dubrick of DuChick Ranch in Cissna Park in Iroquois County. As locally grown meat grows more popular, Dubrick has to book very far in advance to get processing time slots, which means he’s often not selling his product at its best. Further, the hours-long drives to processing plants can be hard on the animals, says Dubrick.

Larger companies that can afford their own processing facilities don’t face the same burden.

For niche poultry products like quail, Illinois has no poultry processors at all, Dubrick said. Some farmers must drive to the East Coast to process their product, a risky trip for the quails and a financial burden for small farmers, who often benefit from selling niche products.

Harper raised a concern during the Agriculture Committee meeting that it might be best to hold off on loosening poultry regulations until after the current bird flu outbreak subsides. But witnesses testified that they believe this bill wouldn’t increase the risk of flu spreading, and Harper has since been supportive.

The poultry bill passed through the House earlier this month without opposition.

Both HB 3701 and HJR 0027 are still under review by the Pritzker administration, which has yet to take a position on either, according to a statement from the governor’s press secretary, Alex Gough.

HB 3701 still needs to make it through the Senate, where it’s currently waiting to be assigned to a committee for review.

Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, spoke during a subcommittee meeting March 20, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)State Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, announced Monday he is exploring a 2026 gubernatorial bid.
His announcement, posted on the social media platform X, comes less than two weeks after Gov. Kim Reynolds said she would not seek another term as governor in the upcoming election.
Reynolds has held office since 2017, taking the position after former Gov. Terry Branstad vacated the governor’s office to serve as U.S. ambassador to China during President Donald Trump’s first term. As Branstad had held the office since 2010, Republicans have not had an open primary field heading into a gubernatorial election for over a decade. The 2026 election will be the first time for several Republicans interested in the position to compete without an incumbent in the race.
Bousselot is one of the Republicans interested in competing for the governorship. He said he launched an exploratory campaign for the Iowa governor’s race Monday, thanking Reynolds for her leadership in a statement and saying he has received encouragement from others to run.

“The next governor has big shoes to fill,” he said. “I am honored by the calls asking me to consider running for governor. I am exploring this run because our next governor of Iowa should be a leader who listens to the people, acts on principle and works tirelessly to deliver results.”
Bousselot has served as state senator for Iowa’s Senate District 21 since 2023. He first took elected office in 2021, winning a special election to represent House District 37 from 2021 through 2023. Before his election, Bousselot served as the director of the Department of Management under Reynolds and as Branstad’s chief of staff in the governor’s office.
Branstad was one of the people who have encouraged Bousselot to run for governor, according to the news release. The former governor said in a statement he was “pleased Mike Bousselot is considering running for governor.”
“I have known Mike since 2009,” Branstad said. “… Mike worked hand-in-hand with President Trump’s team during the president’s first term, and he will be a fighter for President Trump again. Mike has the work ethic, vision and character necessary to lead Iowa to an even brighter future.”
Alongside Bousselot, several other Republicans have expressed interest in the position. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird indicated in a statement she is considering a run, and House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters last week he is “not ruling anything out” when considering a 2026 gubernatorial bid. The Des Moines Register reported State Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, is also considering running for the position. One Republican, former GOP state Rep. Brad Sherman, announced his gubernatorial campaign prior to Reynolds announcing she would not run for reelection.
Iowa Auditor Rob Sand, the sole Democrat to hold statewide elected office, has not officially announced plans to run for governor in 2026, but is widely expected to join the race after having raised significant funds leading into the upcoming election season.

(Courtesy of the New Jersey Governor's Office)State education officials are working to launch a new computerized student proficiency exam that could be implemented as early as next year, Education Commissioner Kevin Dehmer told the Assembly Budget Committee Monday.
Dehmer told the budget panel he expects the department to begin implementing the new assessment in the spring of 2026, adding that its electronic nature will allow for speedier data analysis that could help educators address underperformance on specific topics and subjects.
“One of the big things is we’re able to gain more information with less seat time, and because of the accessibility of data, we can translate that back so that teachers can focus on core areas for students so they understand where students might be struggling,” he said.
The electronic test, referred to only as “next-gen” or the “next generation assessment” Monday, could also be tailored to student performance, allowing more advanced students to tackle tougher questions.
Less advanced students could see simpler questions, Dehmer said, to better identify areas in need of improvement.
“Maybe it’s with a certain teacher. It comes out they didn’t emphasize something enough, they can go back and change how they’re doing things to make sure students are picking that subject matter up a little bit better,” the commissioner said.
The changes would come as schools are fighting to overcome learning losses incurred during the pandemic.
Results from the New Jersey Student Learning Assessment released in December showed some improvement in math and English test scores, but proficiency continued to lag behind prepandemic levels in both subjects.
That year, 52% of tested students met or exceeded expectations on the English language arts exam, compared to 58% in 2019, while 40% met or exceeded expectations on the math assessment, compared to 45% five years earlier.
 School funding

Some committee member raised concerns about proposed changes to the state’s school funding formula that would allow and incentivize districts raising too little locally to seek higher property tax increases to meet their fair share — the portion of funding a school district is responsible for raising through property taxes.
“Our fear … is that we allow that to happen just for one year, which was last year, and then this kind of opens the gate to something else that we really don’t have control of, of how much a district may be able to raise. It puts us in a precarious position,” said Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), the panel’s chair.
As lawmakers move to finalize a new state budget by June 30, Gov. Phil Murphy has proposed a $20 million pool of funding to encourage districts taxing beneath their local fair share to seek tax increases above the state’s 2% cap on property tax growth. Murphy also wants to limit decreases in state aid to 3% and increases to 6%.
Under budget language proposed by the administration, districts that raise taxes above the 2% cap would receive $1 million or 5% of the tax increase that fell above the cap, whichever is less.
In recent weeks, some school districts have proposed staggering property tax increases, but Dehmer, speaking generally, said such plans could overstate the level of tax increases a district would eventually seek.
“What they chose to do was say, ‘We’re going to pass a resolution for the maximum amount, and we’re going to work through this from there,’” Dehmer said. “I think there was some reporting on those resolutions saying, ‘We’re going to go up this high,’ and that may not be the final version that comes to pass.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/42712297215_30935ab2e2_c.jpg,,,2025-04-21 18:11:50.963633

More than 5 million borrowers sit in default on their federal student loans, and just 38% of borrowers are current on their payments, the department said.“American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement Monday.During last year’s presidential campaign, President Donald Trump criticized his predecessor and successor, President Joe Biden, for his efforts to erase student debt. McMahon resumed that line of attack Monday, blaming Biden’s administration for unreasonably raising borrowers’ expectations of forgiveness.“The Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear. Hundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers,” McMahon said.She added that “going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment — both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation’s economic outlook.”The department said the Office of Federal Student Aid will restart the Treasury Offset Program, which the U.S. Treasury Department administers, on May 5.The Education Department statement said all borrowers who are in default will get emails over the next two weeks “making them aware of these developments and urging them to contact the Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan, or sign up for loan rehabilitation.”The department said the Office of Federal Student Aid will “send required notices beginning administrative wage garnishment” later this summer.More than 42.7 million borrowers owe more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the department. The administration claims that “instead of protecting responsible taxpayers, the Biden-Harris Administration put them on the hook for irresponsible lending, pushing the federal student loan portfolio toward a fiscal cliff.”",,,,2025-04-21 18:11:50.963633

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma lawmakers sent a bill that would limit the governor’s power to close businesses in a pandemic to Gov. Kevin Stitt’s desk Monday after over an hour of discussion on the House floor. 
Senate Bill 672, authored by Sen. Julie McIntosh, R-Porter, and Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, would require “scientific evidence” that a business contributes to spreading disease during a declared pandemic before a governor can order businesses closed. The governor would also need to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing to “nonessential” businesses.
Critics of the bill, all Democrats, said the legislation would prioritize protecting businesses over human life and fails to create clear processes for hearings or define what is considered “scientific evidence.” Supporters said the measure, which passed 74-15 along party lines, was “preventative maintenance” that protected due process for businesses. 
“This is not an indictment of what’s happened in the past, but it’s all about what we’re gonna do moving forward … that we’re going to use due process,” West said. 
Rep. John Waldron, D-Tulsa, said during the COVID-19 pandemic best practices to mitigate the spread were not known and this measure could prevent “erring on the side of caution.” 
But Rep. Chris Sneed, R-Fort Gibson, said this measure will protect small businesses from “government overreach.” 
Stitt said Wednesday he supported the measure “on the surface,” but would fully review its contents when it came to his desk.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The federal government is blaming a U.S. citizen for his arrest during a traffic stop in Leon County last week under a temporarily blocked state immigration law.
A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security said Monday that Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, was detained Wednesday after he told a Florida Highway Patrol trooper that he was in the country illegally.
“Immediately after learning the individual was a United States citizen, he was released,” a DHS senior official said in a statement Monday. “When individuals admit to committing a crime, like entering the country illegally, they will of course be detained while officers investigate.”
The trooper charged Lopez-Gomez following a traffic stop with illegally entering the state as an “unauthorized alien,” under a new state law that a federal judge temporarily suspended on April 4. Lopez-Gomez, released from Leon County jail Thursday evening, insists he told the trooper he was a U.S. citizen born in Georgia, handed over his Social Security card and Georgia ID, which meets federal security standards under the REAL ID Act of 2005.
The case garnered national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reporting on Thursday.
Differing accounts
The arrest report states that Lopez-Gomez said he was in the country illegally and had entered Florida illegally, but turned over his ID. However, the arrest report doesn’t mention the Social Security card. The trooper stopped the car Wednesday morning because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the report. Lopez-Gomez was a passenger in the car with two others on his way to a flooring job from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee.
Amilcar Sales-Lopez, a family member of the driver and boss of the crew, said he arrived at the scene on U.S. Highway 319 because the men called him as they were getting pulled over. Sales-Lopez told the two troopers that Lopez-Gomez was a U.S. citizen, but first had to hand over his Florida driver’s license, he said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.
“He said I had to verify who I was or that they would arrest me,” Sales-Lopez said in Spanish.
“They wanted to intimidate me,” he added.
The arrest report doesn’t mention that Sales-Lopez was present during the arrest.
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, his mother told the Phoenix. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia.
The Phoenix has requested video footage of the arrest from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. A spokesperson from the department repeated in a statement to the Phoenix Friday that Lopez-Gomez had stated he was in the country illegally and that he had a federal detainer issued on him.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a detainer asking the jail to hold Lopez-Gomez for 48 hours after his arrest. A Leon County judge cited the ICE hold as the reason she lacked jurisdiction to release Lopez-Gomez, even though she found no probable cause for the arrest after inspecting the Georgia birth certificate and Social Security card his mom brought to court.
The ICE hold states that DHS determined Lopez-Gomez could be deported based on biometric confirmation of his identity and his statements to an immigration officer or “reliable evidence.”
DHS did not respond when the Phoenix asked whether the arresting trooper had federal authorization to act as an immigration official. Approximately 1,400 troopers have completed 40 hours of training to question and arrest people they suspect are in the country without authorization.
Although Attorney General James Uthmeier argues the federal prohibition on enforcement of the law, SB 4C, doesn’t apply to law enforcement, he sent a memo Friday to FHP, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, police chiefs, and sheriffs stating that they shouldn’t arrest or detain anyone under the suspended law.
U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams extended her prohibition on the enforcement of Florida’s immigration law until April 29.

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)In advance of an expected executive order on Tuesday, New Mexico’s federal delegation, led by U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, sent a letter on April 21 to U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum requesting the federal government leave the state’s monuments intact.
“National monuments are vitally important to our history and any proposals to reduce their boundaries will not  be reflective of the voices of New Mexicans,” the delegation wrote. “Each monument in New Mexico represents years of community  advocacy and support for the protection of the value they hold. In New Mexico, we have a $3.2 billion outdoor  recreation sector and monuments are a significant contributor to this robust economy.”
The letter particularly singles out Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument, Rio Grande del Norte, and Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks, which the letter says “are under consideration for  reduction or elimination.”
Organ Mountains in the southern part of the state hosts “significant petroglyph and archeological sites,” the letter notes, while Rio Grande del Norte “boasts some of  New Mexico’s most prized recreational opportunities in an area where the Rio Grande carves an 800-foot gorge through historic volcanic activity” and “provides access for traditional use like piñon nut collection.” Regarding Tent Rocks, the delegation notes that TIME included it on its list of the World’s Greatest Places of 2025. “Not only is Tent Rocks ‘geologically surreal,’ the letter says, “but it is  also a sacred landscape to the Cochiti Pueblo.”
“There is no greater value to these natural landscapes than what is brought to the community through their continued protection,” the letter concludes. “Withdrawing protections from these sites would threaten the economic benefits associated with New Mexico’s outdoor recreation economy and it undermines our community and tribal voices.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tentrocks3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-21 17:06:42.551649

Bob Ferguson in his first bill signing event on Friday, April 4, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)During his inaugural address in January, Gov. Bob Ferguson highlighted his support for a bill that would grant the governor authority to limit other states’ National Guard troops from entering Washington, unless they are mobilized by the president. 
On Monday, Ferguson signed the policy into law.
“We cannot allow as a state to have armed forces come into our home and enforce policies that are against our core values,” Ferguson said. “State autonomy is the foundation of our federalist system. This bill is a simple but very important expression of that system.”
House Bill 1321 came after Republican governors put out a statement in December saying they were “ready to utilize every tool at our disposal,” including the National Guard, to enforce President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. 
Lead bill sponsor Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma, has said that without the bill, “there is nothing to prevent other states from sending their National Guards here to carry out their own agendas.”
Democrats say they consulted with the state’s Military Department, the Office of the Attorney General, and others to ensure the bill didn’t create unintended consequences, like undermining military readiness or disaster response. 
The law will take effect immediately. 
Republicans questioned the need for the legislation, with state Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, calling it “pointless” during floor debate.
The National Guard is a state-based military force when not activated for federal service and is under the command of the state governor and the president of the United States. Some states also have State Guards, which are under state control. 
Many states, including Republican strongholds like Texas, Idaho and North Dakota, already have laws on the books similar to the new Washington law. 
States have previously sent National Guard troops to other states to support immigration enforcement. In 2021, Texas launched an operation to increase security along the state’s section of the southern border with Mexico. Other Republican states, like Florida and Montana, have sent their own National Guard troops to support Texas.

DemasMembers of the University of Michigan Faculty Senate voted overwhelmingly in support of a resolution to establish a mutual defense compact with other universities in the Big Ten Academic Alliance according to results posted on Monday. 
The faculty Senate voted 92.8% in favor of the resolution, which was introduced at its meeting last Thursday, and was voted on by faculty members through the weekend. It calls on university President Santa J. Ono to propose and help establish a mutual academic defense compact among all members of the Big Ten as President Donald Trump cracks down on American Universities, pulling funding from research and threatening further cuts against institutions that do not comply with the administration’s orders. 
Throughout last year’s campaign trail, Trump threatened to cut federal funding “for any school pushing critical race theory and radical gender ideology.” As Trump works to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion efforts several universities, including U of M, have shuttered or restructured their DEI offices.
The Trump administration has also sought to silence Pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, while more than 1,500 international students — including students at several Michigan universities — have had their visas revoked by the administration.
“Whereas recent and escalating politically motivated actions by governmental bodies pose a significant threat to the foundational principles of American higher education, including the autonomy of university governance, the integrity of scientific research, and the protection of free speech;”
“Whereas the Trump administration and aligned political actors have signaled a willingness to target individual institutions with legal, financial, and political incursion designed to undermine their public mission, silence dissenting voices, and/or exert improper control over academic inquiry,” the resolution reads, calling for solidarity between the 18 universities which make up the Big Ten. 
Under the compact, the universities would contribute to a shared or distributed defense fund for “immediate and strategic support to any member institution under direct political or legal infringement.”
The compact also asks that the participating institutions share their legal counsel, governance experts and public affairs offices at the request of any member facing political infringement to coordinate a “a unified and vigorous response.” 
This response would include but not be limited to legal representation and countersuit actions; strategic public communication; amicus briefs and expert testimony; legislative advocacy and coalition-building and related topical research as needed. 
Michigan State University, Indiana University, Rutgers University and University of Nebraska-Lincoln have adopted similar resolutions with Ohio State University slated to vote on a resolution this week, while the University of Southern California will hold its vote on May 7. 
According to a report from the Daily Bruin, the University of California, Los Angeles academic senate will consider a resolution in defense of the University of California, alongside an endorsement of a “shared values of higher education” statement assembled by senate leaders within the Big Ten Academic Alliance. However, UCLA Academic Senate Chair Kathleen Bawn did not confirm whether the university would take up a mutual defense compact resolution. 
While not a member of the Big Ten, University of Massachusetts Amherst has passed its own mutual defense compact resolution aiming to partner with the nation’s nearly 250 public land grant universities alongside other Massachusetts higher learning institutions.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0011-2-scaled-e1745267718418-1024x623.jpg,,,2025-04-21 17:06:42.551649

(Photo courtesy of University of Northern Iowa)The University of Northern Iowa’s business school has made its first international partnership to bring students from Thailand to Cedar Falls to study, the university has announced.
According to a news release, UNI and Assumption University in Bangkok signed an agreement last week to form a 2+2 program for students to complete the first two years of courses at Assumption then finish a business degree at UNI.
The partnership has been in the works for almost two years, according to the release, and students participating in the 2+2 program are expected to start heading to UNI in 2026. Founded as the Assumption School of Business in 1969, Assumption University of Thailand is a private, nonprofit university overseen by global Catholic order the Brothers of St. Gabriel.

UNI Global Opportunities Coordinator Chris Schrage taught graduate marketing management courses at Assumption during the fall 2024 semester, the release stated, and nine countries were represented among the 40 students she taught.
“We really like what they have to offer: the rigor of their classrooms and the fact that they have such a wide range of students asking about international opportunities when they aren’t even from Thailand,” Schrage said in the release.
According to the release, the two institutions are also working on programs to offer students international study for shorter terms. A release from Assumption University stated this initial agreement could pave the way for more “shared learning experiences,” including further student and faculty exchanges and joint programming.
Wilson College of Business Associate Dean Mary Connerley said in the release the new partnership will help students from both schools broaden their horizons and global knowledge.
“Bringing international students to UNI helps our students be exposed to different ways of thinking, different cultures and different ways of living,” Connerley said in the release. “We have a lot of students who like to travel on study abroad programs. We want to continue to offer those programs, but not all of our students can do that. So I think it’s great when we can bring more students here from different cultures. It can lead to our students developing some really deep friendships.”

(Photo by Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)Arizona’s top state prosecutor is seeking more information about immigration officials’ arrest of a U.S. citizen from New Mexico earlier this month.
A federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona on April 9 filed a criminal complaint against 19-year-old Jose Hermosillo, of Albuquerque.
The complaint alleges that on April 8, immigration agents found Hermosillo “without proper immigration documents” near Nogales, Arizona.
Arizona Public Media reports that Hermosillo and his girlfriend were visiting from Albuquerque to see family in Tucson, Arizona. The radio station reports that Hermosillo said he has never been to Nogales and that he was held in the Florence Correctional Center for 10 days.
A few days after the U.S. Marshals took Hermosillo to Florence, his family presented documents showing his U.S. citizenship, according to a statement provided to Source on Monday in response to an emailed inquiry to its Office of Public Affairs email address. The statement is attributable to a “senior U.S. Department of Homeland Security official,” the unsigned email said. 
On Monday morning, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes posted on X that her office had reached out to ICE for more information about Hermosillo’s arrest, “for answers on how this was allowed to happen to an American citizen.”
“It is wholly unacceptable to wrongfully detain U.S. citizens,” she wrote.
A spokesperson for Mayes’ office told Source NM in an email that the request was made over the phone but declined to comment further.
The complaint, signed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent and a prosecutor, alleges that Hermosillo “admitted to illegally entering the United States from Mexico” on April 7. It also wrongfully states that he is a “citizen of Mexico.”
According to the DHS official, Hermosillo “said he wanted to turn himself in and completed a sworn statement identifying as a Mexican citizen who had entered unlawfully.”

“This arrest was the direct result of Hermosillo’s own actions and statements,” the DHS official said.
A federal judge dismissed the case on April 17, court records show. The DHS official said Hermosillo was then released to his family.
The judge’s dismissal order states that the government moved to dismiss the case. In an email on Monday, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona declined to answer Source NM’s questions about the case, and wrote, “The U.S. Attorney’s Office does not have anything to add beyond what is found in the public record.” 
The case against Hermosillo is absent from a news release the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona published three days after his arrest, in which the agency touted “immigration-related criminal charges” it had filed in the previous week.
Requests for comment from ICE and Hermosillo’s attorney were not returned on Monday.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Supreme Court reversed a district court by declaring separate husband-and-wife annuities created to settle legal claims after a man was catastrophically injured in an explosion must be considered marital property in a divorce proceeding.
Justices of the Supreme Court, echoing a three-judge panel of the Kansas Court of Appeals, said a Johnson County District Court judge erred by concluding annuities held by accident victim Aaron Meek and his spouse at time of the accident, Nancy Karanja-Meek, weren’t martial property.
Both appellate courts said all property, including confidential cash awards and deferred payments, had to be treated as marital property when a marriage ended.
“We affirm the Court of Appeals and remand to the district court for it to conduct equitable division of the marital estate with both annuities considered marital property,” Justice Caleb Stegall said in the opinion published Friday.
Meek was compensated due to a traumatic brain injury he suffered Feb. 19, 2013, when a Time Warner Cable contractor installing underground fiber optic cable in Kansas City, Missouri, struck a high-pressure natural gas line with a boring drill. Escaping gas migrated to JJ’s Restaurant, which exploded and leveled the building. One person was killed and 15 injured.
Karanja-Meek had brought a claim for loss of companionship after her husband’s accident because “I lost Aaron, the Aaron that was there before he got injured.”
Both resolved their personal-injury claims in 2015 and received lump-sum payments as well as separate annuities with payments until 2045.
In 2017, Karanja-Meek filed for divorce. A question that wasn’t settled through negotiation was division of the annuities. Karanja-Meek said the annuities were awarded individually and shouldn’t be divided by the court, but Meek contended the court should award him “all or the vast majority” of his wife’s annuity because she was “supposed to be my caretaker.”
District Court Judge Christopher Jayaram entered a divorce decree in 2022 and ruled the annuities were separate property. In response, Meek turned to the Court of Appeals because he wanted Karanja-Meek’s annuity — not his own — declared marital property.
The Court of Appeals concluded both annuities were marital property subject to division. Meek appealed to the Supreme Court and claimed the Court of Appeals relied on flawed legal analysis.
Justice Stegall said Karanja-Meek, who had clearly lost before the Court of Appeals, in a “rarely seen turn” suddenly realized the Court of Appeals was correct to view all property as marital.
Stegall, an appointee of Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, said the lower court’s consideration of “mechanical” and “analytical” approaches to property division in divorce cases was “disapproved.”
“We find it simpler to follow the plain text of the statutory scheme without the need for labels,” he said. “If a label is required, one might term it the ‘statutory approach’ — which has the added benefit of preserving the court’s role in Kansas to interpret the law, not write it.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1242546-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-21 16:11:22.060978
,DC,2025-04-21 20:08:51+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Advocates urge restart of suspended refugee resettlement program,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/advocates-urge-restart-suspended-refugee-resettlement-program,,"WASHINGTON — State and local leaders and advocates from across the country called on the Trump administration Monday to immediately restart the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, saying the program’s suspension has harmed communities.Trump signed an order suspending the program on his first day back in office and the administration withheld funds appropriated by Congress for those services. Federal courts have partially rejected that order, but the Trump administration has still not resumed the program, the advocates said.By indefinitely halting the program and subsequently defunding its infrastructure, Trump “stranded” more than 100,000 refugees “who had already been interviewed by Homeland Security and received written notices from the U.S. government that they were eligible for resettlement,” Mark Hetfield, president of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, or HIAS, said at a press conference hosted by several refugee advocacy groups Monday.‘More than a program’Aisha Koroma, a Refugee Congress delegate for Washington, D.C., said the Refugee Admissions Program “is more than a program.” Refugee Congress is a national organization advocating for people who are forcibly displaced. “It represents lives, dreams, resilience, hope — it is a gateway for future change-makers, doctors, engineers, artists, tradespeople — people who are ready and eager to become assets to America’s workforce and to contribute meaningfully to its economy and communities,” Koroma said. “Pausing this program doesn’t just delay paperwork, it delays possibilities, it ensures tragedies, it tears families apart, and it leaves people vulnerable, but most importantly, it sends a painful message that America is closing its doors, not only to those who need it most, but also those who fill jobs, those who open stores and people who sat on our school boards,” Koroma added.Rev. Noel Andersen, national field director at Church World Service and faith leader with the United Church of Christ, said the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program “has signified a space of refuge and hope for the world as a beacon of light for democracy.”“Now, because of the increased discriminatory attacks on all immigrants, including refugees, we’re in a dire place for this program, even as it is clearly represented in our laws written by Congress and with a recent court order to resume the refugee program, yet it has not happened, and now our own democracy is in danger,” he said.Legal challenge ongoingThe International Refugee Assistance Project filed a lawsuit on behalf of HIAS, Church World Service, Lutheran Community Services Northwest and refugees  impacted by the order in February.A federal judge in Washington state granted a nationwide injunction in February requested by the groups who challenged Trump’s executive order suspending the program and the withholding of funds for those services.The faith groups then asked the federal judge for an emergency hearing after the U.S. State Department terminated their contracts despite the earlier injunction. The court ordered in March that the administration offer a status report on their efforts to resume the processing of refugees.The administration quickly appealed the judge’s subsequent order requiring the State Department to restore contracts to nonprofits that help with resettling refugees. An appeals court denied part of the administration’s request to halt the lower court’s earlier preliminary injunction. The federal judge on April 11 granted the groups’ motion to enforce the first preliminary injunction issued. Hetfield said the administration defied the February injunction effectively ordering the administration to restart the program and the federal appeals court upholding the part of that order focused on admitting more than 100,000 conditionally approved refugees.“Yet two months later, the administration has continued to defy the court order, noting in its filings last week that it intends to admit only a fraction of a fraction of conditionally approved refugees, and, in fact, has taken no visible steps yet to even do that,” he said.Trump’s January executive order also instructed officials at the State and Homeland Security departments to submit a report to Trump 90 days from the order — April 20 — “regarding whether resumption of entry of refugees into the United States under the (U.S. Refugee Admissions Program) would be in the interests of the United States.”Trump also instructed the departments to submit further reports every 90 days thereafter until he determines whether resumption of the program “is in the interests of the United States.”Advocates said Monday they have yet to hear whether the administration’s first 90-day report regarding the potential resumption of the program was delivered to the White House.Asked for a comment on the issue, a White House spokesperson acknowledged receiving the inquiry but did not immediately provide a substantive response.",,,,2025-04-21 16:11:22.060978
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-21 20:07:16+00:00,CT Mirror,Four Connecticut students with visas in jeopardy sue federal government,Eddy Martinez | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/21/ct-student-visas-lawsuit/,"The students accused ICE officials of unlawfully terminating their student status, stripping them of the ability to study and maintain employment in the United States.","Four international students living in Connecticut are suing the federal government after learning their student visas are now in jeopardy.
In a complaint filed last week, the students accused officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of unlawfully terminating their student status, stripping them of their ability to pursue their studies and maintain employment in the United States.
The plaintiffs, who are among more than 100 international students who joined the suit, say they’re now at risk of arrest, detention and deportation.
“This is all part of the Trump administration’s plan to get rid of all immigrants in America, not just undocumented immigrants,” said lawyer Charles Kuck, who is representing them in court. “And nobody should be surprised by that.”
According to court documents, three of the Connecticut students are from India and live in New Haven. A fourth is a Chinese citizen living in Vernon and attending the University of Connecticut. They filed the suit anonymously in a federal court in Georgia, which is set to hear arguments next week on their request for a preliminary injunction.
[CT student’s visas revoked: As details emerge, fears escalate]
The students allege immigration officials unlawfully terminated their records in a government database that tracks compliance with the F-1 visa program, which allows nonimmigrants to stay in the United States while pursuing academic studies.
Terminating the records “effectively ends F-1 student status” and serves to revoke their student visas, the plaintiffs argue. Kuck said the students have received no explanation for the move, and no notice, as required by the program.
In a written statement, U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin pushed back on the lawsuit’s allegations. McLaughlin did not directly address the circumstances of the students in Connecticut, but suggested criminal activity and advocacy for “violence and terrorism” were a focus for enforcement.
“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live [and] study in the United States of America,” McLaughlin said. “When you break our laws and advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.”
According to the lawsuit, all four Connecticut residents previously faced criminal charges, which were ultimately disposed of or dismissed.
The University of Connecticut student, identified in court as John Doe, was involved in a 2017 domestic dispute where he was arrested and charged along with the other party, according to the complaint. The student was not convicted, and all charges were dismissed the following year, the complaint says. The student planned to graduate from UConn in August 2025. He learned April 9 that his status was terminated.
A student in New Haven said in court he was charged last year with a series of driving offenses, including driving without a license, but those charges were dismissed. The student planned to graduate in May, but received an email from a U.S. Embassy in India informing him his visa was revoked, according to the suit.
Two other New Haven residents completed their studies, but remain in the country on valid visas, which allow students to keep working in their field for a period of time after graduation.
One was arrested for evading the scene of a car crash. The case was disposed in October 2024, and the student graduated the same month, the complaint states. He learned via an April 9 email from his college that his student record was terminated, according to the suit.
The other was notified April 4 by a US embassy in India that his visa had been revoked, according to the suit. He was later informed his student record was terminated due to a criminal record check, according to the suit. The student was previously arrested on domestic violence related charges, which were dismissed April 8 after he completed a diversionary program, according to the suit.
Kuck said uncertainty is adding to his client’s anxiety as they wait for a decision from the court in Georgia.
“Think about yourself, going to a foreign country, trying to get an education there, and then being told that the enforcement authorities want you to leave,” he said. “What would you do?”
At least 50 international students in Connecticut have had their visas revoked, according to officials at UConn and other local colleges. DHS has not disclosed the total number of students affected.
In a statement posted online, UConn said previously that “while the number of impacted students here is small, consequences for those impacted are significant.”
UConn says it is regularly monitoring the database of international students used by DHS. Once UConn notices a change on a student’s status, the university alerts the student or visiting scholar and offers them support services. The university also notifies the student or scholar’s department head and dean.
In February, UConn also established a “rapid response team” to address immigration policy changes that could affect colleges and universities.

(J. Alex Wilson | Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia)West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Beth Walker will retire June 27 after more than eight years on the bench. Walker wrote of her retirement in a letter to Chief Justice William Wooten on Monday. 
“While serving the people of West Virginia has been the greatest honor of my life, I now do my part to usher in a new generation of leadership while spending more time with my family, friends, and pursuing other interests,” Walker wrote. 
Walker was elected to the high court May 10, 2016, the first in a nonpartisan race, and took office Jan. 1, 2017. 
Walker is currently the longest-serving justice on the court. She’s the last remaining justice who was part of the court in 2018, when all four sitting justices faced impeachment charges relating to the misuse of public funds. Walker was charged with maladministration. The state Senate censured Walker at the time but voted not to remove her from office. Former Justice Allen Loughry was ultimately sentenced to two years in federal prison after pleading to 10 federal charges, including wire and mail fraud. 
Walker served as chief justice in 2019 and 2023.
In her letter Monday, Walker wrote that during her tenure, the Supreme Court restored public trust in the judicial branch by “increasing transparency, accountability and impartiality while returning the focus of the judiciary to the rule of law.”
“We have established a cooperative and functioning relationship with both the legislative and executive branches, which I hope endures for years to come,” she said.
Walker was raised in Huron, Ohio, and graduated from Hillsdale College and the Ohio State University, where she earned her law degree. Prior to becoming a judge, she worked for the Bowles Rice law firm, practicing in labor and employment law and mediation. 
In a news release Monday, Wooten called Walker an “outstanding member” and a leader of the Supreme Court. 
“This is in part due to her institutional knowledge, being our longest-serving justice, but the real foundation of her leadership is her judicial temperament and intellect,” Wooten said.
“In some appellate courts in other jurisdictions — and in this court at different times — the internal deliberations have been caustic and acrimonious.That has never happened in our court because Justice Walker has been a force insisting on collegiality and civility among our members. 
“Her leadership in this area has been a real strength of our court,” he said. “While I would like to persuade Beth to remain on the court, I will respect her judgment. Nonetheless, I sincerely regret that Justice Elizabeth Walker will very shortly cease to be a member of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.”
Walker’s term was set to expire Dec. 31, 2028. Gov. Patrick Morrisey is expected to appoint someone to fill Walker’s seat until her replacement can be elected during the next judicial election in 2026. 
Prior to the appointment, the state’s Judicial Vacancy Advisory Commission will collect applications, conduct interviews and make recommendations to the governor, a spokesman for the Supreme Court said.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Legislature is considering several proposals that would create tax breaks and new revenue streams for college athletes and their sports programs. 
If passed in their current state, the proposals would exempt college athletes from income taxes on their name, image and likeness (NIL) deals and would create a new fund to give tax dollars to NCAA Division I athletics programs like LSU’s. 
But critics say the Republican-backed proposals are doing something antithetical to their party’s free-market philosophy. They also argue the bills could further widen the divide — cultural and fiscal — between academics and athletics.
The change could also come at the expense of priority services the state provides, such as early childhood education
‘The need is so high’ 
House Bill 639 by Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, would increase the tax on sports gambling from 15% to 32.5%, aligning it with the tax on video poker machine wagers. Increasing the tax rate on sports gambling has support from both conservative and progressive corners, both of whom want to use the revenue to offset the “social ills” of gambling.
But Riser’s bill goes further, altering the revenue split and putting 25% into a fund that would benefit student-athletes at public schools that compete at the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision and Football Championship Subdivision levels. That includes UL Lafayette, UL Monroe, Louisiana Tech, LSU, Grambling, McNeese, Nicholls, Northwestern, Southeastern and Southern. 
The University of New Orleans, which does not have a football program, would be left in the cold. 
“The need is so high,” Riser said in an interview with the Louisiana Illuminator and Tiger Rag. “When you start talking about the SEC, talking about any level of athletics right now, it’s changed so dramatically.” 
“Even like ULM … just to be competitive [in recruiting], it takes facilities, when you’re dealing with [athletes] they require you to have all those things,” Riser said. 
A frequent adage about LSU athletics is that it doesn’t get any state funding, which isn’t strictly true. The department notably received $1 million in cash from the state in 2023 to plan for improving or replacing the Pete Marravich Assembly Center and occasionally receives small-dollar amounts for various state-funded projects. 
But Riser’s fund could change that. The state currently brings in approximately $54 million annually in sports gambling revenue. If his bill passes, the state’s take would increase to approximately $116 million, with about $30 million dedicated to college athletics. 
That’s a huge amount of money in the context of college athletics in Louisiana. Only LSU has a budget larger than that, with most other FBS and FCS schools in Louisiana bringing in only half or a third as much. 
Even with heavy subsidies to small programs like Nicholls and Grambling, you can expect LSU to line up to receive its share of the revenue. 
Presently, the state’s split for sports gambling tax revenue calls for 25% to go toward early childhood education, 10% to local governments and the rest goes to gambling addiction programs and other projects. 
Under Riser’s bill, after college athletic departments get their 25%, an additional 3% goes to the Louisiana Postsecondary Inclusive Education Fund, which finances programs for students with disabilities, and the rest goes into the state general fund that can be used for a variety of government needs. 
Taking money away from early childhood education and gambling addiction programs is certain to ensure a fight over Riser’s bill. 
“Legalized mobile gambling has created or exacerbated many social and cultural problems, including addiction, bankruptcies, and even increases in domestic violence,” said Peter Robins-Brown, executive director of the progressive organization Louisiana Progress. “New tax revenue should be used first and foremost to address some of those problems before we talk about spending more money on college sports.” 
And dedicating state money to college athletics might be a hard sell at a time when lawmakers are digging into couch cushions to find the change necessary to prevent a K-12 teacher pay cut.

NIL tax breaks
Two pending bills would exempt athletes’ NIL compensation from state income tax. 
The most notable proposal is House Bill 166 by Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, which would exempt the entirety of athletes’ NIL income from the state taxes. McMakin, an LSU alum whose father played baseball for the Tigers in the 1970s, said he proposed the legislation because LSU is competing for athletes against states like Texas that don’t have a state income tax. 
McMakin said the measure is appropriate in light of the economic impact athletes have on the state. LSU athletics generated $500 million for the state in the 2021-22 academic year, according to a university study. 
But what might be considered the academic parallel to paid student-athletes — graduate assistants — would still be subject to state income tax. 
Several graduate students interviewed raised objections to this double standard, which Jan Moller, executive director of Invest in Louisiana, said is a valid concern. His organization advocates for policies that benefit lower- and middle-class citizens. 
LSU covers tuition for graduate assistants and pays them a stipend for the work they do, such as teaching freshman classes and conducting research. Unlike student-athletes, grad assistants have to pay for their own housing, meals and health care on their meager stipends – expenses that are all paid for college athletes on full scholarships. 
“They are subsidizing entertainment over academics at the expense of academics,” said biology graduate student Cullen Hodges. 
“It’s not the government’s role to subsidize millionaire college athletes when we can’t provide basic services to our citizens,” Moller said. 
McMakin said if graduate assistants wanted to present evidence of their economic impact, he’ll “happily” add them to his bill. In 2022, LSU research, much of it done or assisted by graduate students, had a $1.3 billion economic impact. 
The proposal is bad tax policy, Moller said. 
“It’s conservatives who will always say that we shouldn’t pick winners and losers with our tax policy,” Moller said. “What is this if not picking winners and losers?” 
A second proposal, House Bill 168 by Rep. Rashid Young, D-Homer, would exempt the first $12,500 of athletes’ NIL income from state taxes. That aligns the exemption with the standardized deduction offered to every other Louisiana resident. It’s not clear if this legislation is necessary for the athletes to receive the deduction, but Young said he wanted to make sure they get it. 
Young, a former Grambling football player, said he also supports McMakin’s bill. 
“Top athletes are leaving the state of Louisiana because they’re getting better deals in other states that … don’t have any income tax,” Young said in an interview. “We need to start trying to get in the game.” 
Young’s bill also creates an income tax deduction for taxpayers who enter into NIL deals with college athletes. It was designed to encourage small businesses to get in the name, image and likeness game, he said 
Young has also proposed a resolution that would create a task force to study the need for increased transparency on NIL and related issues. LSU Athletic Director Scott Woodward, and other Division I athletic directors in Louisiana, would be members of the task force, as well as student-athletes, state legislators and three representatives of the private sector. 
Other athletics proposals
Sen. Jeremy Stine, R-Lake Charles, wants to “Make American Athletics Great Again.” His proposed Senate Bill 200 would prohibit athletic departments in Louisiana from giving more than 25% of their scholarships and financial assistance to international athletes. 
About 23% of LSU’s scholarship athletes are international students, according to data LSU athletics spokesman Zach Greenwell provided. 
Just three schools — McNeese, ULM and UNO — are above the proposed 25% rate. Stine’s bill does not address what would happen to these athletes. He did not respond to an interview request for this report. 
House Concurrent Resolution 13 by Rep. John Illg, R-River Ridge, calls on the Southeastern Conference to schedule LSU home games in September after 6 p.m. to account for the intense heat. Illg’s resolution only mentions LSU, ignoring the other football programs in Louisiana that also compete in the heat.

While off-year elections typically draw less attention than those on even-numbered years, the upcoming primaries will determine which candidates advance in a host of local and statewide races that will be held in November.
Pennsylvania has a closed, partisan primary system. That means only voters registered as Democrats or Republicans, respectively, will have a chance to cast a ballot for which of their party’s candidates will advance to the general election in November.

What’s on the ballot
Which elections are being held this year will vary across different parts of the state. Many municipalities will hold elections for city and county commissioners, school board members, township supervisors, Court of Common Pleas judges and other elected positions. 
In some cities, like Pittsburgh, Lancaster and Harrisburg, voters will be able to cast a ballot in their Mayoral primary.
Some counties will also have judicial elections for their Court of Common Pleas, the state’s lower courts.
Residents in counties like Allegheny, Montgomery and Philadelphia will be able to decide on several “ballot questions” in May. Voters do not have to be registered with any particular political party to cast these votes.
There are also statewide races. 
On May 20, voters in their respective parties’ primaries will choose who to nominate for seats on the Commonwealth and Superior Court. These are the appellate courts in Pennsylvania’s judicial system — the ones that rule on appeals and decisions from the lower courts, but sit beneath the state Supreme Court. Justices serve 10-year terms.
Three Democratic state Supreme Court justices are also up for retention elections this year, but not until November. Then, voters will be able to decide whether those justices should keep their seats on the bench.
Voters can check what will be on their ballots by contacting their local election offices, listed here. 
How to register and who can vote
Eligible voters can register to vote at vote.pa.gov. Registered voters can also check where they are registered and with what party.
Primary voters must be 18 years-old and residents of the district they wish to vote in for at least 30 days ahead of the primary. Voters must also be U.S. citizens for at least a month before the election.
Pennsylvanians can also register at their county’s registration offices, and some other locations like Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program offices, armed forces recruitment centers and some PennDot offices when obtaining a new driver’s license or state ID.
Because primaries are closed and partisan, voters must also be registered to the party they wish to cast ballots for in these elections. Non-partisan ballots will be available for voters not registered to any party in locations with ballot questions or other non-partisan elections.
Prospective voters with questions should contact their county’s election offices.
How to vote
Registered voters who wish to cast their ballot in person on May 20 can find their polling place at this website. Voters casting a ballot for the first time in their district will need to show a valid ID.
Voters may also register for absentee or mail ballots, which every voter is eligible for. In order to vote in the May 20 primary, however, voters must have their completed absentee ballot registration received by their county election office by 5 p.m. on May 13. 
To apply for an absentee ballot, voters must provide a valid driver’s license or PennDOT ID. If they don’t have those, they must provide the last four digits of their social security number and a signature, which can be uploaded online. 
Applications for mail ballots can be submitted online at this website.
All mail ballots must be returned by 8 p.m. on May 20.

Tom Emmer (R-MN) speaks during a news conference on the results of the 2024 election outside of the U.S. Capitol Building on November 12, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)On Sunday, U.S. House Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota’s 6th Congressional District repeatedly dodged straightforward questions about whether the U.S. president has the legal power to “deport” U.S. citizens, or whether he would be supportive of such a move.
The question has arisen recently, as President Donald Trump suggested his administration could “deport” U.S. citizens. 
“The homegrowns are next,” Trump said last week during a meeting with El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele. 
CNN’s Dana Bash asked Emmer, who is also the House GOP whip, about the issue during his appearance the network’s State of the Union talk show.
“Do you think the federal government has any legal authority to [deport] American citizens?” 
Emmer declined to answer the question, instead offering a lengthy response about the administration’s ongoing enforcement actions against non-citizens.
Bash tried several times to steer Emmer back to the question of U.S. citizens. “What about the idea that the White House says it is looking into, whether or not U.S. citizens who are convicted of violent crimes can be imprisoned in El Salvador?” she asked. Emmer once again dodged and attempted to steer the discussion back toward the treatment of non-citizens.
Bash gave it one more try: “I just want to give you one more chance to say whether or not you’re okay with U.S. citizens — the idea of it. I know it’s not happening. But he has actively said more than once that they are looking into it. Would you be okay with that?”
Emmer, for a third time, refused to answer.
To be perfectly clear: The Constitution does not grant the president the power to “deport” U.S. citizens or imprison them in foreign countries.
“It is pretty obviously illegal and unconstitutional,” said Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School.
“It’s obviously unconstitutional, obviously illegal,” said David Bier of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank based in D.C.
“The U.S. government cannot deport a U.S. citizen for any reason,” said U.C. Davis law professor Gabriel Chin.
The episode represents a remarkable about-face on civil liberties for Emmer, a man who used to commemorate Constitution Day on social media, and who once took to the floor of the U.S. House to read the portions of the 6th Amendment that protect the rights of the criminally accused. 
Not long ago, Emmer publicly argued that efforts to protect Americans’ safety needed to be balanced against Constitutional safeguards of individual liberties. “We must protect this country, but cannot do so by circumventing the Constitution,” he said in a July 2016 explanation for why he voted against renewing the Patriot Act.

Last fall, Iowa joined 19 other states and representatives of the nursing home industry in suing the Biden administration to block the implementation of new staffing requirements for taxpayer-funded nursing homes.
The new standards would eventually require homes to conduct assessments of their residents’ needs, provide 3.48 hours of direct nursing care per resident, per day, and require then to have a registered nurse available 24 hours per day, seven days a week.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, seeks to overturn those requirements, which were approved last year by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
In their court petition, the 20 states and more than a dozen industry associations argue that the staffing requirements pose “an existential threat to the nursing home industry as many nursing homes that are already struggling will have no choice but to go out of business. And the main victims will be the patients who will have nowhere else to go.”

Nursing home staffing lawsuit
Other plaintiffs in the Iowa-led lawsuit over nursing home staffing include: Nebraska, Kansas, South Carolina, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.
Co-plaintiffs include the LeadingAge lobbying and professional associations in Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Colorado, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Michigan.

Texas judge says CMS lacks authority
The Iowa lawsuit is nearly identical to a suit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas where, on April 7, District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk vacated the new requirements.
Kacsmaryk ruled that while the goals of the new rules were “laudable,” they were not consistent with congressionally approved statutes.
“CMS lacks authority to issue a regulation that replaces Congress’s preferred minimum hours with its own. That is exactly what the 24/7 requirement does,” Kacsmaryk stated in his ruling. “Congress took it upon itself to set the minimum hours nursing homes ‘must use the services of a registered professional nurse.’ It set that level at ‘at least eight consecutive hours a day.’ The 24/7 requirement in effect amends the statute because it strikes Congress’s ‘eight,’ and replaces it with the agency’s ’24.'”
The ruling was not unexpected. When the Texas case was filed, consumer groups noted that Kacsmaryk, who was the only judge to whom it could be assigned, had previously presided in multiple health care cases in which he had ruled against government regulators.
In the Iowa case, which remains active, a judge in January denied the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction to block implementation of the rule. Three weeks ago, CMS filed a brief in the states’ appeal of that decision — signaling that CMS, at least to a certain extent, still backs the new rule, despite the change in administration that took place in January when Donald Trump took office as president.
On the same day CMS filed its brief with the appeals court, the State of Iowa and its co-plaintiffs filed a brief in the underlying case, arguing that even if CMS had been granted the statutory authority to enact such rules, Congress’ delegation of that authority was unconstitutional. “If that authority justifies the rule, there is no limit on what CMS can do,” the plaintiffs argued. “The rule imposes billions of dollars in costs, overrides state laws, and effectively rewrites other provisions of the Medicaid and Medicare statutes.”
Congress poised to block rule 
Some consumer advocates believe CMS, now headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is angling for congressional action to block the new rules, so that government savings from repealing them can be used to partially offset a proposed $880 billion cut in the Medicaid budget.

Given that, as well as the potential for an Iowa court ruling that might conflict with that of Kacsmaryk’s decision, industry officials and GOP lawmakers are pushing for CMS to administratively repeal the rule or for Congress to simply block it.
U.S. Rep. Michelle Fischbach, a Minnesota Republican, told industry lobbyists recently that she believed the staffing mandates threatened rural nursing homes, adding that despite the Texas court ruling she would be pursuing “legislation because we need to make sure this rule is overturned.”
Fischbach first introduced the Protecting Rural Seniors Access to Care Act in 2023, shortly after a preliminary version of the rule was proposed by CMS. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa was a co-sponsor of the bill.
Fischbach reintroduced the bill in February of this year. In the Senate, James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, and Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican, have introduced a similar version of the bill.
Iowa homes cited for lack of staff 
Last year, the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported that Iowa nursing homes had compiled the sixth-worst record in the nation for staffing-level violations. Data from CMS showed that 14% of the state’s 422 nursing facilities were cited for insufficient staffing in fiscal year 2023. That was more than double the national average, which was 5.9%.
Only five other states — Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico and Oregon — had a worse record of compliance with the sufficient-staffing requirement.
Des Moines’ Fleur Heights care facility compiled Iowa’s worst record of compliance.  Over a nine-month period between May 2023 and February 2024, Fleur Heights was cited, but never fined, five times for insufficient staff — more than any other facility in the state.
Federal data suggest many care facilities already meet the new standards, but industry officials allege nursing homes will need to hire an additional 27,000 full-time registered nurses and 78,000 full-time certified nurse aides, at a cost of more than $7 billion, to meet the requirements.
A report from the Long-Term Care Community Coalition earlier this year showed that 6 in 10 of all U.S. nursing homes would have met the new nurse-staffing standard of 3.48 hours in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The fact that a majority of facilities already meet the new minimum standard while still facing quality-of-care issues has been a concern for many advocates who say the new standards don’t go far enough. They point to a federal study that shows each resident needs at least 4.1 hours of nursing care each day – a standard met by only 26% of all nursing homes nationally.
A University of Pennsylvania study recently concluded that the new staffing mandates, if left in place, would save roughly 13,000 lives per year. In Iowa alone, the researchers said, the mandates would save 101 to 250 lives per year.

Ron DeSantis's social media)Two recent top agency appointments by Gov. Ron DeSantis, both of whom have been grilled by legislators over a charity linked to First Lady Casey DeSantis’ Hope Florida initiative, appear unlikely to win confirmation this session from the Florida Senate.
Sen. Don Gaetz, chair of the committee responsible for screening appointees, told the Florida Phoenix in a phone interview Monday that of the more than 200 gubernatorial appointees for the Senate to consider this session, roughly 150 are still awaiting action.
He said the committee lacks time to consider the appointment of Shevaun Harris as head of the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) or Taylor Hatch as secretary of the Department of Children and Families (DCF).
Under Florida law, if the full Senate fails to take action on a confirmation the governor must reappoint them to that post within 30 days. The Senate would then consider the appointment during its next session. Appointees who fail to win confirmation a second time must leave their positions.

“I know this: That because we won’t be able to get to her, her term of office will end and he’ll [DeSantis] have to reappoint her,” Gaetz said of Harris’ future as AHCA secretary.
When asked whether he would vote to confirm Harris at AHCA, the largest of the state’s health care agencies, Gaetz said: “I’d have a hard time voting for Secretary Harris unless she came clean and had a very different story than what she’s telling the House.”
Gaetz also told the Florida Phoenix that he has “serious questions for both of them. They both know it.”
 The process
Gaetz, himself a former Senate president, and committee vice chair Mack Bernard, a Democrat from West Palm Beach, issued a memo outlining how the Senate confirmation process would proceed under Senate President Ben Albritton for the next two years.
The memo explains that every gubernatorial appointee will be considered by their substantive committee as well as the Ethics and Elections Committee.
“A favorable vote of the Ethics and Elections Committee will be required in order for a nominee to be recommended for confirmation by the full Senate,” the memo says. “However, the President always has the prerogative to move any nomination to the full Senate.”
The committee didn’t begin considering gubernatorial appointments until its March 31 meeting, having spent its previously scheduled hearings discussing substantive legislation instead.
“Tuesday comes before Wednesday. Nominees come to us as they come to us,” Gaetz said, noting that he doesn’t get to “pick and choose” the names on the agenda.
Katherine Betta, a spokesperson for the Senate President Ben Albritton, said the governor’s office is aware of the situation.
“The President’s goal is to have a more thorough process for confirmations by broadening the opportunities for Senators to engage in the confirmation process. There is insufficient time remaining this session to move forward with confirmation proceedings for Secretary Harris and Secretary Hatch. The President has great respect for their dedicated and longstanding service to the state, specifically to the vulnerable populations they have both served and continue to serve over their respective careers in state government. The confirmation process provides the opportunity for reappoint and certainly if that occurs, there would be time more time this fall during interim committee weeks and next session for consideration.”
 Backstory
DeSantis put Harris in charge of AHCA in February after he tapped Jason Weida, who had been secretary of that agency, as his chief of staff. Before that, Harris had run DCF, the agency that created the nonprofit Hope Florida Foundation to help Ms. DeSantis’ Hope Florida. DeSantis then appointed Hatch, who had been director of the Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) to serve as head of DCF.
The Hope Florida Foundation, a direct support organization, has been at the center of a growing controversy surrounding a $10 million “one time donation” health care giant Centene made to it. The money was part of a $67 million settlement the managed care plan signed with the state over Medicaid overpayments.
The foundation than gave $5 million grants to Secure Florida’s Future, a nonprofit tied to the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and Save our Society, another political committee. Within days, those groups made contributions to Keep Florida Clean, which opposed last year’s marijuana-legalization initiative. James Uthmeier, the governor’s former chief of staff, now Florida attorney general, controlled Keep Florida Clean.
House Health Care Budget Subcommittee chair Alex Andrade told members of the Hope Florida Foundation during their board meeting last week that the contributions could jeopardize the foundation’s 501(c)(3) status and that the foundation should try to recoup the funds.
The Senate Committee on Children and Families voted up on Hatch on March 25, but she still needs the ethics committee’s nod.
The Senate Health Policy Committee approved Harris’ nomination as AHCA Secretary in April 1. At that same meeting, the committee approved DeSantis’s choices as heads of the boards of Chiropractic Medicine, Medicine, Optometry, and Physical Therapy Practice.
Likewise, the ethics committee will consider a spate of higher education appointees (some of whom are controversial) Tuesday that were considered by the Senate Appropriations Committee on Higher Education on April 15 and April 10, well after Harris and Hatch were initially considered by their substantive Senate committees.

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Photo courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.

Iowa program loses federal funds
The Iowa program that was cut was the Center for Industrial Research and Service at Iowa State University, which partners with other organizations and communities to provide customized services to help businesses grow, according to its website.

The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.
In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

Bill Ramos, D-Issaquah, speaking on the floor on April 16, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington state Sen. Bill Ramos died suddenly Saturday while on a trail run near his home in Issaquah. He was 69.
Colleagues remembered Ramos, a Democrat representing Washington’s 5th Legislative District, as a kind and dedicated public servant. 
“He never let even the most serious matters get too serious,” said Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle. “He made you like him the moment you met him.”
“Bill’s passing is a devastating loss for our caucus and for our state,” Pedersen added.
Ramos, a member of the Latino Democratic Caucus, served in the U.S. Forest Service, Federal Transit Administration and on the Issaquah City Council before joining the Legislature. He was also the longtime leader of Dance All Night in the Cascade foothills, where he taught ballroom, salsa and swing dancing.
His wife, Sarah Perry, is a King County Council member. She called Ramos her “dance partner in life.”
“Bill was a mentor and friend to all who asked, quick with a smile and reassuring word, and always willing to drop whatever he was doing to be of service,” Perry said in a statement. 
She said he often would run through Issaquah’s many trails to “relieve stress during a busy legislative session” and “reconnect to the forests and hills he loved that shaped his career.”
Elected to the state House in 2018, he quickly became one of the Legislature’s leading voices on transportation issues. In the House, he helped author a nearly $17 billion transportation funding package. And in the Senate, to which he was elected in November, he was one of the lead negotiators over the state’s next two-year transportation budget.
Ramos grew up in East Oakland, California. He received his degree in forest sciences from Humboldt State University in California. With the Forest Service, he worked in Washington state, in North Bend and Enumclaw, serving in leadership roles focused on timber and ecosystem management as well as recreation, according to a biography on his legislative website.
From 2005 to 2013, Ramos worked in the Federal Transit Administration as a community planner focused on the Tribal Transit Program. He was also the tribal liaison to the Pacific Northwest’s Indigenous communities.
And directly before joining the Legislature, he was an Issaquah City Council member from 2016 to 2019. In the House, Ramos served as the chair of the State Government and Tribal Relations Committee.
House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, said Ramos worked on legislation “to ensure more effective, accountable, and equitable government for all people in Washington.”
“He was also a tireless champion for improving our transportation system, making our communities safer, and protecting Washington’s natural resources and outdoor spaces,” Jinkins continued.
Tributes poured in for Ramos over the weekend, including from members of Congress and Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson. 
Ferguson remembered last seeing Ramos and Perry a week ago at an event.
“It was a typical conversation with them — big hugs, wide smiles, and lots of laughter,” the governor said. “I will so miss him.”
The Senate began its floor action Monday morning with a moment of silence in honor of Ramos. His desk was covered with flowers.
He is survived by Perry and two adult children, Max and Maya, among others. His wife said she will share more details on services later.
The King County Council has 30 days to appoint Ramos’ replacement from a list of candidates from the local Democratic Party.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1403-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 16:11:22.060978

(Getty Images)Looking ahead to Utah’s hot and dry summer months, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox issued an executive order on Monday to encourage wildfire preparedness across the state. 
The order, according to Cox’s office, is meant to “improve coordination among state, local, and federal partners ahead of the 2025 fire season.”
“I’m incredibly proud of Utah’s firefighters and first responders,” the governor said in a prepared statement. “Their courage and dedication set the standard — and this executive order builds on their work by improving coordination and focusing our efforts where they’re needed most. This is about making sure we’re ready before the next fire season begins.”
The executive order establishes a new working group focused on wildfire management, made up of leaders from state agencies including the Department of Natural Resources, the Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands, the Department of Public Safety, and the Division of Emergency Management.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXCox tasked the group with identifying the highest-risk areas, improving coordination across jurisdictions, and submitting a report that includes recommendations for the governor. He set a deadline of June 1. 
“When it comes to wildfires, the unexpected has become the new normal,” said Jamie Barnes, state forester and director of the Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands.”Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our planning efforts can help reduce risks to watersheds and landscapes across the state – and strengthen our overall wildfire preparedness.”
In his order, the governor also included a call to Utahns to prepare their own families and households for wildfire danger. He recommended:

Have an emergency supply kit, make a plan, and be informed
Review the Utah Fire Sense and Be Ready Utah preparedness campaigns 
Sign up to receive local emergency alerts by visiting your county and city websites
Review and understand your insurance coverage
Know evacuation routes
Don’t forget to include pets and other animals in emergency planning
Gather and protect important documents 
Create a defensible space around your property
Ensure fire hydrants are accessible during all times of the year 
Maintain, update and test smoke detectors and fire suppression systems. 

“In addition to the immediate dangers wildfires pose, Utah also faces serious post-fire risks — including flooding and debris flows — that can devastate communities long after the flames are out,” Cox’s office said in Monday’s news release. “The order acknowledges these threats and calls for a comprehensive, forward-looking approach to mitigation and preparedness.”
The governor’s office also said the executive order “builds on the success” of the Utah Fire Sense Campaign, “which helped reduce human-caused wildfires by nearly 75% from 2020 to 2023.”
“It also reflects the administration’s deep appreciation for the bravery and commitment of Utah’s state, local, and federal firefighters — whose efforts help protect both lives and natural resources across the state,” the office said. 
The executive order took immediate effect when it was signed Monday. It’s set to expire on June 1.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As Republicans in Congress consider cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, states are weighing numerous options to scale back their programs. But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.












Now, as we're staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid … our state is hamstrung.


– South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson




“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson was one of the lead sponsors of a bill adopted by the Legislature that will ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they will fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

How that might harm special education,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/04/special-education-2/,Special education is shifting to a different federal agency. Advocates fear the loss of expertise will harm students.,"In summary
Special education is shifting to a different federal agency. Advocates fear the loss of expertise will harm students.


President Donald Trump has promised to keep special education intact, even as he dismantles the federal department that has overseen it for nearly a half century. But some experts and parents in California fear Trump’s policies will imperil the program on multiple fronts, and undoing decades of progress for disabled students.
“Students in special education are equally as important as students who aren’t, but that hasn’t always been the case. The disability community has fought hard for where we are now,” said Gina Gandolfi, a former special education teacher in San Bernardino County whose 10-year-old son has Down syndrome. “What if those services are taken away? Kids with disabilities will go back to being second-class students.”
Last month, Trump said he’s moving special education from the Department of Education, which he’s described as wasteful and inefficient, to the Department of Health and Human Services, under the direction of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Enforcement of special education laws would likely move to the Justice Department. Although the laws surrounding special education wouldn’t change, there’s likely to be disruptions as the program moves to a new department, especially one not focused on education and that’s undergoing a 20% reduction in its workforce.

Advice to California schools on Trump’s DEI crackdown: Do nothing — yet 

by Carolyn Jones 





More than 40 disability rights groups sent a strongly worded letter to Congress in early April imploring members to preserve special education funding, keep the program in the Department of Education and leave the department intact. The authors said the plan to move special education to Health and Human Services is “short-sighted, insulting and unacceptable.”
Trump has not announced cuts to special education funding, and Congress left its funding intact in the most recently passed budget. But at the same time, Trump has threatened to cut school funding to states — including California — that defy his orders to eliminate diversity programs or scrap protections for transgender students. The federal government currently covers about 10% of California’s total cost for special education.
Beyond school funding, Republicans in Congress are debating cuts to Medicaid, which would have a deep impact on services for students with disabilities and their families. School districts use Medicaid to help pay for speech and occupational therapy and mental health services for students with disabilities. In addition, parents with disabled children rely on California’s regional centers — funded in part by Medicaid — for diagnoses, in-home visits, equipment like wheelchairs and walkers and other services.
Impacts on special education services
Cuts to any of those programs would have a cascading effect that would upend the disability community, said Kristin Wright, former director of special education for California and currently the executive director of prevention, intervention and inclusive practices at the Sacramento County Office of Education.
For example, if families lose services from a Medicaid-funded agency such as a regional center, they may have to quit working to care for their disabled child. That could potentially catapult a family into poverty. 
“It’s a fragile ecosystem,” Wright said. “These programs have evolved together. When you pull any one strand away, it affects everything else.”
Wright fears that the changes would set special education back decades. Until the 1970s, when the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act passed, many children with disabilities didn’t attend school at all. And for many years, they were often in separate classrooms, segregated from their classmates without disabilities. Now, in California, most students with disabilities spend the majority of their time in general education classes, with the assistance of aides and other supports, where they tend to do better academically and socially.
“We’ve come so far, moving away from pathologizing people and using a medical model of disability toward a social model, where disability is seen as a natural part of the human condition,” Wright said. “This feels like we’re backpedaling. As a society, we’re going to have to decide what we care about, and how committed we are to educating every student.”

About 14% of K-12 students in California are enrolled in special education, with disabilities ranging from mild learning disorders to severe autism or traumatic brain injuries.
Typically, students receive extra services from therapists, aides and special education teachers, which can be costly. California spent about $13 billion on special education last year, with about 10% coming from the federal government. That doesn’t include money that schools get from Medicaid. If Medicaid is cut, schools would have to find the money elsewhere.
Effects on schools
Ginese Quann is a special education director for the El Dorado County Office of Education and oversees the Special Education Local Plan Area, a cost-sharing consortium for 464 California charter schools. Quann said she’s not overly worried about the federal changes — yet.
Special education funding has always been in flux, she said, and the state has its own systems for monitoring and enforcing the program. Even if the federal government cuts its enforcement of special education laws, she said, parents will still be able to file complaints with the state.
She’s less sure about the transition to the Department of Health and Human Services. Even in a best-case scenario, there’s likely to be some disruptions in payments or services, she said. In a worst-case scenario, the program will be overseen by people with little expertise in how to educate students with disabilities.
The best she can do, Quann said, is to “try and cushion schools from changes at the federal level, so ideally there’s no impact on students. I see this as our biggest challenge right now.”

But even minor disruptions could be damaging for schools that rely on a smooth-running special education system. One of those schools is the Hanna Academy, a small nonprofit boarding school in Sonoma County that contracts with school districts to serve students with acute behavioral challenges. Federal changes to special education could have lasting effects on students, and jeopardize students’ and staff safety, said principal Courtney Jackson.
The academy, which opened in 1945, serves about 50 students from around California. The students receive extensive therapy, vocational training and academic and life-skills classes, delivered in small groups with numerous teachers and aides who can intervene when students have meltdowns or violent outbursts. 
Budget cuts will likely mean fewer adults in classrooms, which could endanger students as well as staff. It also means students won’t get the individual attention they need and their progress will almost certainly drop off, Jackson said. 
“We’re dealing with the most delicate population in education. When you start removing services in a careless manner, without a backup plan, it just causes chaos,” Jackson said. “The damage will be so deep, it could take years to fix and be far more expensive.”
Future of special education law
Special education has traditionally had bipartisan support, with champions in both parties. The Trump administration has promised to leave special education unscathed, but that would require continued funding, said Rorie Fitzpatrick, vice president for K-12 systems at the nonprofit research and consulting firm WestEd.
“The biggest concern is the future of IDEA,” Fitzpatrick said, referring to the 1975 legislation that created special education. “Students with disabilities have a right to a free, appropriate public education under the law. But you need well-trained staff and funding to make that happen. If you cut that funding, you’re gutting IDEA by default.” 
Gandolfi, whose son has Down syndrome, said special education has made a world of difference for her son, Nathan, a fourth grader in Redlands Unified. He loves his friends in his general education classroom, and gets extra services like speech and occupational therapy, one-to-one classroom support and academic help through special education. Through the local regional center, he attends classes in swimming, drumming and social skills, as well as camps. He loves hip hop dance, movies, singing and his two younger siblings.
“He’s living his best life. He’s full of joy. He looks forward to school every day,” Gandolfi said. “We want him to have a long, purposeful, meaningful life, and having the support of special ed makes that possible.”

Wiley Nickel spoke at a packed “empty chair” town hall for Sen. Thom Tillis in March. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Democratic former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel has raised $2.4 million this year in his quest to oust Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in the 2026 election.
Last week marked the Federal Election Commission’s most recent quarterly filing deadline for the period between Jan. 1 and March 31 — the first complete period following the 2024 election in November.
Nickel’s haul was a notable increase over last quarter, when he raised less than $3,000. After spending nearly $2 million this year, he has about $520,000 left on hand.
Nickel, who declined to run for a second U.S. House term due to gerrymandering heavily favoring a GOP victory in his district, formally launched his campaign against Tillis earlier this month. He’s the first Democrat to officially declare his candidacy for the seat.
The numbers are still dwarfed by Tillis, who has the incumbent’s advantage a year and a half out from the election.
He reported raising more than $5.6 million during the filing period and spending nearly $2.5 million, leaving him with just over $4 million in the bank.
North Carolina’s 2026 Senate race is anticipated to be one of the nation’s most competitive and expensive. As he seeks his third term, Tillis is the only Republican senator up for reelection in a 2024 swing state.
It’s a must-win for Democrats, who would need to retain all of their incumbents and win four additional seats to become the majority party.
As a more moderate member of his party, Tillis has come under fire for breaking from MAGA guidelines. As such, he risks a primary challenger from a Trump-endorsed candidate.
He’s possibly found one in Don Brown, a lawyer from Charlotte who has provided aid to clients participating in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and who embraces a an aggressively pro-MAGA agenda, according to his campaign website.
Brown raised $21,600 in the first quarter. That’s not an insignificant amount for a largely unknown first-time candidate whose team filed paperwork to enter the race in February — halfway through the filing period. These contributions came from 18 individuals who donated between $250 and $3,500 each.
Having spent just under $2,000 during the period, Brown has about $20,500 remaining on hand.
Andy Nilsson, a retired businessman and former candidate for lieutenant governor, declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination at the start of the year. Nilsson did not file a campaign finance report for the quarter.
On the Democratic side, the party is eyeing former Gov. Roy Cooper for a run. Cooper, who left the executive mansion in January, has yet to announce his intentions.
Aside from North Carolina, it looks like Democrats’ most viable pick-up opportunities in 2026 could be Maine, where GOP Sen. Susan Collins is running for her sixth term, and a special election in Ohio to replace Vice President JD Vance.
In addition to already holding the majority in the chamber, the map is more favorable for Republicans. The party could seize seats in the battleground states of Georgia and Michigan, where Sen. Gary Peters’ retirement leads to an open seat.
Democratic Sens. Tina Smith of Minnesota and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire have also announced their retirements. This means the party will need to recruit candidates to hold on to those seats.

David Rowe wants to make it easier for sportsmen to register to vote,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/general-assembly/state-rep-david-rowe-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-sportsmen-to-register-to-vote/,His proposal would make voter registration applications available when someone applies for a hunting or fishing license.,"A hunter walks across a field. (Getty Images)State Rep. David Rowe (R-Union) represents a lot of sportsmen in the rural 85th state House District, which includes parts of Union, Juniata, and Mifflin counties and all of Snyder County. He wants to see them more engaged with the electoral process and is planning on introducing legislation that aims to make it easier for them to register to vote.
The Sportsmen Voter Registration Act, which Rowe is dubbing the proposal, would ensure the availability of voter registration applications any time someone of voting age applies for a hunting or fishing license in Pennsylvania.
“Pennsylvania’s hunters and anglers are some of the most engaged citizens in our state, but too often their busy seasons in the field and on the water make it harder for them to register to vote,” Rowe wrote in a press release announcing the proposal. “This legislation ensures Pennsylvania sportsmen have greater access to voter registration, so they can have a voice in the policies that impact our land, wildlife, and way of life.”
Rowe said there is a “remarkably high number of sportsmen” who are not registered to vote in Pennsylvania. Vote4America, a group that supports President Donald Trump and aims to encourage hunters to vote, estimated that 30% of sportsmen in Pennsylvania are not registered to vote, which was more than other swing states in the previous election.

“It really sparked an idea for me that we needed to make it easier for sportsmen to be able to be part of the democratic process,” Rowe told the Capital-Star.
Rowe said the objective would be to “simply streamline the process” for sportsmen to make registering to vote more accessible.
“The bill will not complicate the process of getting a license. The bill will not add another step to the hunting license process,” Rowe said. “Rather, it will simply make it more accessible. So, for sportsmen that are going to a state office, there will be paper registration forms available for them to simply grab.”
He also said there would be an additional link that would provide the option to register to vote for those online who are sportsmen updating their licenses.
In Sept. 2023, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced eligible Pennsylvanians would be automatically registered to vote when they renew their driver’s licenses or ID cards at PennDOT driver and photo license centers, calling it a “commonsense step to ensure election security and save Pennsylvanians time and tax dollars.” This has been referred to as the “motor-voter” system in the state.
“You look at the hobbies of sportsmen and fishermen, hunters, whether it has to do with hunting license fees or wildlife management or trespassing laws, the state has a lot of jurisdiction over those fees and hobbies that these sportsmen enjoy,” Rowe said. “So, we should absolutely be encouraging these sportsmen to be part of the process that elects the officials that make the decisions that impact their way of life.”
Lauren Cristella is the President and CEO of Committee of Seventy, a government reform group.
“We’re all for anything that makes it easier for Pennsylvanians to register to vote, especially when things at the national level are trying to complicate that and limit access,” Cristella said.
Cristella says she believes that the “motor voter” law in Pennsylvania has been successful and thinks it’s great to make it easier for those acquiring hunting and fishing licenses to register to vote.
“I would love to see it when people interact with any government agency,” Cristella said. She referenced Medicare and barbers acquiring licenses through the state as a few examples where the state could encourage more people to register to vote.
While Cristella supports this effort, she ultimately believes that automatic voter registration should be passed and implemented.
“So that we don’t have to rely on individual, piecemeal efforts like this,” she said.

Are other states doing this? 
The goal of increasing voter registration for sportsmen and women is not new in the United States, according to the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation (CSF). The organization, which is dedicated to “protecting and enhancing the rights of hunters, anglers, recreational shooters, and trappers across the nation,” said the issue of voter registration was introduced at an annual meeting in 2004 by a Georgia legislator.
CSF describes “sportsmen/voter” efforts as being based on the “Motor/Voter” concept and noted that some states allow hunting or fishing licenses to be used as proof of eligibility to vote.
The organization encourages legislators and elected officials to explore and support similar efforts. It reports that sportsmen’s caucuses in Florida and Virginia have passed similar legislation regarding the matter, while at least eight other states have made attempts to, as well. CSF also references Georgia, New York, and New Jersey as states that have “successfully passed and enacted voter registration legislation.”
 
What’s next for this proposal?
Rowe said he’s talked to several of his colleagues on the GOP side of the House that are “very excited” about the idea and added he’s had conversations with “one or two” of his Democratic colleagues who are also “interested in the idea.”
“I think that we can all agree that our republic does better…the more people that are involved with the process, the better,” Rowe told the Capital-Star.
Democrats hold a one-seat majority in the state House and would ultimately determine which committee the proposal would be assigned to, Rowe said, but thinks it would either go through the Game & Fisheries Committee or the State Government Committee.
He would like to formally introduce the legislation in the near future.
“Nobody in the General Assembly should be opposed to registering more Pennsylvanians to vote, and so I would love to see this be a consensus issue,” Rowe said, adding that he hopes it could be part of the negotiation process this budget cycle.
“We could maybe see this bill be part of a compromise solution that allows us to get something bipartisan done right out of a Republican Senate, a very closely divided Democrat House, and Democrat governor,” Rowe added.
He didn’t want to engage in any hypothetical scenarios, but Rowe, acknowledging compromise is common in the legislative process, said “potentially some other demographics that we are trying to engage to be part of the electoral process,” could be a part of the conversation surrounding this proposal.
Cristella told the Capital-Star that she’s aware of numerous conversations happening right now with the Pennsylvania General Assembly revolving around a variety of election reforms, which include voter ID, open primaries, and mail-in ballot pre-canvassing. She thinks that there’s a “decent chance” that a compromise voter ID bill will garner enough support to pass.
“And then the exact combo of what other things might be given in exchange for that is up for debate,” Cristella said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hunter-field-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 15:10:21.282825

Gretchen Whitmer gave her support for cell phone restrictions in Michigan schools, with state Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills) reintroducing his plan to keep school children off their phones and focused on lessons that same day. 
However, members of the Senate Education Committee on Tuesday will hear testimony on a different proposal crafted by its chair, state Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia). 
Slated for introduction on Monday, Polehanki told the Michigan Advance her plan was crafted alongside the governor’s office and has support from the Michigan Department of Education. 
While Tisdel’s plan would place different restrictions on students based on their grade level, Polehanki’s proposal would require a district’s school board or a charter school’s board of directors to develop their own wireless communications device policy to limit cell phone use during school hours and cut down on distractions. 



Tisdel’s plan would: 

Prohibit students in Kindergarten through grade 5 from possessing a wireless communication device on school grounds
Block students in grades six through eight from using a wireless communication device on school grounds during instructional time, breaks between instruction, lunch and recess. 
Bar students in grades nine through 12 from using a wireless communication device during instruction time.

The school board and board of directors can also implement additional restrictions. 



“It’s important to me that our bill is not too prescriptive. I do believe that school districts should have control over exactly what their cell phone policies say. School districts know what’s best for themselves,” said Polehanki, who taught high school for almost 20 years. 
Polehanki’s proposal also includes exceptions for emergency situations, medical devices and devices included in a student’s individualized education plan, and permits a school’s principal to create further exceptions.
“I am personally not comfortable with any legislation that would put an outright ban on a cell phone in the era of the school shootings,” Polehanki said. 
“I just don’t believe in an outright ban, but some schools may choose to do that. But the beauty of this bill is it’s up to them,” she said.
Heading into the 2024-2025 school year, an increasing number of states began implementing or weighing cell phone bans, with the U.S. Surgeon General issuing two advisories on social media use and youth mental health. 
Independent Health Policy Organization KFF reports as of March 5, 2025, nine states had banned or restricted cell phone use in schools, while 16 others, including Michigan, were considering restrictions. 
The Columbia University Department of Psychiatry notes studies have found a link between heavy social media use and depression, anxiety, loneliness, and suicidal ideation.
While cell phone use in classrooms can be a problem, cell phone policies do work, Polehanki said. However these policies need to be understood and enforced, she said, and having district-level policy can help that.

(Madeline Carter/Missouri Independent)Former Missouri Congressman Billy Long received $137,000 in campaign contributions — just enough to pay off a personal loan to his campaign — soon after he was tapped to lead the Internal Revenue Service.
Some of the donations are connected to companies that will be policed by the agency Long has been nominated to run.
According to recently filed financial disclosures, which were first reported on by the investigative journalism site The Lever, Long only raised roughly $36,000 in the last two years.
He was named as President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the IRS in December, and in January received $137,000 in donations. He then paid back the remaining $130,000 in debt from a $250,000 loan he made to his unsuccessful 2022 U.S. Senate campaign.
The donations, and their timing, have renewed criticism of Long’s appointment, which still awaits Senate confirmation. Senate Democrats have already called for a criminal investigation of firms with ties to Long that they allege are involved in fraudulent tax credit schemes.
Among the donors to Long’s campaign are financial advisers from some of those firms.
“When they told Billy he’d be in charge of revenue collection, did they forget to tell him that meant for the American people, not his own bank account?” said Sean Nicholson, a longtime progressive activist and campaign consultant in Missouri.
Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for the liberal watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the timing of the donations and the “explicit knowledge that they’d end up directly in Long’s bank account, it’s hard to see them as anything other than an attempt to curry favor with the future head of the IRS.”
Long did not respond to a request for comment.
After a career as an auctioneer and conservative radio host, Long served six terms representing a Southwest Missouri congressional district. He gave up his seat to run for U.S. Senate in 2022, losing in the GOP primary to now-Sen. Eric Schmitt.
Long then worked for Lifetime Advisors and earned at least $5,000 in income from White River Energy. Both companies have drawn scorn from Senate Democrats, and intense media scrutiny, over their involvement in controversial tax credit programs.
In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a limit on the amount of post-election funds a candidate can use to pay back personal loans. The majority found the limit an unconstitutional restriction on the freedom of speech, while the dissenting justices argued removing it would pave the way for political corruption.
“Even if our broken campaign finance system allows this behavior,” Libowitz said, “it raises serious questions about future conflicts of interest and needs to be addressed in any hearings (Billy Long) has before Congress.”

After several weeks of conducting business at a steady, manageable pace, the North Carolina General Assembly suddenly shifted into high gear. This past week, legislative committees rapidly considered and okayed scores of brand new, never before-heard bills on an array of topics, while at the same time Senate Republicans were unveiling and advancing their proposed version of a new two-year state budget.
So, what is the average lawmaker to do at such a time – especially if you’re not a member of the majority party? For Wake County state Senator Lisa Grafstein, the path has been obvious – read each proposed new law as quickly and thoroughly as possible and do your best ask questions, offer amendments and speak up on behalf of average North Carolinians whose interests are so often ignored.

Pete's doing a great job. Everybody's happy with him.”The New York Times published an article Sunday detailing a second group chat on the encrypted, commercial messaging app Signal, where Hegseth shared information about U.S. military plans.Hegseth, asked during the White House Easter Egg roll on Monday about the latest New York Times report, didn’t deny that he sent messages in another group chat.“What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the Russia hoax, won't give back their Pulitzers, they got Pulitzers for a bunch of lies,” Hegseth said. “As they peddle those lies no one ever calls them on it. See, this is what the media does. They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations.""The New York Times report was the second time in less than a month that Hegseth’s discussion of military operations on the app came to light.Someone on a chat meant to comprise only high-level administration officials accidentally included Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, who published an article in late March on the experience.That group chat included Vice President J.D. Vance, Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and others. In that chat, Hegseth shared a precise timeline of U.S. bombing of Houthi targets in Yemen.The Defense Department’s Office of the Inspector General opened an investigation earlier this month “to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial messaging application for official business. Additionally, we will review compliance with classification and records retention requirements.”The OIG investigation came after U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I., sent a letter to the acting inspector general asking the independent watchdog agency to look into the issue.While Trump and most congressional Republicans continued to back Hegseth, Nebraska Republican Rep. Don Bacon raised concerns Monday about the operational security risk of communicating on “perceived secure applications” like Signal.In a social media post that did not name Hegseth or specifically reference Signal, Bacon wrote that ""admin officials must assume their phones are closely monitored by China & Russia.”“They’re top priority targets.

One month later the policy became law. (Courtesy of Maine Women's Lobby)The state’s paid family and medical leave program will be center stage later this week as both Republicans and Democrats look to modify the new employee benefit. 
The Legislature’s Labor Committee will hold a public hearing Wednesday afternoon for 13 bills to change the program that has yet to take effect for workers but has prompted some pushback among the business community, which has started making payments into the benefit system. The majority of the proposals seek to repeal or scale back the program, but others are looking to clarify the existing law or make it more accessible for employees. 
A bill from Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick) is the only one with bipartisan support. LD 1712 hopes to strike a better balance between employee and employer interests by modifying how much an employer is required to contribute, when an employee needs to apply for the benefit and how much is paid out. 
Though it isn’t expected to be available until May 2026, the paid family and medical leave program will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one or the birth of a new child. 
Proponents have described it as a panacea and a way to make certain jobs more accessible, while opponents argued that certain requirements are too burdensome on employers. 
The Maine Department of Labor finalized the program’s rules in December after an outpouring of input from employees and the business community. At the start of the year, Maine employers began withholding a portion of wages to pay into the new paid family and medical leave fund. 
Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) and Rep. Kristen Cloutier (D-Lewiston), co-sponsors of the original legislation establishing the program, are introducing LD 894 on behalf of the department that would make a series of amendments to the current law to create certain enforcement mechanisms and penalties, as well as clarify intermittent leave. 
Daughtry said she plans to testify in “strong and unequivocal” opposition to the bills that want to delay, weaken, exempt or dismantle the program. Rather than waiting to see how Maine’s paid family and medical leave system operates and then making adjustments based on experience, Daughtry said the bills represent a “reversal of course before the program has had a chance to begin.”
“Maine workers deserve a strong benefits program and I’ll be fighting to protect it,” she said. 
There are two nearly identical proposals to repeal the program entirely. In addition, House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) has two bills to make the benefit voluntary for employers and employees (LD 1273) and delay its start until 2027 (LD 1249). All four pieces of legislation have emergency preambles, which means they would take effect immediately if passed by two-thirds of the Legislature. 
Another emergency proposal from Sen. Russell Black (R-Franklin)would exempt agricultural workers (LD 952). And though not an emergency measure, LD 1400 seeks to exempt certain public school districts and their employees from the benefit program. 
Rep. Mike Soboleski (R-Philips) has a bill (LD 1169) that would allow employers to get a refund for any premiums paid into the state’s plan if they are approved to use a private substitute plan. Sen. Dick Bradstreet (R-Kennebec) is similarly looking to better accommodate employers wishing to use a substitute private plan with LD 1307.
Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford) is proposing an amendment to the state constitution with LD 1221 to prohibit the Legislature from using paid family and medical leave program funds for any other purpose. 
Labor Committee co-chairs Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) and Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) are introducing LD 575 to remove a provision in the current law that requires leave to be scheduled. While that is meant to prevent undue hardship on an employer, the bill title says its removal would create more equitable access to the program. 
Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) is proposing a series of changes with LD 1333 that would seek to clarify the definition of “self-employed individual” and prevent employers from having to bargain with unions over the employee’s share of the program, among other tweaks.

Overdoses in Montana are seeing another spike, and most appear to involve fentanyl, according to the state Department of Public Health and Human Services.
Health officials are reminding Montanans that help is available for recovery and treatment.
In March, Montana saw 95 reports of suspected opioid overdoses, compared to an average of 69 a month in 2024, according to the Department of Public Health and Human Services.
The last time the state saw that number of overdoses in a single month was August 2023, DPHHS said in the news release last week.
“This current overdose spike serves as a startling reminder of the deadly consequences that fentanyl and opioid overdoses have for our communities,” DPHHS Director Charlie Brereton said in a statement.
The agency said data from March 1 to April 15 this year include seven fatal and 132 nonfatal overdoses, and April is on track to have higher-than-average suspected opioid overdoses.
Reviews of case reports indicate most overdoses involved fentanyl, but confirmation through laboratory testing is not always available, DPHHS said. However, it said reviews also show other drug use, including methamphetamine and cocaine.
The health department has focused on increasing access to recovery and treatment programs, it said in the news release. The help includes $400,000 for “Wellness Kiosks” to be installed “throughout the state” and dispense fentanyl testing strips and naloxone.
Health Department spokesperson Jon Ebelt did not respond to questions about which communities would receive the kiosks or the timeline for implementation.
An earlier news release from the Governor’s Office in August 2024 said Montana would install 24 kiosks strategically placed at community-based programs such as drop-in centers.
The Governor’s Office said the initiative aims to combat “an alarming rise” in fentanyl and opioid overdoses.
It said prior to 2020, the state averaged about eight overdose deaths per year, but in 2023, it saw 123 fatal opioid overdoses in Montana, the highest since DPHHS started tracking in 2009.
A recommendation from the Behavioral Health System for Future Generations Commission said pilot programs showed promising results in other states including Nevada and Ohio.
A research study published in the Annals of Medicine in 2022 said the Covid-19 pandemic worsened the “overdose crisis” but naloxone dispensers in Clark County, Nevada, helped.
It said forecasts projected 270 opioid-involved overdose fatalities in the 12 months right after dispensers were made available. But it said just 229 occurred, “suggesting an aversion of 41 deaths.”
“Communities should consider implementing public health vending machines in efforts to prevent opioid-involved overdose fatalities,” said part of the study.
In Montana, money for the kiosks is part of the $300 million the Behavioral Health System for Future Generations Commission is directing to improve behavioral health and developmental disabilities services in the state.
The Health Department said cases in the most recent spike do not appear to be concentrated in any particular county or region, but most are occurring on major transportation routes.
The counties with 10 or more suspected overdoses include Cascade, Flathead, Missoula, Silver Bow and Yellowstone, the news release said.
“DPHHS wants to remind the public that when someone is experiencing an overdose, the timely administration of the emergency medication naloxone may successfully reverse their symptoms and save their life,” said Dr. Maggie Cook-Shimanek of the agency in a statement.



 Suspected overdose

Naloxone reversal may only be temporary, so emergency response should always be activated in instances of suspected opioid overdose, DPHHS said. It directed people here for more information.
Signs of an overdose include:

Loss of consciousness or falling asleep
Small, constricted “pinpoint pupils”
Slow, shallow breathing
Choking or gurgling sounds
Limp body
Pale, blue, or cold skin
Slow to no heartbeat

“If you suspect someone is experiencing an opioid overdose, call 9-1-1 immediately and administer naloxone if it is available,” Dr. Cook-Shimanek said.
DPHHS officials advise that, if you use opioids, make sure a trusted friend or family member is aware, ensure they know how to administer naloxone, and that you have naloxone on hand in the event there is an overdose.

LOUISVILLE — In advance of a hearing Monday afternoon over Jonah Bevin’s effort to intervene in the divorce case of his adoptive parents, former Gov. Matt Bevin and his ex-wife Glenna, a flurry of motions offers sharply different claims about Jonah’s care.
The recent filings even raise questions about Jonah’s age — whether he is 18, as he had believed, or just 17 — because of a conflict in records that recently came to light.
Matt Bevin, in filing Friday, said Jonah’s claims of neglect, abandonment and abuse “are not grounded in fact or law and are, instead, intended to garner media attention and outrage.”
“The truth is entirely different and it is heartbreaking to Matt to see his son caught up in this web,” it said, adding that “Jonah is deeply loved by his entire family” and cites Matt Bevin’s “unshakable love and commitment for his son.”

Glenna Bevin, in a separate filing, said she is “very sad” about the contentious legal proceedings, adding “she loves her son Jonah and wants only the best for him.”
Both Matt and Glenna Bevin are subject to protective orders barring them from contact with Jonah, who sought the orders last month in Jefferson Family Court, alleging they attempted to send him on a hastily arranged trip to Ethiopia, supposedly to meet  his birth mother, whom he believed was deceased.
Dawn J. Post, a child advocate and lawyer representing Jonah, said she has not been able to find any evidence Jonah’s birth mother is alive.
Jonah, in a filing Monday, restates his allegations he was abandoned by the Bevins in Jamaica after child welfare authorities closed the Atlantis Youth Academy for abuse and neglect, removing residents and leaving him for a time in the custody of the Jamaican child welfare system.
“Where is the love my parents said they had for me because they didn’t show it when they left and ignored me. Other parents came to get their kids,” he said in an affidavit. “My parents either lied or left out the truth over and over. Because of that I’ve been on my own. I’ve been trying to speak up because nobody else has done it for me.”
Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela Johnson has scheduled a hearing Monday afternoon to decide whether to permit Jonah to intervene in the Bevins’ divorce case in order to prevent them from reaching a confidential settlement. The Courier Journal also is objecting to keeping such a settlement private, saying court records generally are open to the public.
Meanwhile, Jonah has reported to the court his exact age is in dispute; recently obtained records show he may be only 17 instead of 18, as he previously believed.
“I feel that I am not real,” Jonah said in his affidavit. “No one knows my real age.”
A motion filed Friday by his lawyers says Jonah, who was one of four children adopted by the Bevins in 2012 from Ethiopia, said records the Bevins recently provided show conflicting birth dates.
One of the records the Bevins provided shows Jonah’s birth date as November 2006, which Jonah had thought was his true birth date, and the other, November 2007, the motion said.
If Jonah is just 17, and still a minor, that could affect his pending case, said one of Jonah’s lawyers, John Helmers Jr.
Prior to the recent filings, court records have said the Bevins’ five biological children are adults and that only one of the four adopted children is a minor.
It makes Jonah’s case for intervening in the Bevins’ divorce stronger since the court has a greater responsibility toward minor children, Helmers said in an email.
Matt Bevin’s motion objecting to Jonah intervening in the divorce case dismissed the issue, saying that it was “undisputed” the teen turned 18 in November 2024 and therefore is “emancipated.”
He and Glenna Bevin both ask, in separate motions, that Jonah’s request to intervene as a party in their divorce case be denied.
Jonah, in his affidavit, disagrees, saying his alleged abuse, neglect and abandonment deserve consideration.
“The court can’t just let this go on like it didn’t happen,” it said. “I’m not just a name on paper. I’m a real person. What happened to me was real. Leaving me out of this case says it didn’t happen.”

Carlos Trujillo couldn’t sleep despite it being well past midnight.
As both an immigrant and an immigration lawyer, Trujillo has been acutely tuned into the volatile nature of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. That night, in the early hours of April 11, as has often been the case lately, Trujillo’s mind drifted to worries about how the changes will impact his clients and what he can do to assist them.
Those thoughts weren’t helped by an email that arrived in his inbox at 1 a.m. The opening line got straight to the point.
“It is time for you to leave the United States,” reads the email from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It ends with a promise: “The federal government will find you.”
Trujillo initially assumed the email was for one of his clients. Then he realized the only name on the email was his own.
“I was in a little bit of a shock,” said Trujillo, who became a citizen over a decade ago. “I was like, why is this happening?”

Trujillo is one of several U.S. citizens on the receiving end of what appears to have been a mass email campaign. The emails stated that the recipients’ parole had been terminated. But Trujillo has never had immigration parole, which allows immigrants to temporarily remain and, in some cases, work in the country. It is separate from the kind of parole used in a criminal justice context.
Immigration lawyers in Massachusetts, Ohio, Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, as well as a doctor in Connecticut — all of whom are also citizens — reported receiving the same email as Trujillo.
Customs and Border Patrol said in a statement that it used the “known email addresses” of immigrants to send the notices, which it acknowledged could have included immigration attorneys’ emails.
“If a non-personal email — such as an American citizen contact — was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients,” the statement reads. “CBP is monitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.”
 A broader strategy 

To Trujillo, the motivation behind the emails is clear.
“This is part of a new practice, and the practice is to instill fear in the Latino or the minority communities,” Trujillo said. “Why am I a part of the email? Was it a mistake? Was it that I am born and raised in Venezuela? I don’t know. It could be, because I know there have been mistaken communications by DHS, but because I don’t know — that unknown makes you worry.”
Maria Montes with Comunidades Unidas said the administration’s constantly changing policies have made it difficult for the nonprofit and other organizations to effectively respond within their communities.
“The federal administration has organized a strategy to create chaos, confusion and fear all in the hopes that immigrants will choose to self deport,” Montes said.
Trujillo has been an outspoken advocate for Utah’s immigrant community. He said he refuses to accept that his advocacy was linked to the email, although it did cross his mind. 
“To think that there could be consequences for that in a country like the United States, I just can’t believe it,” he said. “It probably was a mistake, and I love this country so much that I think my first inclination is just to believe that and leave it at that. But if it is something else. Well, here I am. I know who I am and what I stand for. And I understand what this country stands for and I am staying put.”
The emails are part of a broader immigration strategy aimed at revoking visas, asylum, parole and temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants. A specialized immigration task force within the Department of Government Efficiency is providing the technical infrastructure to make that strategy a reality, according to reporting by Politico.
Like other DOGE mass email campaigns, the emails Trujillo and others received incited panic and confusion, especially since immigration notices have historically been sent through U.S. mail and online government portals. Before DHS publicly acknowledged the emails many online wrote them off as a scam.
The switch to email is a recent one, Trujillo said. But his case and that of other citizens who mistakenly received the email call into question the reliability of using email.
Trujillo’s email — which he shared with The Utah Investigative Journalism Project — lists the sender as “automatedmessage@cbp.dhs.gov.” Because the message came from an unrecognized address, it triggered an anti-phishing warning from his Outlook email service.
CBP did not respond to questions about how it is ensuring the notices get to the correct recipients and how many emails it accidentally sent to citizens. Instead, the agency said in a statement that it had issued notices terminating parole for individuals who do not have lawful status to remain in the country.
The statement clarified that those notices were not limited to just individuals who had used CBP One and that the notices do not currently apply to Ukrainian and Afghan immigrants with parole.
“To be clear: If you are an alien, being in the United States is a privilege — not a right,” the statement reads. “We are acting in the best interest of the country and enforcing the law accordingly.”

 ‘It’s heartbreaking’

Trujillo has written off the email as a mistake. But many aren’t so lucky.
Jesus — who The Utah Investigative Journalism Project is referring to by only his first name because he fears speaking out may impact his immigration case — received a letter late last month that terminated his parole and authorization to work in the U.S. Unlike Trujillo, Jesus is not a citizen.
“It literally destroyed me,” Jesus said in Spanish, “Because I’ve tried to do things legally in the U.S.”
The letter, which was shared with The Utah Investigative Journalism Project, directed Jesus, a BYU computer science student, to leave the U.S. by April 24 or face “adverse immigration consequences.”
Jesus applied for asylum in the U.S. after fleeing political persecution in Venezuela. He entered the country legally in November 2023 through the humanitarian parole program. The Trump administration recently ended the program, which had benefited 532,000 people from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua. That decision is currently being challenged in court.
“The phones blew up here,” Trujillo said, adding that over 50 of his clients have gotten letters telling them to leave the country. They range from newly arrived immigrants to individuals who have been in the U.S. for close to a decade.
“It’s heartbreaking,” he said. “You know, these people came the right way, applied the right way, lawfully and orderly, and they’re leaving.”
Trujillo and Montes encouraged immigrants to pursue their case with an immigration attorney, get informed of their rights and be brave about standing up for themselves and their communities.
“There’s never been a scarier time to step up and to push back against such a powerful entity like our federal administration, but there’s also never been a more important time to do so,” Montes said.
Jesus is currently working with his immigration lawyers to stay in the country, but he worries daily of both the consequences of returning to Venezuela as well as the possibility of being detained by U.S. immigration officers.
“My worry is that I go back and the persecution against me starts again,” he said in Spanish. “They could literally kill me.”
All of these developments hit close to home for Trujillo. When he became a citizen, he remembers finally feeling like he had made it, like he didn’t need to worry anymore.
“As an immigrant, you always feel unstable,” he said. “Here I am, 15 years later, and I’m worried about it again.”

Dan McKee has ordered flags at all state buildings and facilities to fly at half-staff and is asking Rhode Islanders to do the same in honor of Senate President Dominick Ruggerio.
The governor’s directive comes as tributes pour in from political figures across the spectrum following Ruggerio’s death early Monday following a battle with cancer. The self-described moderate North Providence Democrat served more than four decades at the State House. 
McKee called Ruggerio a great friend and “true public servant who dedicated his life to lifting up the state he loved.”
“His service and thoughtful leadership have made Rhode Island a better place, and his legacy will leave a lasting impact on our state for generations to come,” the governor said in a statement. “It was my honor to work alongside him.”
Flags are ordered to remain at half staff until Ruggerio’s internment.
Rhode Island Senate President Dominick Ruggerio has died

Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos praised Ruggerio’s leadership on workforce training, lead pipe replacement, and climate resiliency, saying his impact and legacy will be felt for generations.
“Rhode Island will miss him dearly,” she said.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said Ruggerio “displayed true leadership in addressing the state’s most pressing issues, from the opioid crisis to climate change and everything in between.”
“Mr. Ruggerio led until the very end, demonstrating the same courage and tenacity in illness as he did his entire life, because of his steadfast commitment to the health and well-being of Rhode Islanders,” Neronha said in a statement.
Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore said Ruggerio exemplified the qualities of an effective public servant, demonstrating unwavering dedication to his work and a clear set of values that shaped his decisions throughout his career.
“Senate President Ruggerio took on those requirements for more than four decades, serving his constituents and the Senate as a whole with dedication and steadfast leadership,” Amore said.
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed remembered Ruggerio as a “distinguished public servant, a champion for working people and our state, and a dear friend.”
“I will miss Donny’s friendship and his unwavering advocacy for our state and the people who make it a special place,” Reed said in a statement. “Rhode Island is better today because of Senate President Ruggerio’s leadership and dedication.”
U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said Ruggerio’s legacy at the State House will be defined by his decades of forceful advocacy for working people and his practical, highly effective style of legislating.
“Beloved by his North Providence community, Donny was always a pleasure to work with,” Whitehouse said. “I send my deepest condolences to the entire Ruggerio family.”
U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner called Ruggerio “a champion for working people, a skilled legislator, and a true gentleman.” Magaziner, a former state treasurer, said it was an honor to work with Ruggerio on the school construction initiative launched in 2018.
“He understood the importance of investing in the next generation, and the Senate delivered under his leadership,” Magaziner said in a statement.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo called Ruggerio’s passing “a significant loss for Rhode Island” and echoed Magaziner, saying the late senate president championed the state’s working class.
“From infrastructure to labor protections, he believed that our state’s progress is ultimately a result of the hard work of our people,” Amo said.
Ruggerio’s passing has garnered sympathies from across the aisle as well. 
Rhode Island GOP chairman Joe Powers issued an online statement saying his absence “will be felt throughout the State House and across our state.”
“Though we stood on opposite sides of the aisle, I recognize Senate President Ruggerio’s institutional knowledge and leadership during his decades of service in public office and the lasting impact he made on Rhode Island politics,” Powers said. 
Ruggerio’s pro-labor stance was not lost on local unions. Mary Barden, executive director for the National Education Association Rhode Island, called Ruggerio “a steadfast advocate for public education” who was committed to advocating fair wages and strong benefits.
“His leadership left an enduring mark on our state, and he served the Senate with great pride and integrity,” Barden said.
Democratic National Committeeman Joe Paolino Jr., a former mayor of Providence, remembered Ruggerio as “a man of reason” who could find common ground when others saw only differences. Committeewoman Nicole Verdi, who once worked under Ruggerio, thanked her former boss for his mentorship and his leadership.
“I saw firsthand how many people he helped and how deeply he cared about public service, the institution of the Senate, and the state he loved,” she said. “His legacy will live on in the institutions he strengthened and in the lives of so many he worked tirelessly to support and uplift.”
State Party Chair Liz Beretta-Perik thanked Ruggeiro for bringing civility and respect to Rhode Island politics and called him a good friend.
“Anytime I was with him, I felt the kindness and warmth that were his trademarks,” she said. “His Italian heritage reminded me of my grandparents and the values of family and community that I grew up with and cherish.”
Advocates with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Networks have also lent their condolences to the man they said championed efforts to improve public health and increase access to cancer screenings tests.
“Sen. Ruggerio was a resounding voice on so many issues critical to Rhode Islanders and will be sorely missed,” said Ryan Strik, government relations director for the society’s Rhode Island chapter.

Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson announced Friday that they’d renewed their agreement establishing the Wisconsin Federal Nominating Commission to provide recommendations for Congress on nominations for U.S. attorneys and federal judgeships. 
There are currently vacancies for U.S. attorneys in both the eastern and western districts of the state and U.S. Circuit Court Judge Diane Sykes announced she will take senior status, a form of semi-retirement, on Oct. 1, which will require the senators to offer potential nominees for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. 
The commitment to the nominating commission comes as President Donald Trump and Republicans attack the federal judiciary over decisions by judges across the country to limit the president’s authority. 
Both senators said they were confident the commission will find people who can work impartially. 
“I am proud to work with Senator Johnson this Congress to select qualified, impartial candidates to serve our state and faithfully apply the law,” Baldwin said in a statement. “I have full confidence our bipartisan nominating commission will do its job well of rigorously vetting and selecting candidates with the character, expertise, and experience required to fairly deliver justice for our constituents.” 
In his statement, Johnson said the nominating commission must concentrate “on finding individuals who will apply the law and not alter it to fit their ideological or policy preferences.” 
But late last month, Johnson said he supported an effort from U.S. House Republicans, supported by Wisconsin’s GOP representatives, that would limit the ability of federal district judges to impose nationwide injunctions on executive actions. Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that the judiciary was “overstepping its constitutional bounds” by declaring Trump’s actions unconstitutional. 
“They’ve got to discipline, they’ve got to put some guardrails around this,” Johnson said. “This is getting completely out of control.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Senate’s hypothetical, forward-looking leadership succession plan became present-day reality with the death of Senate President Dominick Ruggerio Monday. 
But just as some lawmakers were tight-lipped about Ruggerio’s declining health and the impact of his absences on the chamber prior to his death, they are keeping quiet about the forthcoming election.
Senate Majority Leader Val Lawson and Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian walked out of the room when asked by reporters at a State House appearance Monday when the Senate will elect a new president. Both had stressed the need for privacy during individual remarks minutes earlier.
“It’s fitting first and foremost in the early hours of this loss to focus on the life and legacy of Senate President Dominick Ruggerio,” Tikoian, a Smithfield Democrat, said during the press conference. “And we will accomplish that by providing proper respect, decorum, and tribute, fitting for our Senate president.”
The Senate has cancelled all of its regularly scheduled floor sessions and committee hearings until further notice — at least through the end of the week, Lawson said.
When the chamber reconvenes, its first task will be to choose a new leader. While the majority leader has been the obvious successor in recent history — Ruggerio ascended to the presidency role from majority leader in 2017 — Lawson has not said publicly whether she wants the job. 
Lawson’s time as second-in-command has been brief. The East Providence Democrat was elected in 2018, ascending to majority whip in 2023. In the fall of 2024, Ruggerio brought in Lawson to replace  former Majority Leader Ryan Pearson on the heels of a growing feud between Pearson and Ruggerio rooted in Ruggerio’s health and ability to lead. At the Senate Democrats’ November caucus, Pearson challenged Ruggerio for the president position; he lost, but had the backing of nearly one-third of the Senate’s 34 Democratic members.
Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat first elected in 2012, declined to comment when asked on Monday about his interest in seeking the leadership role in the upcoming election. 
“Today is about remembering Senator Ruggerio,” Pearson said in a text message.
Another name being whispered down State House halls as a possible contender is Sen. Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat who has served 22 years. Ciccone sat in the folding chairs of the Senate Lounge Monday morning as Lawson and Tikoian offered brief tributes to the late Ruggerio.
Ciccone did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
Meanwhile, Sen. Dawn Euer, a Newport Democrat who was believed to be considering a run for president as recently as the fall caucus, confirmed to WPRI-TV 12 Monday that she did not intend to seek the president role. Euer did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
While sitting state senators determine who will be their next president, constituents in Ruggerio’s District 4, spanning northern Providence and North Providence, will elect his successor in a forthcoming special election. The Rhode Island Secretary of State, who oversees state special elections, has not yet set dates, Faith Chybowski, a spokesperson for the office, said in an email on Monday. State law requires open seats to be filled 70-90 days after a vacancy occurs. However, there is flexibility to push the election later within the calendar year if it is “doubtful” that the successor will be chosen in time to complete the legislative session.
The General Assembly returned from its April recess today, and is expected to conclude its annual session by June 30.

,Source New Mexico,2025-04-21 17:17:01+00:00,Source New Mexico,Humanities in Trouble,Darryl Lorenzo Wellington,,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/04/21/humanities-in-trouble/,Former Santa Fe Poet Laureate Darryl Lorenzo Wellington discusses the important role the New Mexico Humanities Council plays,"Humanities Councils play an important role in reaching underserved audiences, poet Darryl Lorenzo Wellington writes. (Getty Images)In early April, state humanities councils in all 50 states received a letter from the infamous DOGE. It read “Your grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities and conditions of the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination” It meant  — simply put — their funding was axed. Many councils had probably foreseen this coming, given prior moves that undermined integrity at the Kennedy Center and the National Endowment of the Arts.

Councils have been in a tailspin since. It’s a cultural domino effect. The federal money humanities councils received would otherwise have been divvied out in smaller grants to libraries, historical societies and museums.

Checking online websites, I see councils across the nation posting heartfelt apologies, alongside lists of programs they will no longer support. That’s bad enough. New Mexico Humanities Council Director Brandon Johnson, however, offers the most dire prognosis: He expects the NM Humanities will have to shut down.

Gone. Utterly gone   — lock, stock and barrel — ending its mission to support relevant work.

Which is? It’s work related to history, philosophy, literature, ethics, media and cultural studies. It’s helping a local art museum fund a special exhibition, exploring Hispano traditions. It’s funding the library to sponsor a special speaker who has just published a book preserving Native American stories. It could be be funds for a public exhibition in which you or your children could participate. It’s providing free access to a lecture on that small piece of history that you feel hasn’t been done justice.

Because that’s what the humanities by definition is: the intellectual study of human culture. The job of councils, on the other hand, is to make these studies available to the general public, regardless of location, and without cost.

I have been a beneficiary of the New Mexico Humanities Council, both as someone seated in the audience, and as an artist/historian. The NM Humanities Speakers Bureau programs sends writers, and artists of various disciplines, to public institutions across the state. I have traveled extensively, delivering lectures on Black American history, especially the Black presence in New Mexico.

It’s a subject many New Mexican have never devoted attention to, given the state’s small Black population. I love watching audiences, who have come to hear me with obvious curiosity, as their eyes light up, exploring new vistas. A Q&A follows every lecture. This is the part that is truly in the Socratic tradition. Knowledge isn’t simply delivered on a silver platter. It’s probed. It’s investigated. It’s put to the test.

However, looking back, the most memorable incident in my lecturing career occurred in a private encounter with an audience member. It was a question from a very young man who said he was college student. He approached me after I finished my talk with an earnest, but worried look. I could tell he had serious intentions. He was very somber, though his question was quite naive.

“I …uh… wanted to ask you something…”

Go ahead, I signaled with a nod.

“Ummm… how do you read books, and enjoy them?”

I was flabbergasted because this wasn’t a question about my subject matter.

He asked me about the roots of studiousness.

I asked: Was he having trouble in school? Was he overwhelmed by books?

He said he was a freshman who until recently had never been required to read so much — or  so extensively.

And he was fascinated by his college subjects.

And he was simultaneously feeling overwhelmed.

I finally answered that all an ideal reader needed to have was passion.

I believed he had this. He was young, with a genuine desire to become a better reader. His commitment wasn’t feigned. He was beginning a lifetime’s worth of scholarship. Stick with it, I said.

I feel proud, looking back, believing my lecture awakened an earnestness inside him, or stirred his desire to read and read and read. I believe in tens of thousands of New Mexicans out there —especially from underserved backgrounds — waiting to be stirred, provoked or inspired in the same way.

Reaching them is a mission that must be restored, by reinvesting in humanities councils, or else we will give the phrase “the closing of the American mind “a new meaning.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-04-21 14:18:24.619204

We’re now three months into the second Trump administration and, as so many experts had feared and warned, the chaos – in the global economy, in the federal government, in our courts, and on the ground in scores of communities across the nation – is palpable. Between the seemingly random economic tariffs, massive and crude cuts to public services, and cruel and unlawful treatment of lawfully present immigrants, the national mess is already looking as if will be bigger than it was during the first Trump administration.

It also would generally apply across state agencies. Jan. 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The anticipated debate on whether Nebraska lawmakers will define “male” and “female” in state law, largely for school bathrooms and sports, kicks off Tuesday afternoon, with one conservative holdout no longer “leaning” in opposition.
Debate on Legislative Bill 89, the “Stand With Women Act” from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, is set to begin Tuesday by 3 p.m. for up to four hours of debate. LB 89 seeks to restrict bathrooms, sports teams and locker rooms at public K-12 schools and colleges, or in the case of private schools competing against public schools in sports, to individuals’ sex at birth.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista, who sets the Legislature’s daily agenda, has designated LB 89 as “controversial and emotionally charged,” meaning half the debate time as other bills.
‘Those are your rights’
Under a proposed committee amendment, sex would be defined as whether someone “naturally has, had, will or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports and utilizes” either eggs (female, woman or girl) or sperm (male, man or boy) for fertilization.

In addition to schools, state agencies would need to generally enforce any applicable rules, regulations, administrative decisions or duties according to someone’s sex.
Kauth said she has been told by some of her Democratic colleagues that she has “no idea what’s in store” for LB 89’s debate, that it could be “pretty aggressive and brutal.” Still, she said she remains grateful for her colleagues who will stand with her and that she is “cautiously optimistic” that she will have 33 votes, the threshold needed to shut off debate after four hours.
Kauth said families have reached out to her since she introduced the issue for the first time in the Legislature two years ago. Some of them “fear being bullied” by teachers and administrators, Kauth said.
“They don’t want to be looked at as mean, and it is never mean to want to have your privacy and your safety and your opportunity protected,” Kauth said. “Those are your rights.”
‘Creating confusion’
At LB 89’s public hearing in February, State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who has filed motions to lead debate against the bill, repeatedly questioned Kauth how someone would know if someone was in the “right” bathroom if her bill passed. Hunt said that of some trans people who testified against Kauth’s bill, “I had no idea they were trans.” Hunt has also asked what would happen to intersex students.
“If I saw them in the bathroom, I wouldn’t think a thing — that’s a beautiful woman, that’s a handsome man,” Hunt told Kauth at the time. “What this is doing is creating confusion for those people because they do fear arrest. They do fear being kicked out of a space.”

State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, who sits on the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee with Hunt, said after the bill advanced 5-3 from committee: “That it took at least three different bites of the apple to define what a man and a woman are is a clear indication that this is a space that government should not be involved in.”
LB 89 provides an exception to the bathroom requirements for parents of children or caregivers of someone with a disability who is not the same sex as the adult.
Schools would need to designate bathrooms and locker rooms for use by females or males only, unless they are single occupancy. Family use bathrooms could also be designated.
A ‘softened’ opponent
Among the senators being eyed to get to 33 votes — the threshold needed to shut off debate after a set amount of time — is State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a Republican.
In the officially nonpartisan Legislature, Republicans maintain 33 seats while Democrats hold 15 seats. The remaining lawmaker is registered nonpartisan but votes with fellow progressives.
Since LB 89 was introduced in January, Riepe has described himself as a “doubting Thomas” on the bill and said that he was “leaning” against voting for it. But now, he said he is “leaning” toward voting for the bill for the first time. 
State Sen. Merv Riepe still the center of attention in Nebraska Legislature

He said he’s “softened” on the issue. He was previously not just a “no” but a “Hell no” on the bill, in part because of anger that the State Board of Education wasn’t taking up the issue. However, he said he wants to “protect women’s sports,” as other supporters have said is their goal.
Riepe said he can “only be the maverick in so many cases,” referring to his position as a critical vote on multiple bills the past few years, including those from Kauth.
Last week, Riepe said he would take the extended weekend to review LB 89, including the amendment to require doctors to verify a student’s sex before sports participation. When he first heard of that requirement, the longtime hospital administrator thought it could be “busy work.”
In 2024, Riepe was one of two Republicans who didn’t vote for a previous version of Kauth’s bill, at the time limited to K-12 sports, locker rooms and bathrooms. The bill fell two votes short. 
Getting around Riepe
There have also been efforts to get around Riepe’s vote, if needed, such as through Democratic State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, Jason Prokop of Lincoln or Dan Quick of Grand Island, multiple senators confirmed to the Nebraska Examiner.

Raybould said she, for example, was called into Pillen’s office earlier this month. After discussing the opening of a Super Saver in Pillen’s hometown of Columbus, a grocery chain that Raybould’s family operates, Pillen asked if Raybould could be counted on for Kauth’s bill.
In part of the exchange, Raybould said, she noted a distinction for transgender students and told Pillen she couldn’t vote for LB 89. She cited meetings with families and children who would be impacted, such as those from the nonprofit Rainbow Parents that formed over the past two years in response to Kauth’s legislation.
Raybould also brought LB 605 this year to enshrine regulations from the Nebraska School Activities Association for transgender sports participation into law. She later withdrew the bill.
Prokop, a more moderate freshman senator, said he will not vote for Kauth’s bill. His close ally in a similar swing vote position, State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, confirmed the same.
Quick declined to comment on the bill late last week.
A different federal landscape
Many of the components of Kauth’s LB 89 have already been addressed in a 2023 executive order from Pillen (for state agencies) and in 2025 executive orders from President Donald Trump (for school sports).

Trump and his education officials have threatened to pull federal funding from schools that allow student-athletes to participate according to gender identity, not sex. The Nebraska School Activities Association and National Collegiate Athletics Association each had narrow policies that were amended shortly after Trump’s executive orders.
Some opponents to Kauth’s legislation look to the impact of those state and national executive orders as making LB 89 obsolete. Riepe, for example, previously said that if Trump’s orders could last for the four years of his presidency, then LB 89 might be able to wait, too.
Kauth acknowledged LB 89 is coming under a very different federal administration than the past two years but that executive orders can be overturned. 
She said the state must protect its citizens.
“If we are not willing to govern ourselves, then someone else will do it for us,” Kauth said. “I would prefer to be the ones governing ourselves.”

Democrats are ending their bid to repeal a voter-approved limit on property tax growth, excising one of the most controversial revenue-raising ideas they’ve pursued this session.
The proposal, embedded in House Bill 2409, seeks to allow an increase in the growth factor from the current 1% cap to the combined rate of population growth plus inflation within a taxing district, not to exceed 3%. This would apply to the state’s common schools levy and for cities and counties, as well as special purpose districts.
A fiscal analysis projected that uncapping the state property tax would net an additional $200 million for public schools and potentially $236 million for local governments in the next budget. The bill passed the House Finance Committee on Saturday and is expected to be voted on by the House today.
But Rep. Steve Bergquist, D-Renton, the bill’s sponsor, filed an amendment Sunday to remove sections on the growth limit, effectively ending Democrats’ pursuit of the change.
“It’s my understanding we don’t have a three-corners agreement on those provisions,” Bergquist said Monday morning.
Three-corners refers to the Democratic leadership of the House, Senate and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson.
Without the property tax change, the bill will be focused on education funding and providing school districts with the ability to collect more revenue from voter-approved local levies.
From the outset of the session — now just six days from ending — Democrats’ desire to increase the limit has been fiercely opposed by Republican lawmakers and taxpayers who warned the measure would drive up living and housing costs.
A year ago, Senate Democrats pushed to erase the cap solely for cities and counties. It too ran into a buzzsaw of opposition, forcing the majority party to set it down.

Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.

The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”

‘Dots don’t quite connect’

Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.

Long-term trend

The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period. Alabama has 69,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than it did in 2000.

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

It’s been nearly two years since Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced a group of 16 individuals would each face several felonies carrying years of potential prison time for what she said was an undermining of the public’s faith in elections and a flagrant violation of the law.
According to investigators, after Trump lost Michigan to former President Joe Biden in 2020 by about 150,000 votes in the presidential race, 16 individuals from across the state met in the basement of the Michigan Republican Party’s Lansing headquarters on Dec. 14, 2020. There investigators say the group signed and submitted false documents contending they were the rightful slate of electors for Michigan. Those affidavits were then submitted to the United States Senate and National Archives.

The case has been lengthy, with a state judge hearing out the defense and prosecution of 15 defendants after the state dropped the case against one of the defendants.

24-1132_Documents 
Arguments from the defense have ranged from the group’s right to political protest to their actions being a lawful maneuver in the event that the 2020 election results be overturned.
The defense of multiple individuals in the group have taken particular issue with Nessel’s own comments surrounding the case, notably statements she made during a virtual event in September of 2023 where she said the group was “brainwashed” by Trump’s lies about the 2020 election being stolen from him.
“These are people who have been brainwashed,” Nessel said in the video. “They legit believe that … somebody can’t even plead guilty if they wanted to because they can’t admit that what they did violated the law because they still think they’re right.”
The defense team for one member of the group, Clifford Frost of Warren, argued that Nessel and her office are engaged in a “bad faith” case against the defendants, requesting at the end of 2023 that a federal judge intervene in the case. In January of 2024, U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker rejected the defense’s arguments, declining to intercede, saying a proper argument had not been made to support the “bad faith” contention.
Frost’s attorney, Kevin Kijewski, has argued that there was no criminal intent in what the state is alleging, adding that the defendants signed their own real names to the documents in an act of political protest.
However, on Thursday, a panel of judges in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Jonker’s decision to stay out of the state’s case. The appeal to the lower court’s decision was set before Judges Eric L. Clay, Judge Helene N. White and Judge John B. Nalbandian, a Trump appointee.
The opinion, penned by Clay, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, outlines that Frost’s defense does not call into question the state court’s competency to consider the challenges that have been made to the validity of the criminal charges he faces.
“…we must ‘assume that state procedures will afford an adequate remedy, in the absence of unambiguous authority to the contrary,’” the opinion reads. “In addition, Frost’s qualms with the adequacy of the State’s charging documents do not automatically convert his prosecution into a product of bad faith. This is particularly so where, as here, state court remains a viable forum for the consideration of Frost’s arguments.”
Preliminary exams for the group of defendants were held throughout 2024 by Ingham County District Court Judge Kristen Simmons, as the group was divided into three groups for three separate multi-day preliminary hearings, the last of which concluded in October 2024. 
Simmons now faces the task to review all the evidence and testimony the court received during the exams and evaluate if the case should proceed to trial. While a May 2 review hearing is set for the defendants, it’s not known when Simmons will hand down her decision.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-876701606-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 13:12:29.384495

(File photo by Sviatlana Lazarenka/Getty Images)South Carolina’s state-affiliated hospital system can now proceed with long-delayed expansion plans into some of the Palmetto State’s fastest-growing communities, but it will more than double its debt in the process.
After more than five years of court battles and four years of pandemic-induced financial hardships, the Medical University of South Carolina’s hospital system has final approvals in hand to finance two new hospitals in the suburbs of Charleston and Charlotte.
The State Fiscal Accountability Authority gave permission earlier this month for MUSC to borrow $860 million: $400 million to build a hospital and cancer center in Summerville’s mega Nexton community, $330 million to build a hospital in Indian Land (the unincorporated panhandle of Lancaster County), and $130 million to finance the equipment for both.
Unanimous approval from the state’s five-member fiscal oversight board came without discussion.
“These projects are good projects in and of themselves,” MUSC Health CEO Dr. Pat Cawley told the SC Daily Gazette. “We know both are in growing areas and we know those areas can easily support these facilities.”
The new borrowing adds to the public hospital system’s $836 million in existing long-term debt and leases, according to an April financial report.
By comparison, the similarly sized Prisma Health hospital system, headquartered in Greenville, carries a debt load of about $1.5 billion, according to the latest report from Wall Street ratings agencies.
Unlike the private Prisma Health, MUSC Health is a state-owned nonprofit.
But Cawley is not concerned by the financial lift, saying MUSC Health has more than enough borrowing capacity.
Expansive growth
MUSC Health first announced plans for the Summerville hospital in December 2017, citing the community’s booming population with mega developments such as the Nexton community filling up with thousands of new homes.
Hospital executives said patients were already making the drive from once-rural Berkeley County into downtown Charleston for health care. It was around this time the hospital system started talking about a new strategy to bring services closer to where patients live.
Two years later, MUSC purchased community hospitals in Chester and Lancaster counties and saw firsthand the growth potential in communities near the North Carolina state line.
Indian Land had the second-fastest-growing ZIP code in the state in early 2020, when that project was announced.
“That whole area where the population is booming is a bedroom community of Charlotte,” Cawley said in a statement accompanying the announcement. “We already have patients and employees who commute to our existing hospital in Lancaster to receive care or to work.”
“It’s been shown that to serve patients most effectively, you need to be where they are,” Cawley added. “Patients want to receive their health care closest to home and family. These days, we can build a small hospital and do it in a cost-efficient way so patients don’t have to travel.”
The announcement followed the system’s 2019 purchase of four rural community hospitals — in Florence and Marion, in addition to Lancaster and Chester.
That upended the health system’s nearly 200-year history of staying largely contained to its Charleston base.
In 2021, MUSC Health again expanded with the purchase of three hospitals and a standalone emergency room in the Midlands.
The public system took on debt for all of those purchases. Plus, it still owes upwards of $430 million for its 5-year-old children’s hospital and its Ashley River Tower hospital, which opened in 2008.
With all that, MUSC Health is still at less than half of its debt capacity, Cawley said.
While its tab is set to more than double, revenues generated by the two new hospitals when they open also will grow the system’s borrowing power, though Cawley did not say by how much.
Moody’s ratings agency praised MUSC for its “prudent fiscal management” when it held the combined university and hospital system steady at its highest-level credit rating. Analysts with the firm did note some concerns however, with the hospital’s significant debt leveraging and narrow margins.
Still, a lot has changed since MUSC Health’s December 2017 announcement about the Summerville location.
For starters, the hospital system suffered four years of operating losses that started with the onset of the global coronavirus pandemic.
“COVID created a major workforce disruption. That was a big issue for hospitals all across the country,” said Thornton Kirby, president of the South Carolina Hospital Association. “It also caused a significant financial crisis, because the labor costs went up so much when the reimbursement rates (paid to hospitals by insurance, Medicare and Medicaid) were not going up at the same rate.”
MUSC Health’s operations were back in the black as of last June, with the system’s 16 hospitals earning nearly $62 million in income after expenses for fiscal year 2023-24.
“We held back simply due to COVID-induced uncertainty,” Cawley said of the new hospital plans. “Since then, the need has grown, and we are ready to move forward again.”
Regulatory changes
In addition to the pandemic, the projects were also held up by legal challenges filed under the state’s soon-to-be phased out regulatory process that required providers to get a Certificate of Need.
The bureaucratic permission process was supposed to control costs and prevent duplication by providers in the same area. But critics argued the protections ended up reducing access to care and increasing costs as hospital systems fought in court to prevent competition and tied up proposals for years — as occurred with MUSC’s plans for Nexton and Indian Land.
Under a 2023 law phasing out the application approval process, new hospitals will no longer need a Certificate of Need starting in 2027.
While that will end lawsuits and hefty legal fees for hospital operators, it also opens them up to more competition for patients, particularly from hospital systems in border states.
“The truth of it is, hospitals make a lot of money in some areas and lose a lot of money in some areas,” Kirby said. “They make money on surgery and on imaging, and they lose money in the emergency room. They lose money taking care of pneumonia patients and they lose money delivering babies.”
That means hospitals rely on those money-making procedures to subsidize the other care provided.
“If you say anybody can build anything they want, they’re not going to build behavioral health units that lose money. They’re not going to build trauma services,” Kirby said. “They’re going to build surgery centers for insured people.”
Despite this, Kirby said hospital systems have not expressed a lot of angst about Certificate of Need going away.
“I hear people saying, ‘OK, this is the new environment. Let me decide what I’m going to do as a result,'” he said.
Unlike the SC Hospital Association, MUSC Health actually backed the law’s repeal, Cawley said.
He’s confident the hospital system will “remain successful and competitive in South Carolina.”
And there’s no end in site for the hospital system’s spending spree.
MUSC Health recently announced plans for a new cancer hospital in downtown Charleston.
“This is a monumental event for the entire state,” Charles Schulze, chairman of MUSC’s governing board, said in a statement. “The goal here is to have something that rivals the top cancer facilities in the nation so no one has to leave South Carolina for cancer care.”
That’s on top of the purchase of Roper St. Francis’ hospital on the peninsula announced last August.
MUSC Health has not named a dollar amount for either of these projects.
The price for the Roper building will be decided in 2029, when the hospital is scheduled to move to a new North Charleston location.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hospital-image-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 13:12:29.384495

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives Thursday passed a bill to make Juneteenth a state holiday.
HB 165, sponsored by Rep. Rick Rehm, R-Dothan, closes state offices on June 19, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. 
“This is a bill that is constituent driven, that was brought to me by my constituents,” Rehm said.

The legislation passed after years of efforts by Black Democrats in the Alabama Legislature, who either saw their proposals rejected or were effectively forced by Republicans to pair Juneteenth with Jefferson Davis’ Birthday, a state holiday honoring the slaveholder and white supremacist who said that Black Americans were “fitted expressly for human servitude.” 
The House last year approved a bill sponsored by Rep. Juanadalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, that would have required state employees to choose Juneteenth or Jefferson Davis’ Birthday as their day off, a choice not required of any other state holiday. 
Several Black Democrats said during the debate on the bill last year that they struggled with whether to support the legislation with the Davis requirement. The House approved the bill, but it did not come out of the Senate.  
Several Black Democrats in the House Thursday expressed their frustration that Rehm’s bill — which makes Juneteenth a standalone holiday not tied to Davis’ birthday — won approval from the majority Republican Legislature while Givan’s had to be altered before it could come to a vote. 
“There’s something wrong that the only way it could be a good bill is that somebody else carries it, and not the people that was affected by it in the first place,” Moore said.
Rep. Napoleon Bracy, D-Mobile, echoed Moore and said he was thankful the bill would pass but was upset that it took a white Republican like Rehm to pass it.
“Sometimes we need to win for our community,” Bracy said. “We’ve had people that have brought this legislation for decades, and it wasn’t good enough.”
The bill passed 85-4 with a floor amendment by Rep. Laura Hall, D-Huntsville, that moved the effective date up to June 1 so that state employees could reap the benefits of the legislation this year. 
“It was going to be taking effect on October 1, and we wanted it to take effect prior to the actual holiday,” Rehm said, supporting the amendment.
Gov. Kay Ivey has signed memos for the last four years making Juneteenth a federal holiday. Juneteenth has also been a federally recognized holiday since 2021.
Alabama’s official state holiday calendar puts Robert E. Lee’s Birthday on the same day as Martin Luther King’s Birthday. The state also marks Confederate Memorial Day on the fourth Monday in April. 
The bill goes to the Senate.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Two Indiana statewide elected officials filed a lawsuit Friday against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, months after they first urged the federal agency to verify the citizenship of more than 585,000 registered Hoosier voters. 
In October, Secretary of State Diego Morales and Attorney General Todd Rokita petitioned the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) — which is housed within the homeland security agency — to review lists of voters who registered without providing a state-issued form of identification.
Federal officials “have failed to provide information that would enable Indiana to verify that only eligible voters participated in elections,” Morales’ and Rokita’s offices alleged in news releases Monday.
Story continues below.
2025.4.16 – Complaint
 
There is no evidence of widespread noncitizen voter fraud. It is illegal under both state and federal law to cast a ballot as a noncitizen.
“Following the Biden administration’s obstruction here, I expect that President (Donald) Trump’s team will resolve this matter,” Rokita said in the release. “This lawsuit is another important step in ensuring the integrity of our elections. Hoosiers have a right to know that legitimate ballots are not being diluted by noncitizens. I promised that I would get citizenship information from USCIS, and that is exactly what I am doing by filing this suit.”  
Though Trump took office in January, his administration has also declined to respond to Indiana’s request. Over a dozen other states have filed similar missives. 
The 585,774 Hoosiers from the Oct. 11 letter include those who registered without an Indiana driver’s license number or a social security number — or who live overseas. Some of those could include Hoosiers who registered before those numbers were required. 
It represents roughly 12% of the registered voters for the November election. 
But critics pushed back, saying that the USCIS Person Centric Query Service wasn’t designed to process large numbers of voters and could be prone to error. 
In a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Common Cause Indiana Executive Director Julia Vaughn said Hoosiers deserve better. 
Indiana officials ask federal government to verify citizenship of 585K registered voters

“It is shameful that the Attorney General and Secretary of State continue to put partisan games at the forefront of their job responsibilities. Indiana elections are, and always have been, safe and secure. This is just another attempt to spread misinformation about voting and at the same time, intimidate naturalized citizens from exercising their rights. Hoosiers deserve better than this waste of taxpayer dollars wrapped up in an unnecessary lawsuit,” Vaughn said.
The Department of Homeland Security does offer access to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, which requires an identifier such as a registration number, which makes it “not suited” for verification, according to the lawsuit. 
In October, Morales told the Capital Chronicle that the verification push stemmed from county-level officials concerned about an uptick in absentee ballot requests for overseas voters — Hoosiers living abroad, including those in the military, vote using absentee ballots.
“As Indiana’s Chief Election Officer, ensuring the integrity of our elections is non-negotiable,” Morales said in the Monday release. “This legal action is a continuation of our efforts for Indiana to lead the way in election integrity. Since we never received a response from the Biden administration, we know that under President Trump’s leadership and based on his recent Executive Order, there’s a stronger commitment to the election process. Hoosiers deserve nothing less than full confidence in the security of their vote.”
It’s unclear what executive order Morales referenced, though a breakdown of election-oriented proclamations by the Brennan Center for Justice includes an overhaul that the left-leaning group said was illegal. 
In particular, Trump’s actions align with the Congressional SAVE Act, which some have worried would disenfranchise married women who changed their last names but might not have matching documentation. Under SAVE, individuals must present a passport, birth certificate or other citizenship documentation when registering.

More than two-thirds know someone impacted by SUD, and the data shows robust support – across political and demographic lines – for a health-first approach to the issue. North Carolinians support expanding access to the full spectrum of evidence-based SUD treatment, including medications and eliminating SUD-based discrimination.
Leaders in North Carolina’s executive and legislative branches can take heart in this emerging consensus of support for their efforts to combat the state’s overdose epidemic. Fortunately, Governor Josh Stein and First Lady Anna Stein both support access to evidence-based treatment and ending the stigma that interferes with the delivery of treatment. 
Additionally, State Representative Timothy Reeder and State Senator Jim Burgin recently held a press conference with the Addiction Professionals of NC (APNC) to announce the NC Treatment Connection website, aimed at ensuring all SUD treatment providers in the state use evidence-based models.
These efforts are essential since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ranks North Carolina in the top 15 states with the highest fatal overdose rates. According to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, 2023 (the most current year of data) marks NC’s highest rate of fatal overdose since 2010, with an estimated 4,442 deaths. That’s 12 deaths per day, more than double the rate of fatalities from vehicle crashes  that year.
For opioid use disorder, the most evidence-based form of treatment uses either methadone or buprenorphine, two of the three medications approved by the FDA for treatment of this disorder. The third, naltrexone, has much less robust evidence of efficacy.
Buprenorphine and methadone are effective at treating opioid withdrawal and cravings for opioids. These two medications for opioid disorder (MOUD), in repeated studies, show a reduction in overdose death rates of at least two-fold. 
If a medication showed such a reduction in death when used to treat any other chronic condition, failing to provide that medication would be malpractice. Yet MOUD is often prohibited in settings such as drug courts, skilled nursing facilities, and even in residential SUD treatment programs. These stigmatizing practices lead to unnecessary deaths.
We must eliminate MOUD- and SUD- based discrimination in all settings, especially healthcare settings. The stigma some medical professionals hold towards people with SUD can lead to dangerous results. Studies have shown clinicians can miss important diagnoses or deny care when they harbor preconceived ideas about patients. 
Inadequate treatment of withdrawal symptoms causes patients to leave against medical advice or avoid medical care completely. Verbal and nonverbal communication of disdain or judgment from medical providers intensifies the shame already felt by patients with SUD and harms the therapeutic relationship. Even at facilities treating SUD, some providers carry negative attitudes towards life-saving buprenorphine and methadone.
The people of North Carolina also have reasons for optimism. In 2024, North Carolina experienced a five-year low of 12,447 emergency department visits due to overdose. The availability of naloxone, now free at many jails, health departments, and harm reduction sites, and the use of mobile OUD treatment clinics to reach people in areas that previously lacked access has contributed to this positive trend.
Clearly, there’s much more work to be done. North Carolina’s widespread support for strategies that prioritize treatment over punishment signals a prime opportunity for action. NC leaders should build on their efforts in three key ways:

Ensure emergency departments, primary care providers, jails, recovery courts, and SUD treatment programs all provide – or act as conduits to – evidence-based treatment.
Expand the SUD treatment workforce
Ensure public funds, including opioid settlement money, only support programs that provide access to evidence-based treatment.

Overwhelming public support for a health-first approach, the leadership of policymakers committed to change, and the availability of lifesaving interventions bring the overdose crisis within our reach for positive change.
By investing in treatment, harm reduction, and policies that promote recovery and combat discrimination, North Carolina can save lives and create a robust healthcare system that treats all people with dignity and respect. There is consensus, and the path forward is clear.

(FatCamera/Getty Images)On the week that North Carolina senators were busy rolling out a $32.6B spending plan, it was difficult to gain attention for legislation that some consider a longshot this session. But Senator Natalie Murdock (D-Chatham, Durham) refused to allow budget week to shift her focus from what she sees as the critical need to pass a bill crafted to improve Black maternal health outcomes.
The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world. And Black women in the U.S. are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related health problems than white women.
  Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
Murdock has repeated those sobering facts for more than three years now, as she tries to get the Republican-controlled Senate to advance the MOMnibus 3.0 Act.
Battling perceptions and negative stereotypes
Gabriel Scott, an MPA with the North Carolina Coalition of the National Council of Negro Women, joined Murdock last week in advocating for Senate Bill 571/House Bill 725.
Scott said when she went into labor at 25 weeks, doctors were dismissive.
“I needed pain medication, I needed help, I needed something. They did not listen.”
After she delivered her twins, complications with the placenta and an excessive loss of blood, left her husband terrified she might need a blood transfusion.
“They finally had an anesthesiologist come to give me medication. My husband said, can you at least tell me what the medication is? And the anesthesiologist laughed and said, ‘Oh, this is typically medicine we give to war vets who have had limbs blown off,’” Scott recounted. “They took it as a joke. The doctor continued to shove his arm in me.”
Hours later in recovery, a white female doctor came to her room acknowledging the difficulty of the delivery.
“And she said, there are things that we know we do well at the hospital and then there are things that we know we don’t do well, and one of those things is our treatment of African-American women and childbirth.”
The same doctor suggested both she and her husband might seek mental health help.
Scott gives thanks to God that her twin girls are healthy. But she’s been dealing with pelvic pain for over four years and the trauma of doctors who didn’t listen to her.
  Dr. Charity Watkins (Photo: Duke.edu)
Dr. Charity Watkins, an assistant professor of social work at North Carolina Central University and a maternal health researcher at Duke University, shared her own terrifying story of pregnancy-related heart failure.
“I always feel it is important for me to introduce myself using my professional roles. Maybe my doctoral degree will save me from the daily mistreatment I experienced because of my dark complexion. Maybe leaning into the perceived prestige of being a professor will protect me from poor perceptions and negative stereotypes associated with being a Black woman,” Watkins told a room of reporters on Wednesday.
After her pregnancy, Watkins presented with classic heart failure symptoms, a family history of heart disease, and a recent cesarean delivery followed by hemorrhaging.
She was told by a doctor that maybe it was the flu.
“What could have led to me receiving quality health care without having to prove I’m worthy of being treated as a human being?”
MOMnibus 3.0
Watkins believes the MOMnibus 3.0 Act would have changed her birth story, with doctors who would not have dismissed her as being over-dramatic or “just another Black woman exaggerating her pain levels.”
The legislation would direct the NC Department of Health and Human Services to establish and operate a maternal mortality prevention grant initiative that would establish or expand programs for the prevention of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among Black women.
  Rep. Zack Hawkins (D-Durham) (Photo: ncleg.gov)
“It’s time for us to provide Black mothers with more confidence in their care before, during, and after childbirth,” said Watkins.
The legislation would also require NCDHHS, in collaboration with community-based organizations led by Black women and a historically Black college and universities (HBCUs) that primarily serves minority populations to create evidence-based implicit bias training program for health care professionals.
Patients receiving care at a perinatal care facility would also receive a list of their rights including being informed of continuing health care requirements following discharge.
The bill would also earmark $3 million for each year of the 2025-27 biennium for the UNC Board of Governors for recruiting, training, and retaining a diverse workforce of lactation consultants in North Carolina.
Reps. Zack Hawkins (D-Durham) and Julie von Haefen (D-Wake) are advocating for HB 725, the companion bill in the state House.
Hawkins said his two sisters and his wife had their own stories in which doctors were not “listening appropriately” to their pain, and the fact that they knew their own bodies.
Von Haefen said while it may not seem like her place to speak on Black health, she also knew she could not turn away.
“This should not be something that’s put solely on Black women. White women need to be allies in this fight, because we are all mothers.”
In North Carolina Black women are 1.8 times more likely to die from childbirth, two-thirds of these deaths are preventable, according to Murdock.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/black-maternal-health2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 12:24:47.407380

Joy Jochim of Mandan displayed a sign calling for the protection of transgender rights. She said she is against many of the initiatives President Donald Trump’s administration is carrying out in its first months of work, such as cuts to the Social Security Administration and proposed cuts to Medicaid.
“I’m glad people are coming out and protesting,” Jochim said. 
Sharon Korsmo of Bismarck said a person’s “day in court” is fundamental and expressed concerns about the Trump administration’s deportations of hundreds of people to an El Salvador prison without the chance to challenge their cases in court. 
“How do we know who he’s going to turn on next?” Korsmo said.
Kori Holub, an occupational therapist in Dickinson, said she’s already noticing the children with disabilities she treats on the Medicaid program are unable to get “medical necessity” services at their homes based on her recommendations.
She said those kids won’t have access at home to equipment such as a disability swing or support vests.
Holub also volunteers with the National Disabled Veterans Winter Sports Clinic, which helps veterans with traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and other injuries participate in adaptive sports. 
During the clinic over the winter, Holub said some Department of Veterans Affairs employees received notices for layoffs, which worried her because those federal workers are a large part of the program.
“I don’t expect this (the winter sports clinic) to happen this year,” she said. “We’ll see.”

During a press conference Monday, Driskell highlighted Florida Highway Patrol’s arrest of Lopez-Gomez on Wednesday, when he was a passenger in a car during a traffic stop on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee. The 20-year-old, born in Georgia, was charged under a temporarily suspended law making it a first-degree misdemeanor to illegally enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
  House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell (via Florida House of Representatives)
The case garnered national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reporting on Thursday. Lopez-Gomez was released from jail Thursday evening, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is in custody of the driver of the car, who doesn’t enjoy legal permanent status, in a Broward County transitional center.
“We are a nation of laws, and no one — not Ron DeSantis, not Donald Trump — no one gets to decide to imprison people without cause,” Driskell said. “We need better answers about this. Ron DeSantis and his administration need to answer for this unlawful arrest, and for the pain and suffering they caused, and the fear that they continue to stoke throughout our communities.”
Attorney general tells law enforcement to stand down
Although Attorney General James Uthmeier argues that the federal prohibition on enforcement of the law, SB 4C, doesn’t apply to law enforcement, he sent a memo Friday to FHP, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, police chiefs, and sheriffs stating that they shouldn’t arrest or detain anyone under the suspended law.
“I should also note that while my office represents the current defendants named in this case, it does not represent nonparties like your law enforcement agencies,” Uthmeier wrote in the memo.
The new attorney general, who used to be Gov. DeSantis’ chief of staff, said the state would continue this argument in the federal court for the Southern District of Florida or an appellate court.
His memo came at the direction of U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams on Friday, when she extended the bar on enforcement until the next hearing on April 29.
The judge had barred enforcement of the law on April 4, a little over a month after DeSantis signed it, and she expressed frustration during the Friday hearing in Miami about Lopez-Gomez’s arrest.
Immigrant advocacy groups, Florida Immigrant Coalition and Farmworker Association of Florida Inc., and two women without permanent legal status are suing Uthmeier, the statewide prosecutor, and state attorneys over the constitutionality of the law.
“We appreciate that the federal courts have seen through this blatantly unconstitutional law, but the reality is that, without enforcement, it seems that local law enforcement and Florida Highway Patrol are continuing to ignore the judge and order,” said Miriam Fahsi Haskell, an attorney for Community Justice Project representing the plaintiffs, in a phone interview with the Phoenix Friday. “The reality is that once a person is arrested under SB 4C and booked into jail, that person risks then having an ICE hold on them.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-21 15:26:33+00:00,CT Mirror,Lawmakers to offer CT budget that pushes back on ‘fiscal guardrails’,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/21/ct-budget-fiscal-guardrails-pushback/,"State legislators will propose their budget Tuesday, using every loophole and maneuver available to bend budget caps without breaking them.","Though potentially massive cuts in federal aid loom, Connecticut’s General Assembly can’t tackle that crisis until it first solves another.
State budget caps that amassed huge surpluses since 2017 have taken a heavy toll, leaving big challenges for funding education, health care and social services. 
The legislature’s Appropriations Committee will begin trying to plug those gaps Tuesday when it proposes a spending plan for the next two fiscal years. That blueprint will set the stage for final budget negotiations with Gov. Ned Lamont later this spring or summer as the picture from Washington becomes clearer.
In the meantime, state legislators will use every loophole and maneuver available to bend these budget caps — or “fiscal guardrails” — without breaking them.

The committee will assume raises for most state employees, due this July 1, won’t be negotiated on time.


Legislators will propose reforming one “guardrail” immediately — moving about $300 million earmarked to reduce pension debt back into the General Fund this fiscal year.


As Lamont did, the panel will endorse creating a big, new off-budget account to expand child care services while circumventing a spending cap that keeps budget growth in line with household income and inflation.


It also will follow Lamont’s lead and under-fund guaranteed health benefits for retired state employees by almost $230 million.

Even with these maneuvers, the committee’s spending plan will postpone — yet again — a major increase in Medicaid rates for physicians who treat the poor. The last broad-based rate adjustment plan took effect in early 2008, and critics say many children and adults enrolled in Connecticut’s HUSKY program effectively are uninsured, unable to find doctors willing to accept more Medicaid patients.
But the committee plan will maintain enhanced funding for special education while reversing planned cuts to basic grants for about 80 K-12 school districts.
“We need to stop looking at the storm down in Washington and look at the storm that’s here in Connecticut,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee. 
“There are a lot of things that need to be addressed,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, the panel’s other co-chair, who added the panel tried to stabilize those programs most at risk before expected federal cuts blast big new holes in numerous state programs.
“I’m not a hair-on-fire kind of person. I’m not exaggerating anything,” she added. “But the things that are being cut at the federal level are going to have a big impact on the people.”
With Congress aiming to slash federal spending by $880 billion per year, state officials project losses in Medicaid funds alone could range from almost $200 million to about $1 billion. And that doesn’t include anticipated losses in special education, public health and addiction services, and federal aid to Connecticut municipalities.
But state programs already have been forfeiting big dollars for nearly a decade.
‘Fiscal guardrails’ have taken a toll
Connecticut has closed the past seven fiscal years with an average of $1.8 billion left over — a whopping total equal to roughly 8% of the General Fund and far more than legislators from both parties envisioned in 2017 when they enacted a broad array of budget caps.
Lamont’s administration projects Connecticut will close the current fiscal year — its eighth under the so-called “fiscal guardrails” system — with a similar, $1.8 billion cushion.
Those windfalls don’t mean state government can spare all those funds.
Critics say the “guardrails” system falsely characterizes hundreds of millions of dollars in annual income and business tax receipts as too “volatile” — meaning they fluctuate too much from year to year and shouldn’t be spent on ongoing problems. Instead, these revenues, which have been used to build reserves and whittle down pension debt, have grown steadily.
The leaching of resources from education, health care and social services has been mitigated somewhat by the nearly $3 billion Congress gave Connecticut in 2021 to repair damage caused by COVID. Lamont and the General Assembly have been doling out chunks of these pandemic grants, including more than $500 million this fiscal year, to these core programs. 
But nearly all that relief has been exhausted. 
While Democrats in the legislature’s majority have been vocal critics of the caps, they aren’t the only ones who’ve struggled to follow them.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat who praised the caps repeatedly, conceded in February that the program for saving “volatile” revenues should be scaled back. He proposed moving about $300 million annually, starting next year, from the save category into safe-to-spend.
While Republicans insist the “guardrails” be left untouched, their votes haven’t matched their statements.
The GOP voted overwhelmingly with Democrats in late February to order an extra $40 million in aid to local K-12 districts to mitigate a crisis in special education — despite warnings from Lamont that expenditures already were on pace to exceed the spending cap.
Panel finds more for K-12 education, social services, child care
The Appropriations Committee wants to continue that extra $40 million in special education grants in each of the next two fiscal years. Lamont’s budget included the extra funding, but not until 2026-27. 
That’s because the governor’s biennial plan, which appropriates $27 billion across all programs in the first year, falls a razor-thin $1.8 million under the spending cap. The $28.2 billion proposed for 2026-27 falls a more comfortable $261 million under the limit.
The committee’s plan will recommend more spending than Lamont did in some other areas:

Education Cost Sharing [ECS] grants, the main state funding program for K-12 district expenses, would gain another $8.7 million in the first year and $17 million in the second so that no community would receive a cut in funding. The existing ECS formula calls for about 80 communities to receive less in the next budget cycle.


The private, nonprofit community agencies that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored social services for people with developmental disabilities would gain $19 million to replace expiring pandemic grant dollars Lamont and lawmakers gave them last spring.

The committee would follow Lamont’s lead and create a new $300 million account, outside of the formal budget and spending cap, to allow investments in child care services for years to come.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee said only that the administration “will review the General Assembly’s budget proposal when it is officially released and then work with legislative leaders on an honestly balanced budget that complies with all legal requirements.”
Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican, predicted GOP lawmakers would fight the committee proposal, which she said places too much emphasis on working around budget caps and not enough on finding ways to trim state spending.
“They’re putting in a budget that’s expanding the size of government” at the wrong time, she said.
Struggling to find dollars for Medicaid rates, retiree health care
The committee plan will not fix two other problems legislators are facing — at least not right away.
The first involves financing a major upgrade in Medicaid rates paid to doctors and other providers. A 2019 analysis by KFF, the health care think-tank formerly known as Kaiser Family Foundation, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid rates for most specialists ranked 42nd among all states, just ahead of West Virginia.
Earlier this year, Democratic legislators announced a plan to boost spending on Medicaid rates by $300 million by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year.
Instead, the Appropriations Committee spending plan hew closely to the increased spending Lamont proposed in February: adding about $10 million next fiscal year and $25 million in 2026-27 for a much more modest, incremental bump.
The second major problem involves funding for retiree health care.
Comptroller Sean Scanlon recommended that the committee find another $228 million over the next budget cycle — in addition to what Lamont proposed — to cover this contractual obligation. The comptroller made a similar recommendation to the Lamont administration in December, but the governor didn’t add the money into his February budget plan.
Scanlon said he is very hopeful those cost hikes can be reduced somewhat in the coming months. The comptroller is soliciting bids for a new Medicare Advantage provider, directing patients to lower-cost care sites and providers and negotiating savings on prescription drugs.
Like Lamont did, the committee also will wait to see how much savings the comptroller can secure before scrambling to find more dollars for this retirement benefit.
Thousands of state employees may be waiting a while for a raise
The committee plan also has no room under the spending cap to pay raises to most state workers next fiscal year, even though their contracts expire June 30.
Connecticut did reach a tentative deal recently with a small unit representing part-time teachers at online Charter Oak State College. And a raise agreement is expected soon with the state police troopers.
But Lamont has announced no wage agreement with the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which represents every major union excluding the troopers.
SEBAC unions have received about 4.5% annual raises — a 2.5% general hike and a step increase that normally is worth another 2 percentage points — for the past four fiscal years. According to nonpartisan analysts, this year’s raises cost the General Fund about $120 million.
Anticipating similar raises going forward, Lamont in February proposed adding $129 million to the reserve for salary adjustments in the 2025-26 fiscal year, and $242 million extra in 2026-27.
But if the governor and SEBAC don’t deliver a tentative deal to lawmakers before the regular session ends June 4, then the prospects of raises being approved on time are slim. 
That doesn’t mean workers would forfeit raises. A pay hike eventually ordered for 2025-26 might be delivered late — as has been done on occasion in the past.
In other words, legislators could budget nothing for raises in 2025-26, carving out $129 million in spending cap room in the fiscal year they need it most, and deliver retroactive raises in 2026-27, when the cap doesn’t fit so snugly. It just requires Lamont and the unions to take their time reaching a deal.
“Everybody has indicated to me it will not happen this year,” Osten said. 
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, declined to comment on the timing of contract negotiations, as did Drew Stoner, spokesman for the coalition of unions.
Stoner added, though, that “what remains clear is the vital role our public services — and the 45,000 state workers who keep Connecticut running. With agencies across the state understaffed and federal uncertainty growing, we must do everything we can to recruit and retain the workforce needed to meet this moment. The public deserves nothing less.”
Speeding up reform of budget ‘guardrails’
Recognizing their plan has some holes, Appropriations Committee members also will try to carve out some extra dollars that could be tapped later.
While Lamont proposed scaling back one mandatory savings program by $300 million starting next fiscal year, the committee will propose that change happen right away. That would allow legislators, if necessary, to take $300 million of this fiscal year’s surplus, transfer those dollars to either of the next two fiscal years, and spend them on core programs at that time.
“I think the most important thing Connecticut can do is adopt a budget on time, fund the core things we wanted to fund, … and give people predictability,” said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who said top legislative leaders also are backing the committee’s proposal to begin “guardrails” reform right away.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DSC05379.jpg,,,2025-04-21 12:24:47.407380

Experts worry that Medicaid’s complexity can make it hard for people to see how potential cuts to the program’s funding could impact not just insurance coverage, but also could result in longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures (Brandon Bell/Getty Images).Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”

Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.
“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
 Public debate

Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.
From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.
In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
 Making the connection

Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

California is making progress in curbing fentanyl-related deaths, but opioid overdoses continue to kill thousands of people every year.


Any Californian can purchase naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal medication, directly from the state at a discounted price, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announced Monday. 
The medication is available online for $24 for a two-pack of the nasal spray, roughly half the market price of the drug. Previously, the discount was available only to government organizations and businesses. 
“Life-saving medications shouldn’t come with a life-altering price tag. CalRx is about making essential drugs like naloxone affordable and accessible for all — not the privileged few,” Newsom said in a statement. CalRx is a Newsom initiative to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. 
California has spent more than $1 billion fighting the opioid epidemic, which killed more than 8,900 people last year, according to preliminary data from the state health department. That represents a 13% increase in deaths from 2023. 
The Naloxone Distribution Project and Access Initiative is part of the strategy to stop overdoses, which began spiking in 2019 as fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid, infused the market. The rate of fentanyl-related overdose deaths began declining last year, according to state data.
More than 6 million naloxone kits have been distributed to local governments and organizations since 2018, according to state data. About 355,000 overdoses have been reversed.
In 2024, Newsom’s office announced a new supplier for the state initiative, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, which agreed to sell the steeply discounted drug to California. Days prior, Attorney General Rob Bonta announced a $273-million multistate settlement with the New Jersey-based company over its alleged failure to report suspicious opioid orders that contributed to the country’s epidemic.
“By getting this lower price, we are making the financial savings and able to use our dollars to buy more product, which of course is ultimately very much about saving lives,” said Elizabeth Landsberg, director of the Department of Health Care Access and Information, last year. 
Naloxone is one of two current efforts by the state to make generic drugs more affordable under Newsom’s effort to lower the costs of pharmaceuticals. California has a $50-million contract to manufacture generic insulins for CalRx. That project is more than a year behind schedule.

The disparate events ranged from a march through midtown Manhattan and a rally in front of the White House to a demonstration at a Massachusetts commemoration of “the shot heard ’round the world” on April 19, 1775, marking the start of the Revolutionary War 250 years ago.
Thomas Bassford was among the demonstrators at the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord outside Boston. The 80-year-old retired mason from Maine said he believes Americans are under attack from their own government and need to stand up against it.
“This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,” said Bassford, who was with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. “I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom.”
In Denver, hundreds of protesters gathered at the Colorado State Capitol with banners expressing solidarity with immigrants and telling the Trump administration: “Hands Off!” People waved U.S. flags, some of them held upside down to signal distress.
Thousands of people also marched through downtown Portland, Oregon, while in San Francisco, hundreds spelled out the words “Impeach & Remove” on a sandy beach along the Pacific Ocean, also with an inverted U.S. flag. People walked through downtown Anchorage, Alaska, with handmade signs listing reasons why they were demonstrating, including one that one that read: “No sign is BIG enough to list ALL of the reasons I’m here!”
Elsewhere protests were planned outside Tesla car dealerships against billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk and his role in downsizing the federal government. Others organized more community service-oriented events such as food drives, teach-ins and volunteering at local shelters.
The protests come just two weeks after similar nationwide demonstrations.
Organizers say they oppose what they call Trump’s civil rights violations and constitutional violations, including efforts to deport scores of immigrants and to scale back the federal government by firing thousands of government workers and effectively shuttering entire agencies.
Some of the events drew on the spirit of the Revolutionary War, calling for “no kings” and resistance to tyranny.
In Anchorage, a colonial reenactor in colonial garb held up a “No Kings” sign while the person next to him hoisted cardboard that read in part: “The Feudal Age is OVER.”
Boston resident George Bryant, who was among those at the Concord protest, said he is concerned that the president is creating a “police state.” He held a sign saying, “Trump fascist regime must go now!”
“He’s defying the courts. He’s kidnapping students. He’s eviscerating the checks and balances,” Bryant said. “This is fascism.”
In Washington, Bob Fasick, a 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia, said he came out to the rally near the White House out of concern over threats to constitutionally protected due process rights, Social Security and other federal safety-net programs.
The Trump administration, among other things, has moved to shutter Social Security Administration field offices, cut funding for government health programs and scale back protections for transgender people.
“I cannot sit still knowing that if I don’t do anything and everybody doesn’t do something to change this, that the world that we collectively are leaving for the little children, for our neighbors is simply not one that I would want to live,” Fasick said.
In Columbia, South Carolina, several hundred people protested at the statehouse holding signs with slogans such as “Fight Fiercely, Harvard, Fight.”
And in Manhattan, protesters rallied against continued deportations of immigrants as they marched from the New York Public Library north toward Central Park and past Trump Tower.
“No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,” they chanted to a steady drumbeat, referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Marshall Green said he is most concerned that Trump invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 by claiming the country is at war with Venezuelan gangs linked to the South American nation’s government, even though a recent U.S. intelligence assessment found no coordination between them.
“Congress should be stepping up and saying no, we are not at war. You cannot use that,” said the 61-year-old from Morristown, New Jersey. “You cannot deport people without due process, and everyone in this country has the right to due process no matter what.”
Meanwhile Melinda Charles, of Connecticut, said she worries about “executive overreach,” citing clashes with the federal courts, Harvard University and other elite colleges.
“We’re supposed to have three equal branches of government,” she said, “and to have the executive branch become so strong, I mean it’s just unbelievable.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Maine voters send our elected officials to Washington to solve problems — not make them worse. But Congress is moving forward with budget plans that would harm the health, stability, and well-being of Maine’s families, aging residents, and immigrant communities. Fortunately, Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and our representatives have the opportunity to reject these dangerous proposals and fund real solutions.
The proposals being advanced by Congress would slash funding for healthcare and food assistance that Mainers rely on and funnel billions into expanding the Trump administration’s capacity to separate families and put immigrants in detention — severely compromising our communities’ health, safety, and stability.
As the oldest state in the country, Maine communities rely on Medicaid and a strong healthcare system to stay healthy. More than 350,700 Mainers rely on Medicaid, which faces billions in budget cuts under these proposals. These cuts could cause devastating damage to our healthcare economy. Community health centers — serving 204,000 patients at 174 clinics across the state — would likely have to close their doors, costing over 2,200 jobs.
Our families also depend on food assistance, but the current budget proposals threaten to take it away. On top of the USDA cuts that pull food from the shelves of distributors like Good Shepherd Food Bank, Congress’s proposals would sharply cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding, which feeds over 172,200 — or one in eight — Maine residents. 
While these budget plans make devastating cuts to programs that Maine’s young and old depend on, they authorize Congress to allocate billions to separate families and uproot workers who call Maine home.  
Immigrants are integral members of our state’s communities, but Congress’s budget proposals include up to $350 billion — potentially up to a half-trillion — to drastically expand the Trump administration’s ability to detain and deport our immigrant neighbors. The administration’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency recently put out a request for proposal for new detention centers — potential contracts totaling up to $45 billion. The funding to pay for them would come directly from taxpayers. 
The devastation from this inhumane investment would be felt most acutely by our families and economy. Over 20,500 children in Maine have at least one immigrant parent. As of 2023, nearly 53,450 immigrants live in Maine — and though they make up only 3.8% of the state’s population, immigrant workers account for nearly 5% of the state’s labor force, filling critical gaps as older generations retire. In 2023 alone, Maine’s immigrant residents paid $625.8 million in taxes, contributing to the Medicare, Social Security, and other programs that Mainers depend on.
Instead of taking taxpayers’ dollars away from healthcare and nutrition to fund family separation and tax breaks for the wealthy, Congress must invest in solutions that enhance the health, stability, and family unity of all Mainers. They should invest in less costly, more supportive services like legal representation that uphold the right to due process and help people navigate the immigration system without taking them away from their families, communities, and jobs. And they should maintain and support our nation’s longstanding investment in healthcare and food assistance.
The stakes for our communities couldn’t be higher, and the budget decisions made by Congress this spring will have long-lasting consequences. As Maine’s members of Congress move forward with their debates on budget reconciliation, we urge them to remember this: the health and stability of our communities is in your hands; we send you to Washington to solve problems and deliver solutions that give every Mainer a fair shot at building a safe, healthy, and meaningful life.

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas State Department of Education commissioner Randy Watson has an unobstructed view of financial, political and social battles about how best to educate nearly 500,000 school children in Kansas.
In addition to regular collaboration with members of the Kansas State Board of Education, he routinely visits classrooms to absorb perspectives on everything from the basics of reading and math to human sexuality, special education, summer school and the training of current and future teachers. He wades into issues of access to computer technology and cellphones in schools. He’s there for debates on appropriation of state and federal tax dollars to public education, as well as how that funding was deployed in more than 280 local school districts across Kansas.
“What makes me want to get up in the morning is trying to help young people and the people that serve those young people do their job well. There’s rarely a week that I’m not in schools,” Watson said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “I not a politician, but I deal in a political environment all the time. At the end of the day, again, what gets me up is: How can we help people that educate kids have a great environment to do so?”


The state Board of Education has a constitutional responsibility for public education in Kansas and the duty to hire a state education commissioner to assist with crafting policy, rules and regulations aimed at fulfilling the promise of education in preschool to high school classrooms.
Watson, a former teacher and superintendent, recently recommended the state Board of Education and local school boards consider working together on a special summer school program to help the students in pre-kindergarten, kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 gain some academic ground in the subjects of reading and math. The COVID-19 pandemic set children back at all levels, he said, but recovery has been influenced by separate decisions to reduce the number of school days while maintaining the required total of annual hours of instruction.
“A lot of research says if you’re not at that grade level by the time you hit third grade, it’s really hard to catch up, and most do not,” he said. “In fact, more fall further behind.”
He said a summer program would be voluntary for students and could involve 90 minutes of instruction daily. Students could come together for four-day weeks and gain about 50 hours of instruction time, he said.
“If that was with one of our many great teachers in Kansas, what could we do? We could stop the summer slide for sure,” he said.
 
Public and private
Of course, the Kansas Legislature and the state’s governor have large roles in terms of funding and policy of public education. That involves politics and, at times, controversy.
Members of the 2025 Legislature attempted, but failed, to gain traction with a bill providing as much as $125 million in annual state funding in the form of state income tax breaks to families of students in private schools. Similar proposals to ease the financial burden of enrolling 26,000 students to accredited and unaccredited private schools have surfaced in Kansas, but those also met the fate of Senate Bill 75. The bill introduced by Republican Sen. Renee Erickson, a former middle school principal in Wichita, didn’t advance in the House or Senate.
“Some states have gone full force into that,” Watson said. “Other states have pulled back. Some states have put that up to a vote. I can tell you currently where the state board is on that. They believe that public funds should go to public education.”
Watson, too, observed as the Legislature placed in state law, despite Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto, contents of a bill that dealt on two objectives. Part of the bill granted the state Board of Education authority to set compensation of elected board members, while the balance mandated public schools that teach anything about human development to also present students with a computer-generated animation or high-definition ultrasound video of fetal development. The law says the presentation must last at least 3 minutes.
A battle between Kansans for Life and Planned Parenthood illustrated the core of the bill was about influencing opinions of school children on abortion rights, which were affirmed by the Kansas Supreme Court and by Kansas voters. Statehouse debate on the fetal development curriculum bill touched on the state Board of Education’s constitutional role in establishing educational standards and the responsibility of local school boards to determine precise curriculum.
“The state board was opposed to that bill. It had nothing to do with the content,” Watson said. “What is shown in a video is a local board decision, and the state board said, while we may or may not like the contents, that is a local decision, and we don’t think the Kansas Legislature should weigh in on it.”
In terms of compensation, the Legislature maneuvered to nearly double their own salaries on Jan. 1. The decision was made to decouple the state Board of Education from the Legislature in terms of daily compensation for travel costs and expenses tied to work for the state. Toward the end of the 2025 session, a bill surfaced with the human development curriculum mandate and a provision directing the state Board of Education to set its own compensation rate. It didn’t include funding to the state Board of Education to address any costs. The state Board of Education plans to take up the issue during a meeting in May.
“They’ll certainly have to do something with it, because the new law says you shall set your rate. So even if they set it where it is now, they’re going to have to take some action to do that,” Watson said.
 
Governor, president
In January, the governor proposed the Legislature pay the cost of meals for children enrolled in the state’s reduced-price school meal program. She suggested lawmakers allocate $5.5 million to provide free rather than subsidized meals to about 36,000 students statewide. With federal assistance, Kansas currently provides free meals to about 40% of students in public schools or approximately 200,000 youths.
Kelly’s idea was for the state to cover the reduced-meal cost for each child at 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch.
“We can reduce childhood hunger, we can reduce the stigma our low-income students face in our school cafeterias, and we can increase academic success,” Kelly said.
Watson said the Republican-led Legislature didn’t buy into the governor’s idea for supplementing the cost of school meals for children in lower-income families.
“What Governor Kelly was proposing is putting some state money into that, but that was not adopted in this legislative session,” he said.
Watson also reflected on lessons learned through former President George W. Bush’s ambitious No Child Left Behind program from 2002 to 2015. It was designed to hold schools accountable for learning among all students, including subgroups of low-income students, students with disabilities and students of color. The objective was to have every student reach proficient levels in math and reading.
NCLB became controversial because it penalized schools that didn’t show annual improvement on standardized student tests. State assessments should be viewed as a measure of how students were doing academically instead of the lone metric of success or failure, Watson said.
“President Bush was thinking, we want kids to learn how to read and do math. It’s a great goal. It’s a noble goal. And I would applaud that,” Watson said. “When we put that into law, I don’t think he could have foreseen what the consequences were going to be if you were going to require that. What happened is that, at least in Kansas, I won’t speak to other states, but I think it’s pretty typical teachers said, ‘Well, then we won’t teach science. We won’t teach social studies. Oh, we’ll cut recess out. We teach to that test because it became so high stakes.’ ”
He said NCLB affirmed chasing student test scores just to obtain a mark acceptable to politicians shouldn’t be the primary focus of a classroom teacher, school principal, district superintendent or school board member.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/250418_watson-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-21 11:13:51.102508

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)In February, the Trump administration sent a letter to all state education departments with a broad message: diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in public schools must come to an end. Every public K-12 school and university must stop policies related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or face a potential loss to their funding, the letter stated.
This month, a New Hampshire federal judge is grappling with whether to stop the government from enforcing the letter.
A group of organizations – the National Education Association, the National Education Association of New Hampshire, and the Center for Black Educator Development – have sued the U.S. Department of Education in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire to block enforcement of the letter. The suit is being litigated by the American Civil Liberties Union’s Racial Justice Program and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire.
On Thursday, Judge Landya McCafferty presided over oral arguments in the lawsuit. She’s weighing whether to issue a preliminary injunction.
The requirement is not immediate; after an extension agreed to earlier this month, state education agencies have until April 24 to certify that the state’s schools have agreed to the conditions in the letter. But plaintiffs are hoping McCafferty issues the injunction sometime this week to halt enforcement before that deadline arrives.
Plaintiffs argue that because the letter threatens financial repercussions against school districts that allow for DEI programs, it could in turn force schools to drop support for NEA and CBED teacher diversity programs. And the NEA says the vagueness of the letter will push its teacher members to take defensive measures and avoid teaching certain topics if they think there will be professional consequences for doing so.
But the government says plaintiffs are overreacting to the letter, which they say simply warns school districts not to fall afoul of Title VI, a federal statute that prevents discrimination in public programs based on race or national origin, and promises investigations and potential withholding of federal funding for those districts that do.
The letter that kicked off the dispute, known as a “dear colleague letter,” presents a stark portrait of public schools.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” the letter reads. “Proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them — particularly during the last four years — under the banner of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’…”
The letter relies on Students for Fair Admissions Inc v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, a landmark 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the court held that the race-based admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina had violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
And it says the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights would “vigorously enforce the law” and that institutions that failed to comply with federal law may “face potential loss of federal funding.”
“The Department will no longer tolerate the overt and covert racial discrimination that has become widespread in this Nation’s educational institutions. The law is clear: treating students differently on the basis of race to achieve nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice, or equity is illegal under controlling Supreme Court precedent.”
To the U.S. Department of Justice, the letter is not an official agency rule; rather, it is an interpretive guidance. That means it can’t be struck down by a court the way a rule can, they argued.
Abhishek Kambli, a U.S. deputy associate attorney general who traveled to Concord to argue the case Thursday, said the letter is simply articulating existing law preventing school districts from classifying students according to their race. Kambli pointed to the Students for Fair Admissions decision, and said the dear colleague letter is simply trying to stop K-12 schools from that kind of discrimination, Kambli told the court Thursday. Already, U.S. case law has established that schools should not make distinctions on the basis of race or other characteristics except in rare circumstances, Kambli argued. And he said those circumstances must face a legal test of strict scrutiny to pass.
The plaintiff’s hardship, Kambli said, “is due to self-censorship based on a misunderstanding of what the dear colleague letter says.”
Kambli added that the government does not claim diversity, equity, and inclusion itself is illegal; rather, it claims that schools that are already breaking the law by classifying students by race should not use the concept of DEI as an excuse to do so.
And he said despite the colorful language in the letter, any decision by the federal government to withhold funding to a school could come only after an investigation, and would include the possibility of an appeal. “It’s a lengthy process,” he said.
But plaintiffs say the government’s characterization understates the impact and scope of the letter.
The letter creates the possibility of consequences for teachers because of its threat to punish school districts, who directly employ those teachers, Sarah Hinger, deputy director of the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program argued Thursday. And she said the letter contains pronouncements that are hard for teachers to apply to their instruction.
“Every day, today, tomorrow, they go to work and they are tasked with following the dear colleague letter, along with all their other obligations,” Hinger said. “They are chilled now in their ability to speak… They are uncertain of what practices they can engage in.”
Hinger also pointed to the Trump administration’s swift move to withhold funding from Columbia University and Harvard University, suggesting that the administration could move quickly to block funding to public schools if it decides to.
“The chill from that is happening now, and plaintiffs are not required to wait until they are hauled into court in order to challenge an unconstitutional law,” she said. McCafferty appeared sympathetic to plaintiffs, asking Kambli questions about how teachers could cover periods of American history like Reconstruction or the Jim Crow South without worrying they were improperly teaching that America has structural racism.
The case bears similarity to another lawsuit alleging that New Hampshire’s 2021 “banned concepts” law prohibiting public school teachers from advocating for certain topics around race and gender is unconstitutional. In 2024, the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire agreed with plaintiffs and struck that law down; the decision is currently being appealed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
But Kambli said those lawsuits were different because they involved state laws that directly affected teachers. The dear colleague letter should not have a direct effect on the topics that can be taught, he argued.
“It goes toward how they treat students,” he said. “It doesn’t go toward what they teach.”
And Kambli argued the suing organizations are not linked directly to the Department of Education’s enforcement action, and lack standing to bring a case in the first place.
Lawyers for the ACLU are attempting to add a handful of New Hampshire school districts as parties to the case, in order to make additional arguments about how the letter would unfairly affect them. But the government argued it needs more time to file a motion countering those arguments, and McCafferty has not yet approved the districts’ inclusion to the case.
For now, the parties are expecting McCafferty to issue a ruling on the injunction before this Thursday. Lawyers for the government asked her to issue a narrow injunction that affects only the named plaintiffs if she must issue one; lawyers for the plaintiffs urged a nationwide injunction.
Under the agreement, any New Hampshire school district that signs a letter certifying that they will comply with the letter will not be bound to that letter until April 24, meaning that if the court enjoins the letter before then, the district will not be subject to it. As of last week, 165 New Hampshire school districts have signed on, according to the Department of Education’s website.
Maine’s Department of Education has asked districts to refrain from signing on to the guidance while the state issues a response, according to Ed Week.
At a press conference after the hearing, Hinger said she hopes McCafferty will act quickly.
“I think that the government has shown a track record of avoiding and ignoring careful due process, moving swiftly against institutions and using the full power of its authority against individuals in the education sector and beyond,” she said.

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.


In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity director


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

This week: what a drop in international tourism means for Minnesota; the most conservative and liberal workplaces; how trucks and SUVs drive road congestion; and meaningful jobs. 
International tourism takes a hit
The Washington Post reported last week that international tourism to the U.S. is plummeting at the start of the second Trump administration. In March, “overseas visitors fell nearly 12% compared with the same time last year, according to data from the International Trade Administration, an agency under the U.S. Department of Commerce,” the paper reports.
The reasons aren’t terribly complicated: Trump seems determined to turn the U.S. into a pariah state, with every day bringing new horror stories of travelers being detained, deported and refused admittance.
In 2023, more than 500,000 international tourists visited Minnesota, according to Explore Minnesota, spending a little over $500 million in the state. The agency had been forecasting 2025 would bring 700,000 international visitors and $700 million in spending, but that’s now unlikely.
More than half of Minnesota’s international tourists hail from Canada. The administration’s ongoing belligerence toward our northern neighbor has fueled a fierce backlash. Minnesota businesses relying on those visitors are likely to be especially hard hit. 
“I don’t want to pay into their economy, I’m going to stay in Winnipeg and go to local events here, put my money here,” one Winnipeg resident told a city newspaper. “And who knows what’ll happen? What if you get your car keyed? We don’t know how they’re going to treat Canadians going down,” she added.
Measuring workforce politics
Last month a team of researchers released a new dataset on the political affiliations of workers at hundreds of thousands of American employers. They did this by linking public voter registration data to online worker profiles maintained by many employers.
They found that workplaces in their sample tend to lean left, with more than 60% of employees identifying as a Democrat (for simplicity’s sake, independents and those not registered with one of the two major parties were excluded from this calculation). But some industries are much more conservative or liberal than others, and the same goes for individual workplaces.
At Target, for instance, fewer than 30% of identifiable employees are registered Republican. Privately owned agriculture behemoth Cargill, on the other hand, has close to a 60% Republican workforce.
“In the context of growing political polarization, employers are entering the political arena in unprecedented ways,” the authors write. “Given the potentially critical role that workers play in shaping these actions, it is critical to have wide-reaching, representative measures of workers’ personal politics.”
Trucks and SUVS are clogging up the roadways, study finds
MPR News reports on a recent study using Minnesota traffic data to analyze how the exploding popularity of trucks and sport-utility vehicles affects traffic flows on roadways.
Minnesota has some of the best traffic data in the United States, the authors note, with reliable numbers going back to the 1990s. That allows researchers to get a sense of how things have changed.
The study looked at the freeway network around Minneapolis and St. Paul, and found that “the average network throughput decreases from approximately 1850 vehicles per lane per hour in 1995 to about 1600 vehicles per lane per hour in 2019.” 
The authors attribute that to the growing popularity of small trucks and SUVs, which take up more space on the road.
“The number of vehicles it takes to reach a congested level of traffic is fewer, and so you’re more likely to see congestion for the same number of people traveling because people are in SUVs and vans and pickup trucks, but especially SUVs,” co-author David Levinson told MPR.
The study found that while the total number of registered vehicles in Minnesota grew by 36% from 1995 to 2019, the number of SUVs increased by more than 1,000%.
1 in 5 Americans say their job “is not making a meaningful contribution to the world”
A recent YouGov survey found that while most American workers say their job makes a difference, 20% told the pollster that their job is essentially meaningless.
People with so-called email jobs — sending and receiving emails and Slack messages and attending meetings — were actually more likely to characterize their jobs as meaningful, although this is probably a function of education: More educated people are also more likely to say their jobs mean something, and they’re also more likely to do email jobs.
Americans who think their own jobs are meaningless are also much more likely to take a dim view of the value of other people’s jobs.
Incidentally, workers in the U.K. are nearly twice as likely as those in the U.S. to say their jobs are meaningless.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2197666840.jpg,,,2025-04-21 11:13:51.102508

Dr. Jessica Lowe, a neurologist and epileptologist at Bayhealth, has been named the 2025 Delaware Woman of Impact by the American Heart Association (AHA) as part of its Go Red for Women initiative.
The recognition comes after a spirited nine-week campaign in which Lowe led a series of community-focused events and fundraising efforts aimed at fighting heart disease and stroke among women.
Lowe raised $88,000 in donations and earned additional “impact points” through educational and wellness initiatives, ranking fifth overall in the AHA’s Eastern States Region—an area that spans 11 states.
“It was important for me to participate in Woman of Impact because, as a physician, I see firsthand how cardiovascular disease affects women at every stage of life,” Lowe said. “I want to be part of the change that helps ensure women have the knowledge and tools they need to protect their health. I am honored to have received this recognition and am excited to continue working alongside the American Heart Association and its Go Red for Women initiative to help ensure all women know their risk factors and have the information they need to live longer, healthier lives.”

Her campaign included lectures on stroke and neurological health, a steps challenge, goat yoga, and digital outreach through her Instagram platform, @Doctorbrainbarbie.
“Thanks to the efforts of incredible leaders like Dr. Lowe and all of our nominees, we’re making strides to ensure all women in Delaware are seen, heard and counted when it comes to their health,” said Jim Murphy, executive director of the American Heart Association, Delaware. “Together, we have the power to help ensure more women are represented in research, have the information they need for heart health through every stage of life and receive quality and timely care. The power of our community coming together creates better health outcomes for all of us.”
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death for women in the United States, taking the life of 1 in 3 women each year.
The Woman of Impact campaign, which launched on National Wear Red Day (February 7), is part of the AHA’s broader effort to raise awareness and improve health outcomes through its Go Red for Women movement.
Lowe was one of two Delaware-based nominees in the 2025 campaign.
The other nominee, Dr. Sarah Beebe, Simulation Lab Program Manager at Bayhealth, also contributed to community wellness efforts, including CPR training for over 500 people and multiple educational events.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-21-at-10.03.11-AM.png,,,2025-04-21 11:13:51.102508

This would allow voters to vote on machines in the same way they would on election day, but with the flexibility to do so ahead of time.","Georgia is among the battleground states that since the 2020 presidential election has enacted new laws that could restrict voting access. (Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)Pennsylvania voters have been given a raw deal when it comes to early voting options. As we head into another round of municipal elections, voters across the Commonwealth again face the dilemma of whether or not they should stand in long lines to cast their ballots early. Although the problem is worse in some counties than others, it is unacceptable anywhere.
Pennsylvania’s current no-excuse mail ballot system is a good idea on paper, but the long lines early voters face are due to the fact that many voters are filling out their mail ballots in person before they turn them in, likely because they want to ensure they are filled out correctly and will, therefore, be counted.
Therefore, in a state where nearly half of all counties don’t even have a ballot drop box, a strong, well-funded, and complementary-to-no-excuse-mail-ballots system that encourages early voting done in person is an absolute must.
Currently, our counties are not equipped to handle the volume of voters trying to cast their ballots before Election Day because our no-excuse mail ballot system isn’t designed for accessible in-person voting. We need more. The fact that voters are so eager to vote early is exactly why we need a modernized system that can meet this overwhelming demand.
Without the infrastructure in place for true early voting, not only do Pennsylvania voters have to suffer through long lines, but it also causes unnecessary stress on our election workers who already face enormous challenges. Election workers and voters deserve a process that is as efficient, safe, and accessible as possible—one that ensures every voter has a fair chance to have their voice heard.
The solution is obvious: Pennsylvania needs to establish an official system for in-person early voting. This would allow voters to vote on machines in the same way they would on election day, but with the flexibility to do so ahead of time.
To make this a reality, our election offices need to be fully funded and staffed to meet the demand. It’s not just a nice-to-have option; it’s a necessity to ensure that Pennsylvania’s election system actually works for voters and election workers – and that democracy includes all of us.
This is not some far-fetched idea, either. Pennsylvania leaders can look to nearby states that have provided a clear blueprint for success. In Michigan, where in-person early voting was implemented in time for last year’s general election, there was a marked increase in voter turnout before Election Day.
  Voting booths set up at Madison, Wisconsin’s Hawthorne Library on Election Day 2022. (Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)
According to a recent data analysis released by my organization, All Voting is Local, more than 58 percent of Michigan voters cast their ballots before Election Day in 2024. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, only 27 percent of voters cast their ballots early.
This difference is not just a statistic. It’s a sign that having a statewide plan works when it comes to early voting. In Michigan, the establishment of early voting polling locations allowed voters to cast their ballots ahead of time and reduced long lines on Election Day itself.
This increase in early voting turnout wasn’t limited to one political party or one region—it was a broad, statewide trend. When early voting options are made accessible, voters from all walks of life take advantage of them, because let’s not mince words: long lines are a form of suppression that can deter voters from casting their ballots.
Pennsylvania voters want more voting options, a fact that was made crystal clear in November as they stood in hours-long lines both before and on Election Day. They want to be able to cast their ballots securely without having to wait in line for hours. Most importantly, they want a system that ensures they have a voice in their own democracy.
Without in-person early voting, the voters most impacted will be parents, students, and all working-class folks who often don’t have time to wait in voting lines. Although the lack of in-person early voting disproportionately affects these voters, it’s an issue that impacts all voters. The problem needs to be addressed before voters find themselves standing in long lines again.
Fortunately, we know what the solution is to the problem. This is where Pennsylvania legislators have an opportunity. The window to make meaningful changes to our election code is now. By implementing in-person early voting, Pennsylvania can not only ensure greater voter turnout but also ensure that all voters—regardless of their background—have a fair shot at participating in our democracy. We’ve seen it work elsewhere, and we know it can work here.
Without this change, Pennsylvania voters will continue to face long lines and frustration at the polls. Our election officials will continue to struggle with an outdated system that isn’t equipped to meet the needs of today’s electorate. Without immediate action, we will fail to meet the moment and risk disenfranchising voters in a state that prides itself on being a critical battleground in national elections.
In Pennsylvania, we have the power to make our election system better, more inclusive, and more accessible. But this change can only happen if our leaders in the state legislature act now to make real early voting options a reality. Let’s ensure that every Pennsylvanian has the opportunity to cast their ballot early without unnecessary hurdles. It’s time for Pennsylvania to put in place a system that works for everyone.

Delaware dog owners now have a faster, easier way to license their pets—and bring them home if they ever get lost.
The Office of Animal Welfare (OAW) has teamed up with pet registration provider DocuPet to roll out a new online dog licensing platform and lost pet recovery service across the state.
The user-friendly system is designed to streamline the licensing process and strengthen efforts to reunite lost pets with their families.
Tracking lost dogs
Under the new program, canine owners who register their pets on the DocuPet platform will receive a uniquely coded ID tag linked to a secure online profile.
If a pet goes missing, owners can quickly create a Lost Pet Report.
Anyone who finds a lost canine can use the tag’s code to file a Found Pet Report in seconds. A 24/7 dispatch team is also on hand to help reconnect pets and owners at any hour.
READ: Volunteers needed to help protect Delaware’s beach-nesting birds
“Our new partnership with DocuPet will be extremely valuable to dog owners and necessary for animal safety within the state,” said Christina Motoyoshi, director of OAW. “Licensing your dog helps reduce the number of animals in shelters, freeing up space and resources for pets in need. Licensing also helps to ensure public safety and support critical animal services to our community. We’re excited for residents to take advantage of this program to help keep their own pets and others in the community safe.”
Dog licensing is required by law in Delaware for all dogs six months or older and must be accompanied by proof of rabies vaccination.
To encourage pet owners to comply, the state is waiving late fees for expired licenses through July 15, 2025. Existing licenses will remain valid until their expiration.
Pet owners can sign up here, where they can also choose from standard or customizable designer tags.
As a bonus, the promo code “LICENSES” offers $5 off designer tags for a limited time.
The initiative is part of OAW’s ongoing mission to promote animal welfare and public safety across Delaware. T
he program is supported by Delaware Animal Services (DAS), the enforcement arm of OAW that handles dog control, rabies response, and animal cruelty investigations.

Photo courtesy of Ryan Fiereck. If you’re a reader, a student of history, or a writer, it’s been appalling to watch book bans proliferate across the nation. As The Reformer reported last month, St. Francis High School and Independent School District 15 recently adopted a policy that defers to Booklooks, a website linked to the far-right group Moms for Liberty when evaluating which books to purchase or pull from shelves.
The result: Hundreds of books are now either banned outright or will likely be pulled from shelves in the near future; this includes classics like The Handmaid’s Tale, The Bluest Eye, and soon, perhaps the likes of “Night” by Elie Wiesel and “Slaughterhouse Five” by Kurt Vonnegut and hundreds of others.
I graduated from St. Francis High School in 2001. I owe much of my career as a writer — I’ve written ten books and edited many more — to one of the soon-to-banned books. It was “Slaughterhouse Five.” It was the year 2000. Frosted tips and Billabong shirts were everywhere. I picked up the book from a spinner in my journalism class. (That teacher was the best teacher I ever had.) I absorbed it, and I proceeded to read every other book by Vonnegut on the spinner, and then Ray Bradbury; soon I was reading Sylvia Plath and Richard Wright. A good book is a springboard to others; the best books lead to a lifetime of a reading.
Rather than trot out generic arguments about why book bans are ill-advised, I want to talk about “Slaughterhouse Five.” It’s a fictionalized story, that like all truly great fiction, is, at its heart, true. Vonnegut was a G.I. in World War II. He was in the 106th Infantry Division and was captured during the Battle of the Bulge. To put that another way: The St. Francis school board wants to ban a novel written by an American serviceman and a member of the Greatest Generation.
  Published by Penguin Random House.
Vonnegut was forced to do manual labor in Dresden, and he survived the firebombing of the city in February 1945 by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. 8th Air Force. The resulting firestorm killed perhaps 35,000 people. “Slaughterhouse Five” is superficially science fiction, but it’s really about the insanity of war, the absurdity of surviving one, and more than anything, PTSD. Vonnegut’s writing will last forever because he’s irreverent, funny, and accessible, but he’s also honest and fundamentally decent.
That’s why Vonnegut appeals to younger readers; kids aren’t just picky eaters; they are picky readers. You have to meet them where they are in terms of attitude, interest, and style. By removing some of the most popular books among young people — classics and newer books alike — the district is depriving students of great books but also the love of reading and learning itself.
And as a rule, if you’re banning books, you’re afraid of ideas: The Soviets were afraid of capitalism, religion, and freedom of speech. The Nazis loathed the Jews, “inferior” races, modernism in all its forms, and were racist to their core. The Inquisition banned or targeted works by Copernicus and Galileo and Giordano Bruno because they feared their monopoly on cosmology was at an end. The ideas that Booklooks, and by extension, The St. Francis School Board, fear are plain. Even the most cursory look at its anonymous “ratings” (available on Internet Archive) shows that the books it targets are by or about women, LGBTQ folks, Black and brown folks, or people who have a “different” point of view. Like any attempt at censorship, it’s an exercise in erasure.
But I can promise you this: It won’t work. As the packed school board meetings, recent student protests, and a pair of newly filed lawsuits against the district make clear, people care about the freedom to read, the First Amendment, and the books and characters they love. 
This misguided policy has already been an expensive debacle, and the district has made statewide news in the most embarrassing way. If the policy remains in force, it will continue to hurt the district’s own students by depriving them of great works of art, and worse, giving them an incomplete, myopic view of the world.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/St.-Francis-Banned-Books-1-1024x868.jpg,,,2025-04-21 10:05:53.445210

Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.

Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s Congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The Federal Building housed federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995. Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

A recent court order could put the money back in circulation, but the administration has yet to signal if it will fully comply. U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy of Rhode Island, who was nominated by President Donald Trump in 2019 during his first term in office, ordered the administration to release the funding last week. 
The following day, the administration filed notice that it intends to comply with the nationwide order. On Sunday, however, the organizations that sued over the funding freeze filed their own notice, saying that the grant funds “remain inaccessible” even after McElroy’s order. 
Angela Ehlers is the executive director of the South Dakota Association of Conservation Districts. Her organziation is not a party to the lawsuit, but has been awarded some of the funds now in dispute and works closely with other grantees affected by the executive order.
The money flowed through the Inflation Reduction Act, and were paused under direction from the U.S. Department of Agriculture after a Jan. 20 executive order from President Trump. The Inflation Reduction Act was authorized by Congress and signed into law under former President Joe Biden in 2022.
Ehlers said there’s been no clear sign of if or when they’ll be restored since the Jan. 20 0rder, which has been a frustration for those relying on them.
“These aren’t regulatory programs,” Ehlers emphasized. “They’re voluntary, and the fact that they’ve been frozen without explanation creates a chilling effect across the entire landscape.”
The pause impacted billions in conservation spending nationwide and sparked the lawsuit that led to last week’s order from Judge McElroy. Projects designed to support beginning farmers have also stalled. 


DOGE cuts in SD
This is part of a series on the impact of mass federal firings, funding freezes and grant cancellations in South Dakota. For future and prior reporting, see Searchlight’s DOGE in SD page.


Ehlers said her association had partnered with South Dakota State University to support young producers entering agriculture through sheep and goat production. The grant-funded effort is meant to offer a way into agriculture for young producers but doubles as a conservation measure, because sheep and goat production requires less land and capital than cattle or grain farming.
“There’s a real opportunity here,” Ehlers said, but added “we just don’t know” if the grant funding will continue.
Leaders in water quality and habitat restoration programming along the Big Sioux River are in  a similar wait-and-see scenario.
Most watershed project funding remains available, according to Jay Gilbertson, manager of the East Dakota Water Development District. But staff losses and hiring freezes have undercut the delivery of on-the-ground support.
“Even if you don’t reduce the program funding, who’s going to do the work?” Gilbertson said. “If you fire someone who’s approving payments or working directly with farmers, it creates a massive gap in capacity.”
Travis Entenman, director of Northern Prairies Land Trust and Friends of the Big Sioux River, said the downstream impacts of federal uncertainty are already reaching local landowners. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), which helps farmers and ranchers integrate conservation into their operations, has seen funding pauses, he said. That’s left some landowners without reimbursement for practices they installed on the promise of repayment.
“Some of it’s open, but there’s still money frozen,” Entenman said. “And these programs are often receipt-based, meaning landowners put their own money on the line expecting reimbursement.”



Frozen conservation funds in limbo:
$51 million in climate-smart agriculture projects:

$25 million to Ducks Unlimited to restore 25,000 acres of grassland and help ranchers better manage grazing.
$18.3 million to South Dakota Agricultural Land Trust to offer easement payments to conserve 8,000 acres of ranchland near the Black Hills.
$8 million to South Dakota State University to help farmers identify unprofitable acres and suggest better land uses.

$83 million in grassland and conservation grants:

$24 million to Pheasants Forever & Quail Forever to use prescribed fire to remove invasive Eastern red cedar trees and restore prairie grasses on up to 125,000 acres.
$21 million to InterTribal Buffalo Council to restore native grassland ecosystems using sustainable buffalo grazing practices across tribal lands.
$20 million to The Nature Conservancy to purchase voluntary conservation easements on 20,000 acres in western South Dakota to prevent development.
$11 million to South Dakota Second Century Habitat Fund to convert low-quality cropland into grasslands suitable for grazing and haying.
$5 million to The Buffalo Nations Grasslands Alliance to identify and restore marginal croplands across 16 tribal nations.
$1.2 million to The Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate to create a tool to measure the environmental impact of agriculture on the reservation.

,California,2025-04-21 13:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Special interests poured more than half a billion into California lobbying last year,Jeremia Kimelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/data/2025/04/california-lobbying-spending-2024/,"Google, oil companies and utilities helped push California lobbying to a record $540 million in 2024, up 10% from the year before.","In summary
Google, oil companies and utilities helped push California lobbying to a record $540 million in 2024, up 10% from the year before.


Lobbying groups spent more than half a billion dollars to influence the state government in 2024, the most ever, according to a CalMatters analysis of data recently filed with the secretary of state. Lobbying by Google, oil companies and utilities during special sessions in the third quarter appeared to drive the sharp spike in spending.
Companies and organizations reported roughly $540 million in lobbying expenses to push their point of view to California officials, including legislators, on hundreds of bills between January and December of last year — and that’s up by more than 10% from $485 million in 2023.

Perhaps that isn’t so surprising in a state with a full-time Legislature and one of the largest economies in the world, said Francesco Trebbi, an economics professor at UC Berkeley who studies political influence and lobbying.
“Half a billion is kind of normal,” he said. “If California is about 14% of U.S. GDP and federal lobbying is about $4 billion, $500 million is about 13% of that. So it would be in line with the size of the California economy.”
Thomas Holyoke, a professor of political science at Fresno State University, said that the spending increase might reflect not only corporations’ desire for more influence but also the growing influence of California policy itself.
As long as California maintains its prominence, “more and more interest groups and lobbyists are going to take what Sacramento does very, very seriously,” he said.
 
 

Major players driving the lobbying boom
The Western States Petroleum Association reported more than $17.3 million dollars in advocacy costs over the year, more than $10 million of which was spent last summer, and more than double the total bill of the previous year.
The organization took public positions on 18 bills last session and got its desired outcome two-thirds of the time, according to a CalMatters analysis of data from Digital Democracy, our platform to track state lawmakers and legislation.
In part, the trade group’s spending more than doubled because of increased proposed regulations on oil and gas, including a special session focused on gas prices.
The largest non-oil spender was PacifiCorp, which reported spending more than $13.4 million to influence California officials last year, 30 times the yearly average for the company over the last two decades. The investor-owned utility lobbied for a rate hike but didn’t take a public position on any bills in 2024.
Pacific Gas & Electric, one of the largest utilities in the state, reported nearly $3.6 million on lobbying last year. Over the two-year legislative session, the company took a public position on 45 bills and also got its way on roughly two-thirds of them, or 31 bills.
Google doesn’t usually spend much on state-level lobbying efforts but spent more in 2024 than the last 20 years combined.

The company reported one of the largest totals for state advocacy last year, driven primarily by a spending spree in the third quarter of the year when the tech giant was fighting a media bill and AI regulations. The company got its way in both cases.
Much of its advocacy went through the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which reported spending nearly $7.4 million, $7 million of which came from the Mountain View behemoth.
Only two labor groups spent more than $1 million on lobbying last year: the Service Employees International Union and the California Teachers Association.
SEIU reported spending nearly $3.4 million and the California Teachers Association, another powerful union in the state, spent more than $3.1 million. Both unions took public positions on hundreds of bills and got their way nearly 70% of the time.

How CalMatters analyzed the data
Organizations that hire lobbyists to influence state policy are required to disclose how much money was spent in a quarterly report to the secretary of state, who makes the data and filings available online. For example, the page for the Western States Petroleum Association shows that the industry group spent roughly $1.7 million on advocacy in the second quarter of last year and more than $10.1 million in the following quarter.
CalMatters added quarterly reported expenses to calculate the total annual lobbying bill for each organization, then added every organization’s yearly sum to determine the aggregate amount spent on lobbying California officials per year.
Sometimes, organizations give money to industry groups to lobby on their behalf, such as the $7 million Google paid to the Computer & Communications Industry Association, and both organizations must report that money: Google, when it buys advocacy services from the association; the trade group, when it actually spends the money on grassroots organizing or direct lobbying. Because there’s no way to determine if a payment is to another “lobbyist employer” or to a political or media consulting firm, there are amounts reported more than once in our data.
CalMatters determined the success rate of each organization by comparing organizations’ public positions taken on bills in the last legislative session (2023–2024) as recorded in Digital Democracy to the ultimate outcome of that legislation. Lobbying efforts were considered successful if either of the following were true:

The organization opposed a bill that failed the Legislature.
The organization supported a bill that passed through the Legislature (even if it was vetoed by the Governor).

It’s difficult to get a more detailed picture of lobbying because of what isn’t reported in the data. California does not require disclosure of either the offices or staff members who meet with lobbyists or the connections between individual lobbyists and specific bills.
Our analysis found that corporate lobbying efforts were successful about 60% of the time. This is likely an undercount because it can take more than one year to successfully pass a bill.
Micheli said that sometimes a bill can even take more than one two-year legislative session.
“After six or seven years on a really tough bill, you finally get it enacted. Leading up to it, you could say you failed every year,” he said. “But then eventually, you get a seismic change in the law.”

Volcanoes inspire awe with spectacular eruptions and incandescent rivers of lava, but often their deadliest hazard is what quietly falls from the sky.
When a large volcano erupts, as Mount Spurr appears close to doing about 80 miles from Anchorage, Alaska, it can release enormous volumes of ash. Fine ash can infiltrate the lungs of people and animals who breathe it in, poison crops and disrupt aquatic life. Thick deposits of ash can collapse roofs, cripple utilities and disrupt transport networks.
Ash may lack the visual impact of flowing lava, but as a geologist who studies disasters, I’m aware that ash travels farther, lasts longer and leaves deep scars.

Volcanic ash: What it is, and why it matters
Volcanic ash forms when viscous magma – molten rock from deep beneath Earth’s surface – erupts, exploding into shards of rock, mineral and glass carried in a near-supersonic stream of hot gas.
Towering clouds of ash rise several miles into the atmosphere, where the ash is captured by high-altitude winds that can carry it hundreds or even thousands of miles.
As the volcanic ash settles back to Earth, it accumulates in layers that typically decrease in thickness with distance from the eruption source. Near the vent, the ash may be several feet deep, but communities farther away may see only a dusting.

  When Mount Spurr erupted in 1992, a dark column of ash and gas shot into the atmosphere from the volcano’s Crater Peak vent. Wind patterns determine where the ash will fall. (U.S. Geological Survey photo)

Breathing danger: Health risks from ash
Breathing volcanic ash can irritate the throat and lungs, trigger asthma attacks and aggravate chronic respiratory conditions such as COPD.
The finest particles pose the greatest risk because they can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause death by asphyxiation in the worst cases. Mild, short-term symptoms often resolve with rest. However, the long-term consequences of ash exposure can include silicosis, a lung disease and a possible cause of cancer.
The danger increases in dry regions where fallen ash can be kicked up into the air again by wind or human activity.
Risks to pets and livestock
Humans aren’t the only ones at risk. Animals experience similar respiratory symptoms to humans.
Domestic pets can develop respiratory distress, eye inflammation and paw irritation from exposure to ash.

	Livestock face greater dangers. If grazing animals eat volcanic ash, it can damage their teeth, block their intestines and poison them.
During the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption in Iceland, farmers were advised to shelter sheep and cattle because the ash contained fluoride concentrations above the recognized safety threshold of 400 parts per million. Animals that remained exposed became sick and some died.
Harm to crops, soil and water
Soil and crops can also be damaged. Volcanic ash alters the acidity of soil and introduces harmful elements such as arsenic and sulfur into the environment.
While the ash can add nutrients such as potassium and phosphorus that enhance fertility, the immediate impact is mostly harmful.
Ash can smother crops, block sunlight and clog the tiny stomata, or pores, in leaves that allow plants to exchange gases with the atmosphere. It can also introduce toxins that render food unmarketable. Vegetables, fruit trees and vines are particularly vulnerable, but even sturdy cereals and grasses can die if ash remains on leaves or poisons emerging shoots.
Following the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, vast tracts of farmland in central Luzon in the Philippines were rendered unproductive for years due to acidic ash and buried topsoil. If multiple ashfalls occur in a growing season, crop failure becomes a near certainty. It was the cause of a historic famine that followed the eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815.

  Electron microscope images of ash show how sharp the shards are. The top left image of shards from Mount Etna in 2002 is 1 mm across. Top right is an ash particle from Mount St. Helens magnified 200 times. The shards in the lower images are less than 0.064 mm. (Volcano Hazards Program, U.S. Geological Survey photo)


	Ash can also contaminate surface water by introducing toxins and increasing the water’s acidity. The toxins can leach into groundwater, contaminating wells. Fine ash particles can also settle in waterways and smother aquatic plants and animals. During the 2008 Chaitén eruption in Chile, ash contamination led to widespread fish deaths in the Río Blanco.
Ash can ground airplanes, gum up infrastructure
Ash clouds are extremely dangerous to aircraft. The glassy ash particles melt when sucked into jet turbines, clog fuel systems and can stall engines in midair.
In 1982, British Airways Flight 9 lost power in all four engines after flying through an ash cloud. A similar incident occurred in 1989 to KLM Flight 867 over Alaska. In 2010, Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull eruption grounded more than 100,000 flights across Europe, disrupting travel for over 10 million passengers and costing the global economy billions of dollars.
Volcanic ash can also wreak havoc on infrastructure by clogging water supplies, short-circuiting electrical systems and collapsing roofs under its weight. It can disrupt transportation, communication, rescue and power networks, as the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines dramatically demonstrated.
What to do during ashfall
During an ashfall event, the most effective strategy to stay safe is to stay indoors as much as possible and avoid inhaling ash particles.
Anyone who must go outside should wear a properly fitted N95 or P2 mask. Cloth masks provide little protection against fine ash. Rainwater tanks, troughs and open wells should be covered and monitored for contamination. Livestock should be moved to clean pastures or given uncontaminated fodder.
To reduce structural damage, ash should be cleared from roofs and gutters promptly, especially before rainfall.
Older adults, children and people who are sick are at greatest risk, particularly those living in poorly ventilated homes. Rural communities that are dependent on agriculture and livestock are disproportionately affected by ashfall, as are low-income people who lack access to clean water, protective masks or safe shelter.
Communities can stay informed about ash risks through official alerts, including those from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers, which monitor ash dispersion and issue timely warnings. The International Volcanic Health Hazard Network also offers guidelines on personal protection, emergency planning and ash cleanup.
The long tail of ash
Volcanic ash may fall quietly, but its effects are widespread, persistent and potentially deadly. It poses a chronic threat to health, agriculture, infrastructure and aquatic systems.
Recognizing the risk is a crucial first step to protecting lives. Effective planning and public awareness can further help reduce the damage.

By the end of last summer, CalMatters data reporter Jeremia Kimelman recognized that 2024 was on its way to break lobbying spending records in California. With the year concluded and recent data filed with the secretary state, lobbying groups indeed spent an unrivaled amount of money in 2024 to influence state government: $540 million, or 10% more than the year before.
So who were the biggest spenders? 
Topping the list were oil companies, which were the main focus of a special session Gov. Gavin Newsom called last summer to address gas prices. The Western States Petroleum Association reported more than $17.3 million in advocacy costs in 2024 — including more than $10 million spent last summer. 
Electric company PacifiCorp and utility company Pacific Gas & Electric also spent big last year: PacifiCorp reported spending more than $13.4 million — about 30 times its yearly average in the last two decades — while Pacific Gas & Electric spent nearly $3.6 million.
But one standout is the tech and search giant Google, which poured $11.9 million into state-level lobbying in 2024 — more than it spent in the last 20 years combined. Last summer it successfully opposed two bills related to funding journalism and artificial intelligence regulations.
Given the state’s prominence as having one of the largest economies in the world, half a billion dollars in lobbying spending isn’t too surprising for some political and economic experts. During the 2023-24 legislative session, California also saw its biggest spike in registered lobbyists in more than a decade.

Thomas Holyoke, political science professor at Fresno State University: “More and more interest groups and lobbyists are going to take what Sacramento does very, very seriously.”

CA spared from other research funding cuts, for now

From CalMatters higher education reporter Mikhail Zinshteyn:
Another federal cut to university research, another lawsuit — and yet another judge halting the cuts for now.
While the proposed research cuts to universities by the National Institutes of Health have been a top concern for campuses, other federal agencies are big funders of research, too. The Department of Energy provided the University of California $162 million in research funding last year for 393 projects.The department under President Donald Trump wanted to cap a major source of that funding, called indirect costs, to 15% — much lower than the existing negotiated rates between campuses and the federal agency. The government said the move would save taxpayers $400 million annually. A coalition of universities and higher-education associations, which count UCs as members, sued last week. Days after, a federal Massachusetts judge temporarily halted the cuts. Indirect costs cover expenses to maintain labs and other major infrastructure for research.Calculating the true cost of those proposed Department of Energy losses for the UC is difficult, but the NIH also sought to lower those indirect rates to 15%. One calculation found that the UC would lose $460 million out of about $2.6 billion in funding the system gets for health science research annually.In the Department of Energy suit, California Institute of Technology indicated it spent $25 million on Department of Energy projects. A 15% cut to indirect costs would mean $6 million in losses for the school.



CA consumer group sues to prevent insurance surcharge

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
A consumer advocacy group sued the California Insurance Department last week because the state agency allowed private insurers to pass a $500 million surcharge to their customers.
The FAIR Plan — a state-mandated association of insurers that’s required to provide fire insurance to property owners who can’t get it elsewhere — asked the insurance department to approve a $1 billion “assessment” to help prop it up after the Los Angeles County fires, saying the plan was running out of money. The insurers in the plan are required to fund the assessment. But under two bulletins issued by Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara last fall and in February, insurers for the first time can recoup half of their cost by imposing fees on their customers — who are not on the FAIR Plan. 
CalMatters reported in February that Consumer Watchdog was considering legal action. It filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court last week, saying Lara violated one law that requires public comment on a regulation and review by the Office of Administrative Law. In addition, the group said Lara violated the state’s insurance code by “effectively (requiring) every California policyholder to reinsure their own insurer.” It asks the court to declare the bulletins invalid, and to order the insurance department to facilitate the return of any fees on insurance customers so far. 
Gabriel Sanchez, a spokesperson for the insurance department, said the lawsuit “fails to benefit consumers.” The insurance industry also slammed the lawsuit.

Denni Ritter, a vice president at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association: “It is critical that the costs be spread equitably across a broader pool of insured customers.”

According to a news release, Ellison has served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico in the Las Cruces Branch Office, most recently as supervisory assistant U.S. attorney of the Violent and General Crimes Section. In that capacity, a news release notes, Ellison prosecuted members of the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico prison gang, with more than 175 SNM gang members and associates thus far charged with serious federal crimes, “making the ongoing SNM prosecution the largest criminal case ever brought in the District of New Mexico.”
“I am grateful for the opportunity to serve the people of New Mexico in this role,” Ellison said in a statement. “For however long I serve as United States Attorney, my primary objective will be to keep New Mexicans safe through the vigorous enforcement of Federal law. Under my leadership, the United States Attorney’s Office will do its part to stem the unlawful flow of people and drugs into our country. We will also not lose sight of our responsibility to combat violent crime, gang activity, child predators, and to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States’ civil interests. Together with our federal, tribal, state, and local law enforcement partners, the United States Attorney’s Office will work tirelessly to make New Mexico a safer place to live, work, raise a family, and run a business. And we will make New Mexico a far less attractive place to commit a crime.”

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, the State House’s longest-serving member, died early Monday morning following a battle with cancer, according to a statement from his office. He was 76.
“It is with deepest sorrow that we announce the passing of Senate President Dominick J. Ruggerio earlier this morning,” the statement said. “We are so grateful for the love and support of his friends and colleagues. Throughout his illness, Donny fought valiantly, just as he always had for his constituents and the residents of Rhode Island.”
The North Providence Democrat was hospitalized at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital last week for a bad reaction to his treatment — returning less than five weeks after he was released from the same hospital and rehabilitation center for pneumonia. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said he was “heartbroken,” referring to Ruggerio as his “dear friend” in a statement Monday morning.
“I had enormous respect and admiration for his dedication and leadership,” Shekarchi said.  “Even through his illness, we communicated on nearly a daily basis about the important issues facing our state. Donny devoted his life to the people of Rhode Island, which will always be his legacy. This is the end of an era at the State House, where Donny was a true giant for well over four decades, beginning his career in the House in 1981 before moving to the Senate four years later.  On behalf of the House of Representatives, we extend our deepest sympathies to his family and his Senate colleagues, and we will miss him greatly.”
Ruggerio was absent for a majority of the 2025 sessions, attending just four of the 17 regularly scheduled Senate gatherings since January. He last presided over the chamber’s regular session on March 25.
Similar stretches of absence also characterized his leadership of the upper chamber in 2024, prompting a rival bid for the president role from his former second-in-command, Sen. Ryan Pearson. Ruggerio fended off the challenge with two-thirds of the votes of the Senate’s 34 Democrats. Despite his multiple absences, supporters remained steadfast in their public conviction that Ruggerio was the best pick to lead the chamber.
First elected to represent District 4 spanning parts of Providence and North Providence in 1985, Ruggerio, known to friends and colleagues as “Donny” was considered the “dean” of the Senate as its longest-serving member. The retired administrator for the New England Laborers Labor Management Coop Trust was tapped as majority whip in 2003. He ascended to Senate Majority Leader in 2010 and in 2017, was elected Senate President after former President Teresa Paiva Weed suddenly resigned.
A self-described moderate Democrat, Ruggerio leaned more conservative on gun and abortion issues, though his mindset shifted in his later years in leadership. In 2023, Ruggerio cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee that allowed the Equality in Abortion Coverage Act to advance to the full Senate, where it also passed and was signed into law. This year, he signaled new openness to a state assault weapons ban, which he previously opposed.
He was a strong voice for labor, small business and expanding the state’s legal gambling sector, leading the way for the state’s online sports betting in 2019 and in 2023, virtual slot and table games, or iGaming.
His biography on the General Assembly website highlights his recognition from The Humane Society of the United States, recognizing his efforts to prohibit double-decker horse trailers, as one of the standouts from his many awards and honors.
A lifelong North Providence resident, Ruggerio graduated from LaSalle Academy in 1966. He attended Bryant College, but earned a bachelor’s degree in 1974 from Providence College.
He served on the board of the Wanskuck Library and as a member of the Sons of Italy, Loggia Vittoria, and the DaVinci Center Development Committee.
Ruggerio was the father of two children, Charles and Amanda, with his ex-wife, Cynthia, and the grandfather to Ava, Mia, Natalie, and Jameson.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)As temperatures soared past 100 degrees in early October, Yajaira Rimendes, a 35-year-old former nurse, started to feel faint at a bus stop in North Las Vegas. It was midday and she was on her way to a chemotherapy appointment. She drank her only remaining water, which was already lukewarm, and passed out.
“I don’t remember much, but from what I remember I woke up in a hospital,” Rimendes said.
She was one of more than 3,500 heat-related emergency hospital visits reported in Southern Nevada last year, according to the Southern Nevada Health District. 
Last year Nevada experienced the hottest summer on record, and even into October, daily heat records were broken, triggering a re-activation of cooling centers. Temperatures on Oct. 4 reached 104 degrees, breaking the record for the hottest day ever recorded for the month.
Extended triple degree temperatures in 2024 also brought a surge of fatalities. State health officials recorded 526 heat-related deaths in Southern Nevada last year, a 78% increase from the 294 heat-related deaths in 2023.
After a record number of heat related deaths and hospitalizations in the state, lawmakers are considering measures this session designed to protect Nevadans whose vulnerability to heat is only rising with temperatures.
Rimendes joined dozens of Las Vegas residents on a trip to Carson City with the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition this month — traveling more than 400 miles — to push for several bills that would help Nevadans adapt and thrive as record-breaking temperatures and wildfire impact every aspect of their lives. 
Extreme heat exposure is a serious health hazard. It can cause heat rash, cramps, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke, which can be fatal or have lifelong consequences. Older people, people with disabilities, pregnant people, and children are at increased risk of adverse health impacts from heat, in some cases with fatal consequences.
At face value, policies to protect against the consequences of climate change seem like an obvious necessity, but lack of funding combined with fiercely anti-regulatory corporate interests and like-minded elected officials have made climate-related legislation difficult to pass.
One example is Assembly Bill 96, a measure that would mandate the Clark and Washoe counties, the state’s two most populous, to include a specific “heat mitigation” section within their development master plans. That would mean actively addressing extreme heat through urban planning strategies, like creating public cooling spaces, public water access, cool building practices, and shaded areas.
Nevada’s Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed a similar bill in 2023. His reasoning was that there’s “no data definitively supporting the proposition that development is causing rising temperatures in either Washoe County or Clark County.” 
In reality, one of the major consequences of urban development is the urban heat island that results in cities being, on average, warmer than adjacent rural landscapes. As natural land and vegetation is replaced by dark and heat-absorbing surfaces like asphalt and concrete, the urban heat island is amplified at night when stored daytime heat is emitted even when the sun is down.

After 18 years of living in Nevada, Rimendes said the heat feels different than it did even five years ago. It’s more persistent, and her mobile home is no longer effective enough at creating a barrier from the intensity of the summer heat in North Las Vegas.
Her observation is backed by data. From 2010 to 2019, the low temperature in Las Vegas increased by 7 degrees, according to the nonpartisan Climate Central research and communications group. Much of that increase can be attributed to explosive development in Las Vegas since the 1970s.
A recent comparative study of cities by the U.S. Geological Survey found that nearly 50% of the Las Vegas metro area was covered by heat-absorbing buildings, roads and sidewalks — more than any other city in the study — contributing to significantly higher air temperatures in the area. 
Nothing but a pole for shade
Nevada’s capital—where the Legislature meets once every two years— is 431 miles away from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area, where seven out of ten Nevadans live. That’s farther than Las Vegas to Phoenix. It’s farther than Las Vegas to Salt Lake City. It’s farther than Las Vegas to Los Angeles.
Tollis Hill, a Las Vegas resident, packed into the Carson City office of Sen. Edgar Flores (D-Las Vegas) with a dozen other Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition members to advocate for more action on climate change. 
Hill traveled with Chispa Nevada from Las Vegas to advocate for Senate Bill 260, a measure that would ensure that outdoor workers receive the protection when air quality reaches unhealthy levels due to the wildfire smoke. It was his first time ever going to Carson City or speaking to lawmakers. 
Nearly one-fifth of Nevada’s land area has been burned by wildfire in the past 40 years, landing the state fifth in the nation for land area burned by wildfires. More frequent and destructive wildfires have also impacted air quality for outdoor workers in the state from Reno to Las Vegas. Despite growing destructive wildfires in the state, there are currently no regulations to protect workers air quality during extreme weather events. 
Hill spent 15 years working casino security on the Las Vegas Strip, including seven years as an outside bike officer. He recalled times the air quality was so bad during wildfires that he couldn’t stop coughing and had to rely on an inhaler. 
“In 2022, when Southern Nevada was filled with wildfire smoke, my coworkers and I were still outside working. We were not provided the needed personal protective equipment, and using what we had was discouraged as it did not meet the company’s uniform code,” Hill said.

Members of the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition split up to speak to different legislators in order to maximize their lobbying time. They also provided comments during legislative hearings that coincided with their trip to Carson City.
Rimendes, the 35-year-old former nurse who is fighting cancer, has practiced telling her story in an effective and compelling way in 2-minutes or less — the time allotted by legislative committees to an individual to submit public comment on legislation during a hearing. 
There’s no guarantee any of the bills the coalition supports will make it into law at the end of the 120-day legislative session, despite lobbying efforts by coalition members. Alternatively, the measures could be approved, but in a much different form than what was originally proposed.
One example is Senate Bill 431. The measure’s original goal was to extend the state’s 9% live entertainment tax to sports teams ticket sales, which are currently exempted from the tax.  The bill would have dedicated the revenue to Nevada’s woefully underfunded public transit. 
State Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas), the bill’s sponsor, said if passed as originally written the bill could have brought the state $54.5 million in revenue. That funding could be used to improve transit wait times, upgrade bus shelters to provide shade, and expand routes.
Rimendes relies heavily on public transit, even on days when temperatures soar past 100 degrees. That means at times Rimendes is forced to wait up to an hour at a bus stop with nothing but a pole for shade. Drive past any major road in Las Vegas and you’ll find several bus stops without trees or shelters to keep people cool as they stand on hot concrete near a sizzling asphalt road.
“There isn’t any shade, there aren’t any benches, there’s no trees. Imagine 110 degree weather, standing out there in scorching hot sun,” Rimendes said. 
The bill was opposed by Golden Knights, a pro league hockey team, and the Reno Aces, a pro baseball team, each saying the bill would raise ticket prices.
Neal acknowledged it was “controversial” during a hearing while Rimendes and other Nevadans who had traveled from Las Vegas sat in the gallery.
“I apologize to the committee who will sit through lots and lots of opposition,” Neal said. 
Days later, the bill was stripped down during a work session, narrowing the live entertainment tax to only the resale of sports teams tickets. And instead of $54.5 million to improve public transit infrastructure, the bill is projected to generate $36.5 million.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/story3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 09:03:21.609108
,California,2025-04-21 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California lawmakers can do a lot to aid LA fire recovery. Steeper looting penalties aren’t part of that,Robert Greene,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/looting-penalties-los-angeles-fires/,"There were relatively few arrests inside evacuation zones during this year's LA firestorm, yet California legislators have put looting center stage. The bills would mostly enhance already-stiff penalties, raising questions about why Democrats are making such a fuss.","It is noteworthy that some of the earliest mentions of “looting” in news reports during this year’s deadly fires in Los Angeles County made the point that there actually wasn’t much of it.
Video circulated on social media purporting to show young Black men stealing goods from a home in Altadena during the Eaton Fire. But the claim was quickly debunked by KTLA reporter Chip Yost, who spoke to the impacted family and noted that the young men were residents of the house and their neighbors, who were quickly removing and bagging as much of their possessions as they could before the flames could destroy everything.
Similar scenes played out all over Altadena, Pacific Palisades, Malibu and other areas hard hit by the fires that began on Jan. 7 and spread quickly amid hurricane-force winds. Neighbors pitched in to help save pets, pictures, important documents and personal items.
It’s a fairly typical response during disaster emergencies like wildfires. Neighbors tend to come together. Looting, although not unusual during violent social uprisings, is rare during natural disasters.
But fears and false reports of looting are common.
The Los Angeles Police Department, whose jurisdiction includes Pacific Palisades, took to social media in the hours after fires broke out to rebut looting rumors. 
“At this time,” the LAPD said on X, “we have received no information regarding looting or other criminal activity in the affected areas.”
As the fires were beaten back, some people did come to the reeling neighborhoods to take advantage of the disaster, allegedly stealing goods from intact or partially destroyed homes, or in some cases sifting through ash for any valuables that somehow remained unburned. 
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department reported six arrests for burglary, three for grand theft and seven for entering a disaster area in Altadena; and one for burglary, two for attempted burglary and one for possession of burglary tools in Malibu. The Los Angeles, Pasadena and Santa Monica police departments also made arrests in fire zones, including some for looting, but also for arson, flying unauthorized drones, possession of illegal drugs or weapons, and other non-looting-related crimes. Arrests in the evacuation areas for all crimes hovered at around 100. 
In a disaster in which at least 30 people died, and in a county of 10 million people, that’s a rather low number and does not point to a widespread outbreak of looting during the fires and the immediate aftermath.
Read More: New fire maps put nearly 4 million Californians in hazardous zones. What does that mean for the people who live there?
So it’s maddening that so many members of the California Legislature have put looting center stage, pushing bills to lengthen jail and prison sentences for theft during emergencies. It’s a misdirection of public time, effort and money. And it glosses over the deep governmental failures that the fires exposed: The failure to send timely emergency evacuation orders to the west side of Altadena where at least 18 people died. The needlessly nerve-wracking false emergency warning sent to millions of county residents not affected by the fires. The lack of available water to fight the fires. Plus questions about inadequate brush clearance and confusion over just who was in charge of disaster response.
Senate Bill 571 by Sens. Bob Archuleta of Norwalk and Jesse Arreguín of Oakland will be heard Tuesday in the Senate Public Safety Committee. Assembly Bill 468 by Assemblymembers Jesse Gabriel of Encino, Jacqui Irwin of Thousand Oaks and Blanca Pacheco of Downey passed out of the Assembly Public Safety Committee earlier this month and comes to the Appropriations Committee Wednesday.
All of the lead authors are Democrats and most are considered among the Legislature’s more progressive members. Parallel bills have been authored by Republican members.
The bills differ in their details but all are based on the specious premise that lengthening sentences — in some cases by four months, in others by a year or two — would dissuade would-be perpetrators who are not discouraged by current looting penalties.
California’s history with anti-looting laws
What is looting? As used in California law, it means stealing during a declared emergency or in an evacuation zone. Although charged as a distinct crime rather than as a sentence enhancement, it can lengthen sentences for charges like residential burglary, grand theft and petty theft — crimes that already carry stiff penalties. Residential burglary, for example, is a felony that carries a sentence of up to six years in state prison. AB 468 would make that seven years. 
It’s hard to imagine a perpetrator thinking, “I’m ready to do six years, but seven? No way. I’ll pass.”
California law also already increases the minimum penalty for petty theft during an emergency and virtually guarantees jail time. These bills would further strip judges of authority to order no-jail probation based on individual circumstances.
The state’s political foes often claim, falsely, that California is a soft on crime state. For example, after Gov. Gavin Newsom approved Los Angeles County’s request to deploy the National Guard to help patrol evacuation zones, Elon Musk amplified an absurd post on X, the platform he owns, that California had previously “literally decriminalized looting.”
In fact, at least two people arrested after allegedly stealing from an evacuated house in Mandeville Canyon during the Palisades fire reportedly could face life sentences under the state’s notoriously tough three strikes law because they have two prior serious or violent felony convictions. That’s not even including the longer sentences under current looting laws, let alone new penalties put in place if the bills become law. 
California is one of only eight states with anti-looting laws. Of those, most were adopted amid 1960s race riots, but California adopted its laws after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. There were only a few reports of theft during the emergency, but it was in the midst of the state’s tough-on-crime era and longer sentences were popular.
The remaining 42 states prosecute and sentence thieves and vandals the same whether they commit their crimes during a state of emergency or during normal times. There is no data to support the notion that theft increases during disasters or in evacuation zones, or that any such increase, if it did exist, would be controlled by special looting-related sentences.
In fact, there is little data to suggest that longer sentences have any impact on crime at all. The authors of California’s latest anti-looting bills surely know that if they have read the reports of their own legislative analysts.
So why are supposedly progressive Democrats pushing so hard to pointlessly adopt longer sentences for thefts committed during emergencies?
It may be that they feel pressure to hold someone — anyone — accountable for the overwhelming pain and loss. They recently scuttled a bill to allow fire victims to sue oil companies for their role in climate change, because it was opposed by their allies in labor. It would be likewise politically hazardous to target emergency workers for failed warning systems, or insurance companies for onerous recovery procedures. But accused thieves make popular targets, even though they had nothing to do with the fires.
The bills also allow Democrats to continue burnishing the tough-on-crime credentials they sought last year with a legislative package to toughen sentences for shoplifters. But retail theft dropped because of stepped-up investigation and enforcement, not because of longer prison or jail terms. 
Besides, criminal sentences don’t give their constituents what they need.
In Altadena, which historically has a large Black community, members of the Essie Justice Group made more than 500 calls to ask residents how they’re doing and what they need from their elected officials to better support their recovery. They’re still analyzing their responses, but so far, group member Sadio Woods said, “Zero percent of those folks said anything about crime or looting.”
Woods did note that some residents who returned home were stopped by officials and “questioned as looters.”
That recalls the false rumors circulated by social media about supposed looters who were actually friends and family helping to save precious belongings. And it raises a troubling but undeniable concern about the effect of racism during disasters.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_CM_55.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-21 09:03:21.609108

Carlos Trujillo couldn’t sleep despite it being well past midnight. 
As both an immigrant and an immigration lawyer, Trujillo has been acutely tuned into the volatile nature of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. That night, in the early hours of April 11, as has often been the case lately, Trujillo’s mind drifted to worries about how the changes will impact his clients and what he can do to assist them. 
Those thoughts weren’t helped by an email that arrived in his inbox at 1 a.m. The opening line got straight to the point. 
“It is time for you to leave the United States,” reads the email from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It ends with a promise: “The federal government will find you.”
Trujillo initially assumed the email was for one of his clients. Then he realized the only name on the email was his own. 
“I was in a little bit of a shock,” said Trujillo, who became a citizen over a decade ago. “I was like, why is this happening?”

Trujillo is one of several U.S. citizens on the receiving end of what appears to have been a mass email campaign. The emails stated that the recipients’ parole had been terminated. But Trujillo has never had immigration parole, which allows immigrants to temporarily remain and, in some cases, work in the country. It is separate from the kind of parole used in a criminal justice context. 
Immigration lawyers in Massachusetts, Ohio, Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, as well as a doctor in Connecticut — all of whom are also citizens — reported receiving the same email as Trujillo. 
Customs and Border Patrol said in a statement that it used the “known email addresses” of immigrants to send the notices, which it acknowledged could have included immigration attorneys’ emails. 
“If a non-personal email — such as an American citizen contact — was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients,” the statement reads. “CBP is monitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.”
A broader strategy 
To Trujillo, the motivation behind the emails is clear.
“This is part of a new practice, and the practice is to instill fear in the Latino or the minority communities,” Trujillo said. “Why am I a part of the email? Was it a mistake? Was it that I am born and raised in Venezuela? I don’t know. It could be, because I know there have been mistaken communications by DHS, but because I don’t know — that unknown makes you worry.”
Maria Montes with Comunidades Unidas said the administration’s constantly changing policies have made it difficult for the nonprofit and other organizations to effectively respond within their communities. 
“The federal administration has organized a strategy to create chaos, confusion and fear all in the hopes that immigrants will choose to self deport,” Montes said. 
Trujillo has been an outspoken advocate for Utah’s immigrant community. He said he refuses to accept that his advocacy was linked to the email, although it did cross his mind.

“To think that there could be consequences for that in a country like the United States, I just can’t believe it,” he said. “It probably was a mistake, and I love this country so much that I think my first inclination is just to believe that and leave it at that. But if it is something else. Well, here I am. I know who I am and what I stand for. And I understand what this country stands for and I am staying put.”
The emails are part of a broader immigration strategy aimed at revoking visas, asylum, parole and temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants. A specialized immigration task force within the Department of Government Efficiency is providing the technical infrastructure to make that strategy a reality, according to reporting by Politico. 
Like other DOGE mass email campaigns, the emails Trujillo and others received incited panic and confusion, especially since immigration notices have historically been sent through U.S. mail and online government portals. Before DHS publicly acknowledged the emails many online wrote them off as a scam. 
The switch to email is a recent one, Trujillo said. But his case and that of other citizens who mistakenly received the email call into question the reliability of using email. 
Trujillo’s email — which he shared with The Utah Investigative Journalism Project — lists the sender as “automatedmessage@cbp.dhs.gov.” Because the message came from an unrecognized address, it triggered an anti-phishing warning from his Outlook email service.
CBP did not respond to questions about how it is ensuring the notices get to the correct recipients and how many emails it accidentally sent to citizens. Instead, the agency said in a statement that it had issued notices terminating parole for individuals who do not have lawful status to remain in the country. 
The statement clarified that those notices were not limited to just individuals who had used CBP One and that the notices do not currently apply to Ukrainian and Afghan immigrants with parole. 
“To be clear: If you are an alien, being in the United States is a privilege — not a right,” the statement reads. “We are acting in the best interest of the country and enforcing the law accordingly.”

‘It’s heartbreaking’ 
Trujillo has written off the email as a mistake. But many aren’t so lucky. 
Jesus — who The Utah Investigative Journalism Project is referring to by only his first name because he fears speaking out may impact his immigration case — received a letter late last month that terminated his parole and authorization to work in the U.S. Unlike Trujillo, Jesus is not a citizen. 
“It literally destroyed me,” Jesus said in Spanish, “Because I’ve tried to do things legally in the U.S.”
The letter, which was shared with The Utah Investigative Journalism Project, directed Jesus, a BYU computer science student, to leave the U.S. by April 24 or face “adverse immigration consequences.”











It's heartbreaking. You know, these people came the right way, applied the right way, lawfully and orderly, and they're leaving.


– Utah attorney Carlos Trujillo



Jesus applied for asylum in the U.S. after fleeing political persecution in Venezuela. He entered the country legally in November 2023 through the humanitarian parole program. The Trump administration recently ended the program, which had benefited 532,000 people from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua. That decision is currently being challenged in court. 
“The phones blew up here,” Trujillo said, adding that over 50 of his clients have gotten letters telling them to leave the country. They range from newly arrived immigrants to individuals who have been in the U.S. for close to a decade.
“It’s heartbreaking,” he said. “You know, these people came the right way, applied the right way, lawfully and orderly, and they’re leaving.”
Trujillo and Montes encouraged immigrants to pursue their case with an immigration attorney, get informed of their rights and be brave about standing up for themselves and their communities. 
“There’s never been a scarier time to step up and to push back against such a powerful entity like our federal administration, but there’s also never been a more important time to do so,” Montes said.
Jesus is currently working with his immigration lawyers to stay in the country, but he worries daily of both the consequences of returning to Venezuela as well as the possibility of being detained by U.S. immigration officers. 
“My worry is that I go back and the persecution against me starts again,” he said in Spanish. “They could literally kill me.” 
All of these developments hit close to home for Trujillo. When he became a citizen, he remembers finally feeling like he had made it, like he didn’t need to worry anymore. 
“As an immigrant, you always feel unstable,” he said. “Here I am, 15 years later, and I’m worried about it again.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate approved two bills Thursday aimed at enhancing online safety for minors by requiring filters on new smartphones and tablets and mandating age verification for app store access.
Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, the sponsor of the legislation, said on the Senate floor that the bills aim to prevent children from accessing potentially harmful content online.
“They try to protect children, the most vulnerable of our society … they do it in different ways, but it’s all about protecting children,” Chambliss said following the vote.

The first bill, SB 186, passed the chamber on a 28-5 vote. It would require that smartphones and tablets manufactured on or after June 1 and activated in Alabama include a pre-installed filter capable of blocking obscene material. During the device activation process, users will be asked their age and the filter will automatically be enabled if the user is identified as a minor who is under 18. Adults would be able to disable the filter using a password.
“We don’t even have to come up with a solution. It’s already there. It is already there. This bill is very simple. All it does is require those who manufacture these devices to turn the filter on if the device is enabled, activated for a child. That’s it in a nutshell,” he said on the Senate floor, adding that smartphones are already equipped with these filters.
The bill would allow parents or guardians to sue manufacturers for damages if a minor accesses obscene material due to non-compliance, and the Attorney General would also be able to pursue civil penalties against manufacturers.
The second bill, SB 187, which passed 26-6, would require app store to verify the age of individuals creating accounts in Alabama. The app store must obtain parental consent for users identified as minors before the minor can download or purchase apps or make in-app purchases. It would also prohibit developers from enforcing disclosures or terms of service on minors without parental consent.
“This is important because children, minors are not of an age and maturity and intellect to enter into these contracts, to read and understand these contracts. They’re hard enough for adults,” Chambliss said.
This legislation would require app store providers to share age category data with developers and notify parents of significant app changes, requiring renewed consent. The attorney general would have the right to pursue civil action for potentially deceptive trade practices, potentially leading to significant fines.
Chambliss said that similar legislation regarding app stores has advanced in other states, including one that was signed into law in Utah in March. Chambliss said that the Alabama bill was amended to align closely with Utah’s law.
“The point is to try to make it consistent across the states, and then, hopefully, when enough states adopt it, maybe Congress will adopt it, and we wouldn’t have a different law in every state,” Chambliss said.
Both bills move to the Alabama House of Representatives for consideration.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/04/21/health-officials-cut-inspection-backlog-of-nursing-homes-advocates-demand-more/,"Health officials say the state is making progress on reducing a significant backlog of nursing home inspections, with more than half of facilities having received an inspection within the last 16 months, but advocates worry that's not enough.","Advocates worry that some nursing homes have not been inspected in years, leaving seniors potentially exposed to unsafe living conditions. Stock.adobe.comHealth officials say the state is making progress on reducing a significant backlog of nursing home inspections, with more than half of facilities having received an inspection within the last 16 months.
But with some facilities being more than four years behind schedule for an inspection, advocates and lawmakers fear that some of Maryland’s seniors may be languishing in unsafe living conditions while the state works through its backlog.
“How do we hold owners of nursing homes accountable for the care in the places where these folks are staying?” asked Bruce Hartung, president of the Maryland Continuing Care Residents’ Association. “Without inspections, we simply have no idea how these folks are living — and in what conditions they are living.”
At issue is a years-old backlog of state inspections of the state’s 220 nursing homes as required by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The backlog has spanned administrations and was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
But Maryland ranks second to last in the nation when it comes to timely inspections of nursing homes, with average inspection lag of 2.44 years compared to the national average of 0.97 years, according to StarPro, which tracks data on nursing homes across the United States. Maryland falls behind only Alabama, which has an average lag of 3 years.
The state Department of Health has been struggling to catch up on those inspections since, with some facilities not receiving an annual inspection for four years or more, according to CMS data, though state officials note that the federal data may lag by a couple months.
Meanwhile, lawmakers and senior advocates worry that seniors could be facing unsafe living conditions without oversight or knowledge of state officials, and they passed legislation this session in hopes of keeping better tabs on the issue.
“These are the most vulnerable people in our population,” said Sen. Benjamin Kramer (D-Montgomery). “And nobody is putting eyes on the nursing home to ensure that these seniors are being properly cared for.”

Lawmakers passed Senate Bill 376, sponsored by Kramer, to boost the reporting requirements on the health department, so it will provide more frequent updates as it works through the inspection backlog.
Under SB376, which is currently on the governor’s desk, the department will need to start providing quarterly reports updating lawmakers on the progress of nursing home inspections throughout the state. The bill also prompts the Office of Health Care Quality to report to local jurisdictions every six months on the progress of inspections in their individual counties.
The nursing home inspection backlog was a hot topic throughout session.
Dr. Nilesh Kalyanaraman, deputy secretary for the health department on public health, told lawmakers that the agency is making progress on the backlog, though he admitted there is still work to be done.
He said during a January briefing on the issue for the Senate Finance Committee that the estimated time to “catch up” on inspections will take about two more years, as the department has needed to train staff to conduct the inspections. Each inspection can take about a week to conduct.
In written testimony on SB376, the health department reported that as of March 31, there were 130 nursing homes out of a total 220, or 59%, that had an annual inspection conducted in the previous 16 months, the maximum time allowed by federal guidelines.  That’s an improvement from June, when the rate of annual inspections conducted within 16 months was just 21.2%, according to the department’s testimony.
Hank Greenberg, AARP Maryland state director, said that uninspected nursing homes can result in lower quality of care for seniors, who may not have a strong support system to help advocate for themselves against mistreatment or even abuse.
“This can result in preventable injuries, a decline in overall resident well-being, and really contributes to the fact that their could be abuse and neglect that don’t rise as quickly as they should,” he said. “And keeps people from being able to know that things will be addressed.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A group of nursing home residents are already suing the Department of Health for neglect they allegedly experienced in living facilities, citing the backlog of nursing home inspections as a contributing factor to their experience.
The plaintiffs have mobility-related disabilities and rely on nursing staff for moving around the facility, eating, and personal hygiene. The lawsuit alleges that residents were often left unattended for extended periods, leaving them isolated from community events or sometimes left in soiled clothing for hours, among other concerns outlined in the lawsuit. The nursing homes cited in the lawsuit had not had an inspection in years, some as far back as 2020, according to the suit filed last year.
SB376 was amended throughout session, and Greenberg and Hartung would have preferred the original version of the bill, which would have allowed counties to sign a memorandum of understanding with the health department to take over on inspections for nursing homes, freeing up state resources to work on the remaining backlog.
The initial version of the bill was based on a previous agreement between Montgomery County and the state that expired in 2021, which allowed the county to keep up with timely inspections. The original language in SB376 would have allowed other counties to request the chance to do the same.
The department opposed that version of the bill, saying it would actually cost the state more money to let counties conduct inspections and would create other complications. Supporters of the legislation disagreed, but the bill went through a series of amendments before it was struck out during conference committee and rewritten to the new reporting requirements.
“When you can’t get the inspections done, what are your alternatives?” Hartung said. “It [reporting requirements] is a step forward … But we know that they’re not getting done, so the question is what kind of teeth will there be in that reporting?”
But both Hartung and Greenberg still believe that the new reporting requirements will help keep tabs on the department as it works through the backlog of nursing home inspections.

(Photo courtesy Santa Fe Public Schools)As New Mexico schools continue to grapple with more than 700 teacher vacancies, according to the most recent data, some districts have begun to rely on teachers licensed through the state’s alternative licensing programs, which provide licensure pathways for people with degrees in areas outside of education.
For instance, Hatch Valley Public Schools Superintendent Michael Chavez told Source NM about one third of the teachers the district employs are non-traditional teachers and because of this, the district does not deal with teacher vacancies to the same extent as other districts.
According to the 2024 New Mexico Educator Vacancy Report released in October, there were 737 teacher vacancies last year, 34% of which were special education teacher positions and 24% were elementary positions. The vacancy rate showed a slight improvement over 2023 by 14 positions.
When asked for the total number of current teachers licensed through an alternative program, a Public Education Department spokesperson pointed to the same report, which noted that more than 1,100 students completed a teacher preparation program at a New Mexico school last year and more than half of those students were enrolled in an alternative program.
These teachers are “highly qualified” and bring years of professional experience in their field to the classroom, Chavez said. However, he noted, they are still learning how to be teachers. This is why professional work hours are so important, for teachers from all pathways and experience. 
“One of the things that I’ve been really pushing on since we came out of COVID is we need to build the capacity of our teachers,” Chavez said. But finding the time with 180 days of instruction — a number set by the state Public Education Department in a March 2024 rule and currently in litigation — is challenging, he said. “What we need is more time…for professional development with teachers so we can develop them and build their capacity in learning how to become an effective teacher.”
New Mexico’s current Public School Code allows middle and high school teachers to use 30 hours of instructional time for parent-teacher meetings, professional development and mentorship, while elementary teachers can use up to 60 hours. These standards were established in 2023 through House Bill 130, which also set a required 1,140 instructional hours per school year. The maximum professional work hours allowed previously were even fewer.
When the Public Education Department subsequently created its rule requiring 180 instructional days per calendar year, it also included a stipulation that professional work hours be completed before school, after school or on a day outside of the required minimum, so as to not detract from students’ instructional time. 
That component of the rule also faces opposition.
Whitney Holland, president of American Federation of Teachers’ New Mexico chapter, told Source NM that there are “more than enough opportunities to accommodate” professional development during regular school time and that her organization is “going to hold the line” against the PED’s rule.
Holland told Source that AFT-NM always advocates for more professional development time and an alignment between primary and secondary teachers’ allowed hours.
“I think the most valuable time I had as professional development as a teacher was that time where I could collaborate with my peers and even go into their classrooms and see what they’re doing,” Holland said. 
She said she has some concern over alternative licensed teachers filling so many teacher vacancies because teaching is often their second career and AFT wants to make sure “we’re investing in people who are going to stay in their communities and stay in their field,” but “at the end of the day, I’ve worked with a ton of [alternative] licensed teachers who have been super capable. They bring a lot to the table.”
Holland said she would rather have alternative licensed teachers fill vacancies than long-term substitutes, so long as there are “some” individuals in classrooms with traditional licensure through the PED.
House Bill 238, introduced during this year’s legislative session, would have amended the Public School Code to allow all levels of teachers K-12 up to 60 hours of professional work hours. The House of Representatives unanimously passed the bill, but it eventually died in the Senate Finance Committee.
Holland said she will continue advocating for teachers to have more professional work hours going forward because “we are looking at a holistic model of what pieces of education need to change and I think looking at that traditional school year, school day is part of that,” she said. “It’s not going to be one fix. It’s going to have to be a whole bunch of different things.”

Garrett sponsored last year's CHOOSE Act, which gives families tax credits of $7,000 for each eligible child to be spent on nonpublic education. Orr recently increased funding for the program in the 2026 budget. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Our leaders call Alabama’s effective voucher program the CHOOSE Act. There’s some grim irony in that.
Of course, you can choose to pay for private school tuition, whatever your reasons may be.
But it’s not my choice. Or what the families of 730,000 Alabama students want. We pay taxes to support the teachers educating our children in public schools. And we want teachers and staff to have the resources they need to help students thrive.
Yet our leaders plan to divert that money from classrooms into the pockets of wealthy families, in the form of $7,000 tax breaks. More if they have more than one kid enrolled in a private school.
Yes, yes. Under this law, the credit could cover something besides a non-public academy. But considering that two-thirds of the initial applicants to the program are already in private school or homeschooled, it’s not hard to predict how the program will operate.
You might also note current eligibility is limited to those making 300% of the poverty level. That sounds a lot more restrictive than it is.
The cap is almost $80,000 a year for a family of three and around $96,000 for a family of four. Alabama’s median household income is $62,212 a year. So we’re already letting those making more than half the households in the state into the program.
That mild regulation goes away in 2027. Which means the 1% will get in. And that you will be paying private school tuition for people who don’t need the help.
That’s not how one sells a voucher program. Instead, you preach “choice” to families and educators locked in a public education system built on discrimination.
“The CHOOSE Act will provide an opportunity for students to learn and thrive in an environment that best meets their needs, which could be a public school,” said Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the sponsor of the law, during House debate last year.
Even U.S. Sen. Katie Britt gets into it, claiming that her own federal version of this is OK because “your zip code shouldn’t determine your opportunities.”
Nor should dead racists, the main reason why some zip codes have a lot more opportunity than others. But even if we accept Garrett and Britt’s premises, the CHOOSE Act isn’t going to help poor kids. Seven thousand dollars won’t get a student struggling with poverty to a private school. Not when the average private school tuition in Alabama is $8,298 a year.
One gets an image of a person in an Armani suit walking into a cell block and proclaiming freedom to the inmates while holding a $7,000 check in one hand and a $8,298 key in the other.
Freeing our schools from the prison of Jim Crow means trusting local communities with school funding; ending tax breaks to elite Alabamians that drain public services and spending money on students.
The CHOOSE Act sort of acknowledges that. Implicit in the law is the premise that any private school in Alabama is superior to any public school.
Why?
Because many private schools invest far more money in their students than the $13,461 per pupil our state does, a number that would be even lower without the 18% the federal government kicks in. Altamont in Birmingham charges over $30,000 a year for high school. Montgomery Academy asks for $19,000 for students in grades 10-12.
Just think what we could achieve if Alabama spent $30,000 a year on a public school student. Or $24,000, which gets Massachusetts nation-leading results on standardized tests. Or $17,277, the average per-pupil spending in the United States.
The CHOOSE Act has to nod at the fact that school spending works. But it also operates within the worldview of a state government that promotes private privilege over public welfare. Money can only go to people who already have it. Not the undeserving poor.
And a lot of that money is about to head out the door. The 2026 education budget originally included $100 million to fund the CHOOSE Act. Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, the chair of the Senate’s education budget committee, increased that to $135 million due to “overwhelming, large applicant numbers” for the program.
Expect that number to grow even more as the caps come off the program. Public school funding will suffer. Arizona in 2022 expanded an existing voucher program along the lines of what Alabama has just implemented. It proved far more expensive than they anticipated, and it’s contributed to budget problems in the state. That could happen here, and public school students will pay the price.
The key to public school improvement is obvious: collecting more taxes from the wealthy — who pay less to the state government in percentage terms than the poorest 20% — and investing them in public education. Making the system better for everyone.
But Alabama legislators have signaled they’d much rather assist children who don’t need the help.
The rest of us have no choice in that.

“With the Women’s CARE Act, we focus on providing appropriate care for those who are pregnant at the time of arrest or detention, emphasizing the deferment of time served rather than complete exemption from sentencing,” Hollis told members of the House Judiciary Committee during its April 9 meeting.
Hollis introduced nearly identical legislation in 2024 and managed to get it approved in the House Judiciary Committee with roughly the same number of days left in the session as this year. However, it failed to get consideration on the House floor.
The bill states that a woman who is pregnant or thinks she is pregnant will have the option of taking a pregnancy test. If a woman is pregnant, the test result will be reported to the court and the county health department.
She will then be released on bail during the court proceedings. If the court sentences her to be incarcerated, she will then be sentenced to supervised probation up to12 weeks after she gives birth to the child, with the time she served while on probation getting credited toward her sentence.
Any fines, fees and restitution she owes will be suspended while she is serving pre-incarceration probation.
After that time, the individual will surrender to the Alabama Department of Corrections, the county or municipal jail, or be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $6,000 fine.
A woman must report the loss of a pregnancy to the court within 72 hours while she is serving probation prior to getting incarcerated, and the court will determine when she begins her incarceration.
“I have spoken with many women who have experienced this nightmare, and did not get the proper medical attention that they should get,” Hollis said.

(Photo: Getty Images)Every time I go to work, I carry a radio, a rulebook, and the weight of knowing one mistake could cost someone their life. After more than 20 years working as a conductor for Union Pacific Railroad, I’ve learned this job isn’t just about moving freight. It’s about coming home safe and making sure everyone else does, too. That’s why I support Assembly Bill 446. 
This bill isn’t an overreach. It’s not some abstract regulation dreamed up in a government office. It’s a reflection of what rail workers see and face every single day: blocked crossings that delay ambulances and fire crews, pitch-black yards where visibility is next to nothing, and trains so long they take twenty minutes to clear an intersection—if they clear it at all. These aren’t rare occurrences. This is daily life on the railroad. And it shouldn’t take a tragedy to decide it’s time to do better. 
Assembly Bill 446 is a common-sense proposal rooted in firsthand experience. It puts basic safeguards in place, like requiring proper lighting in rail yards so workers aren’t fumbling in the dark with heavy equipment. It sets standards to prevent multiple mile-long trains from cutting off emergency services and splitting communities for hours. It addresses safety concerns with defect detectors, the trackside devices that flag potential failures, by ensuring their data isn’t kept hidden when something goes wrong. And it provides oversight over contract carriers who move rail crews to and from trains, because those folks deserve to get home safe too. 
Critics will say this bill is unnecessary. That the railroads already follow federal rules and can police themselves. But ask the workers on the ground. Ask the folks in Caliente, Carlin, or Sparks who’ve watched crossings stay blocked while help sits on the wrong side of the tracks. Congressman Mark Amodei, a Republican, recently raised concerns about these very issues in his own district. This isn’t a union-versus-corporation fight. It’s about public safety, and it affects us all. 
We’ve seen what happens when railroads are left to set their own limits. In the past decade, the major carriers have pushed longer and heavier trains onto the rails under a model called Precision Scheduled Railroading. It was designed not for safety or efficiency but for Wall Street. The result? Skeleton crews, overloaded trains, and delayed response times when emergencies strike. Safety has become a cost to cut, not a value to protect. 
No one is saying railroads aren’t vital. They are. They move goods across this country every day and are the backbone of our economy. But with that responsibility comes the obligation to do it safely and to serve the communities they run through. Not just the shareholders they report to. 
Some lobbyists will argue that state laws like AB 446 interfere with federal regulation. What they don’t say is that many of these same companies have spent years lobbying against national safety standards. They’ve defeated efforts to regulate train length, mandate two-person crews, or require timely data sharing on safety devices. And now, when states like Nevada step up to fill the gap, they cry foul.
If we wait for Washington to solve this, we’ll be waiting a long time. States have every right, and I would argue a duty, to protect their citizens when federal action falls short. AB 446 doesn’t replace federal law. It complements it by addressing the unique challenges our state faces, from remote rural towns to rapidly growing urban areas. 
In the railroad industry, we often say that safety is no accident. But it can’t just be a slogan. It has to be a commitment backed by policy, training, investment, and yes, regulation. Because when things go wrong on the railroad, they go wrong fast and with consequences that ripple far beyond the tracks. 
I don’t write this as a politician or a lobbyist. I write it as someone who’s walked the ballast in extreme weather conditions. As someone who’s crawled under rail cars in the dead of night. And as someone who’s had to explain to new hires that they’ll be riding in clunky passenger 
vans on icy roads for 12 hours, because there’s no law saying their safety has to be taken seriously. 
AB 446 is a step toward changing that. It says we see you, we hear you, and we’re going to do better. For the workers, yes. But also for the parents stuck behind blocked crossings, for the paramedics trying to save a life, and for the next generation who deserves to grow up in a state where safety isn’t optional. 
It’s not radical. It’s responsible. And it’s long overdue. 
At the end of the day, this bill isn’t just about trains. It’s about people.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/railroad-sign-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 08:06:19.384949

(File photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).In what many are calling an astonishing dereliction of duty, the Maryland Senate’s Judicial Proceeding Committee (JPR) failed to move “Good-Cause” eviction legislation forward. Despite unprecedented statewide support, including a 96-37 vote in the House last year, JPR allowed amendments pushed by the landlord/developer (LL/D) industry tying the legislation to rent stabilization laws, and weakening good-cause standards, letting landlords arbitrarily and unjustly evict renters from their homes.
The committee’s first amendment would have required rent stabilization programs across Maryland to drop vacancy control from apartment homes. Vacancy control maintains rent levels for apartments when a tenant moves out. Vacancy decontrol lets rent float up to market rates, often to levels new tenants cannot afford. Affordable housing advocates adamantly oppose decontrol, pointing to the further loss of reasonably priced housing stocks.
The second series of amendments would have knocked the teeth out of the good causes that would be required to justify nonrenewal of leases and the eventual eviction of a tenant who stays longer than the lease term, known as Tenant Holding Over (THO). Including minor violations of a lease or community rules, for example, as a justification to evict turns on its head the very principle of establishing a stated, substantial violation to justify forcing someone from their home.

Consensus has been building for decades that stable, quality homes are central determinants of community health, welfare and prosperity. The idea that a rental apartment is a mere “unit” no different than any commodity, like craft beer or concert tickets, has faded as the relationship of stable, quality housing to social welfare and prosperity has changed.
Nearly 40% of Maryland residents now live in rental housing not as a station on the way to owning, but as permanent housing. It is no longer acceptable to destabilize whole communities with unpredictable and excessive rent increases that rely entirely on market potential, or to evict without good reason, without considering the social and economic costs to tenants and our communities.
At least that’s what we thought …
But alongside modern thinking on housing policy that promotes affordability, and legislation to ensure stability, a counter narrative promoted by the rental housing industry and its well-financed network of lobbyists and bloggers has spawned, citing cherry-picked and distorted data.
The narrative goes like this: Things like good-cause protections, rent stabilization or stronger code and rights enforcement might sound nice to uneducated renters and their advocates, but they don’t really need them. What they really need is investment in building more housing so that market competition will eliminate the lack of affordability and disincentivize bad landlord behavior.
They define the housing crisis solely as a “shortage,” citing market demand for housing while ignoring the instability of existing residents’ housing, and conveniently omitting discussion around when or how that demand might be met in specific markets. They say all we need to do is “build our way out of the crisis.”
Industry-friendly bloggers cite the building boom of the Sun Belt and how housing prices there have come down, not mentioning high vacancy rates and low demand in some of those cities. They cite the St. Paul, Minnesota, sample where new multifamily building slowed after rent stabilization passed — but fail to mention how, when the city went back and exempted new development long enough for investors to recoup their investment and make a profit, investment in multifamily housing continued at its hurried pace.
Closer to home, the LL/D bloggers cite the lack of building in Takoma Park, citing rent stabilization as the cause.  They don’t mention the lack of land availability in Takoma Park, now understood to be a built-out community.
Housing codes and renter protections were introduced decades ago to put an end to the squalor, instability and abuse past generations of tenants endured. Teachers, police, nurses, retail workers, immigrants, young families and now, an increasing number of senior citizens are no longer able to purchase a home in a housing market that places home ownership well out of their reach.
Marylanders must ask why Senate Judicial Proceedings Chair Will Smith (D-Montgomery) and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) would give deference to these fallacious industry narratives that set up a false choice between renter protections and building more housing, rather than using every tool at their disposal to get this done for constituents demanding action — and facts.
More than 5,000 Marylanders were evicted last year for THO, likely a tip-of-the-iceberg figure as it does not count those who move before going to court. Until our elected officials press them on just what that means, we will continue to see whole renter communities destabilized, while anger grows at those elected to represent them who failed to act.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_feb18_renterrally_goodcause-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-21 08:06:19.384949

Ned Lamont is championing a plan that would offer free or reduced-price pre-K education to scores of CT families. Here's what to know.,"Gov. Ned Lamont is championing a plan that would offer free or reduced-price pre-K education to scores of Connecticut families. The plan is one of several bills that lawmakers are considering to improve access to early childhood education.
The issue has a lot of support from lawmakers, parents, advocates and members of the business community. That’s in part because the COVID-19 pandemic brought the urgent need for child care into focus for many, including Lamont, and became the catalyst for him to create a Blue Ribbon Panel to study the issue. But paying for more families to access child care spots and improving salaries for workers in the sector is an expensive proposition.
Here’s what to know. 
Would my family qualify for pre-K under the governor’s plan? 
It depends on your household income. Families making up to $100,000 a year would pay nothing for pre-K. Families making up to $150,000 a year would pay just $20 a day. But households earning more than $150,000 a year would still pay out of pocket for pre-K, unless they have access to schools in a district that offers spots, like New Haven and Hartford. 
What would the governor’s plan do for infant and toddler care? 
Currently, the governor’s plan does not cover infant and toddler care, only children ages 3 to 5. While advocates say infant and toddler care is critically important for Connecticut families, especially to help companies fill more than 90,000 vacancies across the state, many still support Lamont’s plan because they say it represents a major step in the right direction.
Plus, advocates say, Lamont’s plan would maintain the integrity of the infant and toddler system that currently exists by improving salaries for workers in child care centers while building capacity and spots in public schools.
How would I enroll my children in pre-K under Lamont’s plan?
Lawmakers envision a new portal that would provide easily accessible information for parents to quickly see all of the pre-K options available to them. There are currently bills under consideration that propose this solution, including House Bill 5003, a more comprehensive plan to support early childhood care, and House Bill 7044, which focuses on the creation of the online portal.
When would these additional pre-K slots be available?
Office of Early Childhood Commissioner Beth Bye says that a significant number of new subsidized pre-K spots would be added by 2028 and that by 2032 the vast majority of Connecticut’s pre-K population would have access. Those spots would be spread across child care centers, public schools, group child care homes and family child care homes.
How would Connecticut pay for all these new spots? 
Under Lamont’s plan, up to $300 million in surplus funds would be directed to a Universal Preschool Endowment Fund. Of that, $30 million could be spent in the next fiscal year, with 10% of the endowment eligible for spending each year thereafter. In his budget address, Lamont optimistically told lawmakers, “our budget anticipates almost $1 billion in the endowment over the next few years — God, the economy, and President Trump willing.” 
What other plans are on the table? 
Lawmakers are also considering other plans for pre-K.  Senate Bill 1 would involve a four phase approach that would eventually build toward covering not only pre-K but infant and toddler care as well, and similar to Lamont’s proposal, it would rely on surplus funds. The first phase of that proposal would call for a “tri-share” model in which businesses would be asked to contribute to the cost of child care for their employees, but participation would be voluntary. Another plan, House Bill 5003, seeks to allow more households to qualify for Care4Kids, would expand the child care subsidy fund, provide support to child care workers and help with renovations to child care facilities. And Senate Bill 1369 would provide financial assistance for working families to pay for child care through a new 1.5% payroll tax on large, for-profit employers.
Why has this issue become a priority? 
During the COVID pandemic, the issue of access to affordable, quality child care came to the forefront. Suddenly, medical workers and other essential workers across Connecticut were left without child care. Advocate Eva Bermúdez Zimmerman said COVID “created a dystopian reality” where workers were quitting left and right because child care was simply unavailable and the necessity of child care to the survival of the workforce was suddenly glaring.
In 2023, Lamont created a Blue Ribbon Panel to study child care. The bill being considered by lawmakers is a result of the panel’s report, which found that the sector was struggling with many problems simultaneously, from low-wages for child care workers and pre-K teachers, to the lack of transportation in some rural regions, to limited hours in public school programs that made it impossible for parents to work and make pick-ups and drop-offs. The governor’s plan intends to address all of these issues.
With so many federal cuts, will there really be enough money in the state budget? 
That question can’t really be answered yet. With significant federal cuts to all kinds of programs, from libraries and museums to support services for the unhoused, to threats to Medicaid and Medicare, it’ stands to reason’s possible that the kinds of surpluses envisioned when the plan was drafted may not be available.
It’s notable that Lamont has stood by the plan despite all of the upheaval in recent months. Asked at The Connecticut Mirror’s In the Room event, featuring a sit-down interview with the governor on March 26, about what problem he would fix in the state if he could fix anything, Lamont brought up education, specifically early childhood.

(Courtesy of the New Jersey Governor’s Office)Attorneys representing a group of New Jersey parents and activist groups are asking a state appellate court to weigh in on a case that could reshape the state’s public education system.
At the center of the fight is whether New Jersey schools are unconstitutionally segregated by race and socioeconomic status. A lower court judge in October 2023 acknowledged the state’s public schools are segregated by race and that the state must act, but also found that the plaintiffs had failed to prove the entire system is segregated across all its districts.
The parents’ attorneys filed a motion last week with the state’s appellate division asking it to hear the case.
“It is imperative that no more students be deprived of these rights by the trial court’s avoidance of the straightforward conclusion compelled by the facts and the law in this case — that the state defendants, who are legally obligated to take action to desegregate public schools regardless of the reasons for that segregation, have acted unconstitutionally by failing to do so,” the attorneys wrote in the filing.
Gov. Phil Murphy and the state Department of Education have until April 28 to respond to the plaintiffs’ new filing. A spokesman for the Murphy administration declined to comment. 
News of the new filing was first reported by Chalkbeat Newark.
The case dates to 2018, when the Latino Action Network, the NAACP New Jersey State Conference, and several other families and groups sued the state alleging New Jersey failed to address de facto segregation in public schools. The plaintiffs cited data showing that nearly half of all Black and Latino students in New Jersey attend schools that are more than 90% non-white, in districts that are often just blocks from predominantly white districts. 
In New Jersey, students typically attend schools in the municipality where they live. Plaintiffs argued that long-standing housing policies that led to segregated residential neighborhoods led to segregated schools also. New Jersey is the seventh-most segregated state for Black and Latino students, the plaintiffs say.
In October 2023, after Superior Court Judge Robert Lougy issued his ruling that acknowledged racial segregation in New Jersey schools but said it was not widespread, both sides entered mediation talks in hopes it would resolve more quickly than continued litigation.
Attorneys for the parties said in February that it’s unlikely continuing the talks would “be constructive.”
The plaintiffs’ attorneys say the lower court’s October ruling should be reversed. They want a judge to review what they say are six errors in the 2023 order, like the fact that Lougy did not identify a disputed fact. 
“Rather than reach the only logical conclusion that followed — that the state defendants violated plaintiffs’ constitutional rights — the trial court left the question of liability for another day,” the filing reads.
If the appellate court denies the motion, the case would return to the trial court, or could be appealed to the state Supreme Court.

Cuts to U.S. Department of Agriculture food assistance programs could hit local farmers, food banks and their users at a time when more families are reliant on them.
Northwest Harvest CEO Thomas Reynolds has been tracking the situation closely.
Northwest Harvest is a statewide nonprofit that distributes goods to most food banks in Yakima County, and has 400 partners across the state. Since 2023, it has operated the Fruitvale Community Market in Yakima, a food pantry modeled after a grocery store and one of the largest food banks in the state.
Lately, the lines at Fruitvale Community Market have been much longer than usual, Reynolds told the Yakima Herald-Republic. The food bank is open three days a week. Last summer, it served about 750 households on the days it was open, a number that’s now grown to 1,300 households.
“That’s a really strong indicator that household budgets are being constrained by the increased cost of rent, of fuel, of food and of health care,” Reynolds said.
The federal funding situation is changing each day, he said.
“It’s just a dynamic situation right now,” Reynolds said. He does not believe a complete federal cut would happen, as too many constituents rely on these programs.
If there was a complete cut, “every food bank overnight would have to quadruple what they’re doing just to meet the gap,” he said.
Reynolds said Northwest Harvest is preparing for a wide range of scenarios. While the organization does not rely on federal funding to operate, many of its partners do. Northwest Harvest depends on donations of money and food, and has some state support.
 Farmers and harvest

Adding to the situation, and his worries, are concerns about potential labor shortages during the upcoming harvest season and tariffs impacting farmers’ bottom line, which might lower produce donations to Northwest Harvest.
Northwest Harvest has increased its budget for purchasing food in case less food is donated, he said.
“The growers, the orchardists, the ranchers in the Yakima Valley are some of the most generous people in Washington state,” Reynolds said.
About 70% of the foods the organization distributes across the state are fruits and vegetables, most of which are grown near Yakima, he said. It also receives local beef, dairy, eggs and will trade some of its apples for other in-demand goods it can’t get locally, like citrus fruit.
He’s also concerned about how the terminations of USDA research positions might impact the future of American agriculture.
 Senator’s perspective

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat who represents Washington state, lambasted the Trump administration for funding cuts in a news conference on April 10. She said $1.6 billion in funds that help food banks, public school students and local farmers have been cut nationwide.
The USDA’s Local Food for Schools program awards funds to schools to buy local produce; the Local Food Purchase Assistance program helps states, tribes and territories buy local food for food banks; and the Emergency Food Assistance Program provides food assistance to people with low incomes.
All are facing cuts. Around $25 million would have gone to Washington state alone, she said.
“Right now, some of the richest and most powerful men in the world are stealing food from our kids,” Murray said.
Joining Murray was Cal Coblentz, CEO of Partners Inland Northwest, a food bank in Spokane. Coblentz said that at least a quarter of households in Washington need some kind of food assistance, according to studies by the state Department of Agriculture.
That increased from just one in seven in 2021, he said. In some areas, up to 70% of households with children might need food assistance.
So far, 23 school districts have withdrawn from the Local Food from Schools program because they don’t have money in their budgets to make up for the federal funding shortfall, according to Murray’s office. The program helps get fresh food to around 850,000 students in Washington state, the senator said.
 On the farm

The Local Food Purchase Assistance program and the Emergency Food Assistance Program also saw cuts of $500 million each nationwide, she said. USDA Farm to School grants also were canceled, which help food purchasing programs as well as field trips and school gardens.
“These programs support American farmers by buying their products,” Murray said.
Cutting the programs hurt the domestic market at a time when the international market is in flux with proposed tariffs, she said.
“It’s almost as if their plan is to hammer farmers as hard as they can,” Murray said.
Haley Olsen-Wailand, a farmer who grows organic vegetables on the Olympic Peninsula, said last year was the best year financially in her family’s 22 years of growing. But now, she has major concerns about the future with the federal cuts.
She said just under 20% of her farm’s gross sales came from sales to food banks, spurred directly by Local Food Purchase Assistance program funds, she said.
A grocery store might not want curved cucumbers, but food banks will buy them.
“As a farmer, having a market for secondary vegetables and fruits is very valuable,” she said.
Local schools were starting to make more meals from scratch using local produce because of the programs.
“We were excited by the idea that we had an expanding local market,” she said. “In our industry, new markets are few and far between.”
Now she’s not as confident.
“We put these seeds in the ground, and it’s months before we harvest them. We need to know where they are going, she said. “Losing these markets is a really big blow to us right as our costs are rising.”

(Courtesy photo)We often mark life’s joyful milestones — birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries — with celebrations because they signal new beginnings. But beyond the cake and presents, what truly makes these moments special is sharing them with others. The same is true in communities with problem-solving courts where each graduation is more than an individual achievement; it is a victory for the entire community.
Indiana has 140 certified problem-solving courts across 61 counties, operated by 94 judges working alongside prosecutors, attorneys, case managers, and service providers. These courts tackle the underlying causes of criminal behavior — including substance abuse, mental health struggles, and family instability — through a rigorous, evidence-based approach.
Participants commit to intensive services, frequent court appearances, weekly meetings, and drug screenings. Our problem-solving courts are not a shortcut to leniency; they demand accountability and sustained effort. Indeed, success is neither easy nor guaranteed, and graduation can take years. But when participants reach that milestone, the sense of accomplishment and hope is profound. Having attended many problem-solving court graduations myself, I assure you that the overwhelming joy and aspiration is indescribable.
And the effectiveness of these courts is well documented. A 2023 independent study by Temple University found that 93% of our problem-solving court graduates were not rearrested. With more than 250,000 new criminal cases filed in Indiana each year, we count on our judges to make firm, fair sentencing decisions to protect public safety while honoring the constitutional mandate of reform. In 1816, our founders made it clear through the Indiana Constitution — now embedded in Article 1, Section 18 — that our state’s criminal justice system promises reformation, not vindictive justice.
Problem-solving courts embody this principle, offering a structured path to lasting change.
Chief Justice Rush highlights ways judicial system is working to improve the lives of Hoosiers

Nationally, the criminal justice system has become a primary source of referrals to treatment. Our problem-solving courts offer a proven path to rehabilitation. The Indiana Supreme Court’s Office of Court Services certifies these courts to ensure that they comply with all applicable court, state, and federal regulations.
They are designed to help veterans get stable housing, a person in recovery to get job training, and parents to catch up on child support. And success for problem-court participants includes life-changing accomplishments, such as marking sobriety, reconnecting with family, earning a diploma, getting a driver’s license, depositing a hard-earned paycheck, or moving into a new home.
These are the types of triumphs that can cause a ripple effect for an entire community.
The state has limited resources, so it is unquestionably wise to use them in areas that have demonstrated long-term value to our communities. Investing in problem-solving courts is about allocating resources efficiently and effectively. And the results speak for themselves.
Our problem-solving court data shows thousands of graduates and hundreds of thousands of negative drug screens. But the real return on investment is not a number, and it is not quantifiable with a metric—it is the countless lives reclaimed.
Indiana’s problem-solving courts exemplify all that is good in our judicial system; justice tempered with mercy and based on principles of reformation required by the Indiana Constitution. They improve individual outcomes, provide a pathway for children to be safely reunited with their parents, and contribute to safer communities.
So, as you celebrate events this spring, consider attending a problem-solving court graduation in your community. Witness firsthand the transformation, the perseverance, and the second chances these courts provide. If your community doesn’t have a problem-solving court now, they hopefully will soon, as nearly 20 are in the planning stages.
And as we continue to expand these courts, more Hoosiers will have the opportunity to turn their lives around — one joyful milestone at a time.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana lawmakers have just a week to close a staggering $2 billion hole in the state’s next two-year spending plan — plus, bridge disagreements over publicly funded vouchers to private schools, regulations on marijuana-like products and school board elections.
The General Assembly aims to finish its work this week, but technically has until a statutory April 29 deadline to wrap up.
“Our job, one more important than any other legislation that we pass, is to make sure we pass a budget that is balanced and done so with integrity and not gimmicks,” Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray told reporters Thursday. “So, it’s going to be hard to do now, but we’re going to get it done.”
The budget, contained in House Bill 1001, is typically the last to cross the legislative finish line. But a crushing revenue forecast last week complicated an already formidable task.
The anticipated shortfall creates a “major” challenge, Bray said, and puts “everything” on the table when it comes to cuts and revenue generators. 
“They’re working through the line items. I think the thing that we want to protect and hold to the longest is trying to protect K-12,” House Speaker Todd Huston told reporters.

Both GOP leaders acknowledged that’ll be a challenge. K-12 is 47% of the budget.
Asked how he’d justify a universal expansion of a “school choice” voucher program amid cuts, Huston replied, “I can justify that we fund students in the state of Indiana. We don’t fund systems. So that’s the way our caucus has always approached it.” 
The voucher expansion would allow wealthy Hoosiers of all income levels to send their children to private school on a state-paid voucher. Right now the cap is 400% of the amount required for a student to qualify for the federal free or reduced price lunch program, equal to about $220,000.
House Republicans put the expansion into their version of the budget, but the Senate GOP stripped it out even before the rough financial news. Democrats in both chambers have long decried the spending of taxpayer dollars on private schooling.
“They’re very important to some people in our caucus, the House as well,” Bray acknowledged. “And so, the idea of having vouchers is certainly a viable option, but we’re going to have to figure out how to pay for it if that’s the case.”
  House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta answers reporter questions on Thursday, April 17, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Skipping the expansion is among Democrats’ first choices for cuts.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta assailed the voucher program as “irresponsible spending,” adding, “I mean, we’re almost approaching, now, a billion dollars there.”
Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder also suggested holding off on scheduled income tax cuts, which Bray said was “certainly … on the table.”
But cutting expenses isn’t the only way to plug the anticipated hole in state finances.
Cigarette tax hikes and more under consideration
Indiana’s sobering fiscal outlook may soften the Senate’s traditionally hostile stance against a long-sought increase in the cigarette tax. But is it enough?
The current rate of 99.5 cents per pack has gone unchanged since 2007. A $2 increase could bring in $318 million in new revenue annually, and bring down the state’s high smoking rate.
“Our caucus was slightly more amenable to that than they have been in the past, primarily because of the challenge that Medicaid has created for us,” Bray said.
The House has voted to approve cigarette tax hikes multiple times but Bray indicated his caucus’ resistance hasn’t totally waned.
“That’s still on the table, but it’s not at all going to be the first thing we look at,” he said.
Yoder, his Democratic counterpart, additionally suggested pursuing a managed care assessment fee. If fully implemented, the fee could bring the state $1 billion a year.
“We should be doing this (to) our managed care entities, the insurance companies who are making money off of our Pathways (to Aging program) patients,” she said. “We should be looking there.”
But it would require federal approval. Mitch Roob, who helms the agency overseeing Indiana’s Medicaid program, has expressed doubt that President Donald Trump’s administration would allow the Hoosier state to max it out.

And despite repeated assurances from leaders that “everything is on the table,” Huston was clear that one thing isn’t: marijuana legalization.
“We’re not going to legalize marijuana in the budget,” he said. He similarly batted away questions about gambling industry expansions.
“Significant public policy things shouldn’t be considered just because you have a revenue shortfall,” Huston told reporters.
Democrats, however, maintain conditions are ripe for a “serious conversation” about the drug.
Regulations for already-available, marijuana-like substances — and an accompanying excise tax — are still up for consideration, but face an uncertain path amid plenty of Senate skepticism.
Marijuana-lite tax could boost revenue, if lawmakers let it
Products with legally low concentrations of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol have proliferated in Indiana, alongside those containing delta-8 THC and other isomers. Past attempts to regulate the nascent industry, which is booming on shaky legal footing, have failed repeatedly. 
Senate Bill 478 is the furthest lawmakers have gotten. But it needs to survive closed-door negotiations — despite its sponsor’s attempts to avoid them — before it can cross Braun’s desk.
The measure would task the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission with overseeing the industry, including approving up to 20,000 retail permits. It sets out advertising, age-limit, licensing, packaging, testing and other requirements over the currently unregulated substances; an excise tax was removed because new taxes must go into House-originated legislation.
The revenue-generating provision is expected to find a new home.
 
Medicaid is expected to be about 20% of the budget. Because it’s an entitlement program — in which anyone who meets eligibility requirements has the right to enroll — states have limited power to cut costs.


“If it works its way through the process, I do think there’ll be an excise tax on it,” Huston told reporters. He was optimistic, citing “robust discussion” across three House committee hearings.
“There’s (been) a lot of discussion about where we are on the legalization, or, excuse me, the regulation of those products,” he concluded.
His Senate counterpart was more skeptical.
“We’re not gonna do a delta-8 bill to chase revenue. At all. That’s not the policy that we’re trying to pursue,” Bray said. “If we can find a way forward with that bill, then we will.”
Despite a whopping seven rounds of edits, critics still say the language would expand existing loopholes and legalize overly potent drugs.
“The way that it moved out of the House is not acceptable to the Senate,” Bray said. 
Lawmakers are still working on a compromise, but commented, “I have no ability to tell you that that’ll pass the finish line.”
‘Razor-thin’ margins expected for partisan school board compromise
Disagreements between House and Senate Republicans could sink another contentious measure — years in the making — adding political party affiliations to Indiana’s currently nonpartisan school board elections.
Senate Bill 287 originally would’ve required school board candidates to run in partisan primary elections. But, last month, House lawmakers changed it. Now it carries resurrected language requiring partisan designations only on the general election ballot. 
The Senate dissented to the changes, teeing up negotiations.

“(It’s the) same idea, but fairly dramatic changes,” Bray said. “… We’ve got members that are trying to work through that, to see if they can find a path forward that both the House and Senate can accept. I don’t think they’re there yet, but they’re still working on it.”
A Thursday conference committee hearing — when lawmakers usually provide short updates on negotiations or outline their compromises — was cancelled, then rescheduled for Monday.
“We’re still in conversations on how it’s going to go,” Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, told the Capital Chronicle. He sponsored the Senate bill, and authored the dead House bill.
But, he added, “I think the final version will still look a lot like how it left the House.”
Gaining Senate support could be a challenge, however.
In its original form, the legislation squeaked through the Senate on a 26-20 vote in February. The House, which has historically been friendlier to the concept of partisan school boards, approved the overhauled version with greater leeway in a 54-40 tally last month.
Asked if he’d have enough votes, Bray replied, “You know, that’s a razor-thin margin. So I do not have the answer for your question.”

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks, and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel, and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level, and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– amir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields, and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes, and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care, and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology, and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says, New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is before the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Washington’s top commerce official says the state cannot shield its economy from the fallout of rapidly escalating tariffs, particularly in sectors like agriculture, aerospace and technology.
“There is no way in Washington state that we can cover the gap for a global tariff trade war,” said Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn in a wide-ranging interview on “Inside Olympia”. “We haven’t recovered from the last trade war [in 2018],” he told host Austin Jenkins, “We’re still down 30% of exports to the Asia Pacific region because of the previous ones.”
Washington is among the most trade-dependent states in the nation, with more than $58 billion in exports in 2024 and 40% of jobs tied to trade. According to the governor’s office, new and retaliatory tariffs could cost the state’s agriculture sector $7.5 billion, with significant hits expected to apples, cherries, potatoes, wheat and dairy. India, for example, has imposed a 20% retaliatory tariff on U.S. apples, which the state says has caused shipments to fall dramatically.
Nguyễn emphasized that while the state has launched a tariff information resource and is engaging international partners like Canada, Vietnam and Mexico, its capacity is limited.
“These tariffs are even worse than what we saw last time,” he said.
Nguyễn described the Department of Commerce’s role as pivotal — but constrained — in navigating such external pressures. With 485 programs and an $8 billion portfolio, the agency manages everything from housing and behavioral health to economic development and small business grants.
“If this was a publicly traded company, you’re talking about a Fortune 500 company,” he said. “It is a behemoth in terms of the reach that we have.”
Among Commerce’s most visible challenges is the state’s growing housing crisis. Washington needs more than 1.1 million additional housing units by 2040, according to state projections, with more than half required to serve the lowest-income residents. Nguyễn acknowledged that even with a proposed $600 million investment in the Housing Trust Fund — the largest in state history — gaps remain.
“It amounts to about 2% of what we actually need on an annual basis,” he said. “So we can do as much as we can at the state to enable, in this case, affordable housing … but we need the capital markets. We need other investments.”
Interest in streamlining
Nguyễn said the state’s regulatory landscape often slows or derails projects, despite good intentions behind the rules. He cited conflicting definitions between two housing bills — one related to middle housing and another to accessory dwelling units — that have created confusion among local governments trying to comply with growth management laws.
Nguyễn said he is developing a new proposal he calls a “Fast Track,” which would apply an “abundance mindset” to housing policy by targeting areas with high need and fewer regulatory hurdles. He said the idea is still in early stages and has not yet been publicly vetted. “I have a proposal that I’m shopping with the governor’s policy team right now, said Nguyễn. “The concept aims to demonstrate that faster, more affordable construction is possible under a streamlined permitting model.
“If your goal is to build more housing, [then let’s] build more housing,” he said.
Nguyễn’s critique of bureaucratic inefficiency is grounded in his personal experience. He described the difficulty of navigating complex compliance rules required to administer state and federal grants, saying the state’s administrative and accounting manual alone is 1,067 pages. When combined with federal guidance and additional rules, it can exceed 1,500 pages per program.
“That’s longer than ‘Game of Thrones’. That’s the whole of ‘Lord of the Rings’. That’s double the longest ‘Harry Potter book’,” he said. There’s at least $300,000 to $400,000 of compliance costs associated with that.”
To tackle the problem, Nguyễn spent a recent weekend building a custom GPT chatbot using publicly available data from the state accounting manual, federal compliance guidelines and program rules. He fed in sample invoices and used the tool to rate their compliance risk as high, medium or low.
“I made a custom GPT… and it came back, and it’s fairly accurate,” he said. “There are ways for us to be much more effective so that we can still be compliant, provide the tools for our staff to be much more effective with their time and our resources.”
Nguyễn said the goal isn’t to replace state workers but to free them from rote administrative tasks so they can focus on designing programs and serving communities.
“We’ve essentially built a system where you’re trying to catch 1% who might cause a problem, and you punish everybody else,” he said.

When all the damage has been done, what will be left to salvage?
Will this beautiful house that is America — albeit in need of some major home improvements — collapse or be in irreparable disrepair?
We’re all distracted by the sound of the woodpecker on the roof, chipping away at the protective covering of our democracy. But unseen within the walls, the termites are doing catastrophic and undetected damage.
What is occurring today on the state and national level at break-neck speed is unprecedented on so many levels. We often find it difficult to keep up.
America has always been fighting with itself — with words, rarely with arms. The north against the south. Urban versus rural. Whites versus Blacks. Conservative versus liberal. Left versus right.
And, of course, we have the Democrats versus the Republicans.
You get the point. Diversity, which has taken on a toxic meaning, is and has always been what defines America.
Somehow, we have continued to co-exist. Somehow, we all have remained Americans — free to believe, free to live, free to express our differences.
But, today there is a concerted effort to tear down and redesign America into something very different.
Illegal immigration has been presented as the main area needing repair. But it won’t stop there, as the major remake taking place is to remove all diversity from the foundation of America, pillar by pillar.
Other façade and structural changes are neither superficial nor temporary but substantive and permanent whether they occur with a blast or hammer. We as bystanders or recipients often do not realize that the whole house is at risk of coming down around us.
Don’t be blinded by the immigration fix. Yes, immigration needs to be overhauled, but it should be done in the right way.
More importantly, don’t ignore or dismiss other “remodeling” taking place and think of it in isolation. For example, the removal of DEI programs is more than it may first appear. The effort has morphed into attempts to completely remove the presence and contributions of Blacks and women, including throwing out books and other evidence that document the factual and official record of American history.
You may recall it began with rendering Affirmative Action illegal, under the guise and pretext of the great lie and great illusion that equal access and opportunity are available to all citizens. The pretending and propagating continue despite the obvious realities.
The termitic behavior doesn’t stop there.
Look at the attacks on public and private education. The dismantling and dissolution of the Department of Education that provides all kinds of support for K-12 is essentially bifurcating and decentralizing what defines and constitutes a quality education for our children and the nation’s future citizens, leaving it up to individual states.
Many states are already engaged in trashing and banning books that could provide our children with a real education about the facts and history of this country.
Some of the nation’s most academically rigorous colleges and universities are being targeted and financially penalized in an effort to control who can be admitted, how they operate, and how they allow freedom of expression among their students.
An ignorant populace is easier to indoctrinate and rule.
Then, there is the wanton disregard for the rule of law, due process and ruling of the courts.
No area of American life is being left untouched by these termitic efforts to devour and destroy.
There is gutting of the military not only of personnel, but of the personal achievements and contributions of women and Blacks to this country’s safety and security that have occurred across decades. This includes removing photographs and books — all in an attempt to rewrite history and control what future cadets, soldiers, shipmen, airmen who chose to serve their country believe.
Institutions, like the treasured Smithsonian, which preserve the history of our civilization for current and future generations are not spared. An edict has been issued that targets specific collections like the African American History Museum, the Women’s History Museum, and the Art History Museum.
The purpose is to rip out or whitewash any things that may not fit the new prefabricated American house being built.
When you consider the enormous damage that can be wrought as a result of a wrecking ball being swung at agencies that oversee public health, Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security — services designed to not only protect the most vulnerable Americans, but all Americans, it begs the question: Why?
Don’t lose sight of the ongoing chipping away of the autonomy and independence of the press.
What is the end game?
Is it to change America into a white society controlled by autocratic oligarchs, where the middle class is controlled, the poor and disenfranchised continue to remain poor, uneducated, or undereducated and oppressed, and the wealthy continue to thrive?
Where freedom of the press and individual expression will be curtailed and suppressed.
The overriding question: Are we connecting the dots and getting the whole picture?
You do not have to read Project 2025. Just pay attention to what is being said and done before it is too late.
Take some time and ponder the question: Why?
More importantly, when all the termitic activity is done and a different America is left standing, will you, your children and future generations have a better country to call home?",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WeakeningAmerica2-anotherperfectday-1024x655.jpg,,,2025-04-21 07:03:31.441955

The Madison Public Library is in the process of collecting physical notes from patrons to be mailed to lawmakers. (Photo courtesy of Madison Public Library) Threatened federal funding cuts are causing uncertainty for the future of Wisconsin libraries and the programs they provide to the public, especially for those serving rural areas — and libraries are pushing Wisconsinites to talk to their lawmakers.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to downsize and begin the process of eliminating the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), an agency responsible for providing funding to states, including over $266.7 million last year. In 2024, Wisconsin received $3.23 million from the federal Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) Grants to States program, which is the largest source of federal funding support for library services in the country. 
Northern Waters Library Services Director Katherine Elchert called IMLS the “backbone” of American libraries. While the cuts could affect all libraries, Elchert said the cut would be a “direct blow” to rural libraries, including those in her system.
Elchert’s system is one of 15 public library systems across Wisconsin. It’s made up of 27 libraries in the northern part of Wisconsin and is one of the smaller population size library systems, but the largest geographical systems. It is expected to get $64,064 in federal funding — or 8% of its total funding —  from the federal government in 2025, according to DPI. 
“Most [of my libraries] are quite small and the loss of this funding will impact every single library in my system….” Elchert said, adding that patrons might not immediately recognize the impact of cuts. “It’s not like the institute is providing money so your libraries can buy books. It’s more providing large, big picture collaborations,” she said. 
Some of those collaborative programs that could be affected include interlibrary loans, a mechanism for Wisconsin libraries to share information, books and resources across the state, WISCAT, the state’s resource sharing platform, and Badgerlink, an online library that gives people access to online databases and educational resources. 
Ben Miller, library services director for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, said his team is made up of about 20 people, 16 of them funded through federal dollars. They are responsible for providing support to local libraries, including supporting collaborative programs and ensuring they work. Miller said that Wisconsin has had more than 15 million materials moved between libraries each year with the Interlibrary Loan programs and WISCAT.
“If we lost federal funding, we would be down to a skeleton of a skeleton crew of three folks,” Miller said. 
Badgerlink is funded with state dollars, Miller said, but the staff at DPI is responsible for negotiating contracts and ensuring there is access to Wisconsin residents. 
“Our team of people make that happen, and without this federal funding, that state money would pay for content that no one can access,” Miller said. 
The agency has also worked to make WISCAT more accessible.
“We pay for the platform, we staff it… we manage it, and we have folks that help with those referrals,” Miller said. “It allows us to cast requests outside of the state even, so you could get a book from Florida into Wisconsin if that is what you need.” 
The DPI also distributes federal funds in the form of grants that allow libraries to pilot programs that could become part of regular services in the future. 
A recent example, Miller said, is the JobPod Initiative in Brown County, which has helped provide resources including digital literacy training and technology skills to Wisconsinites seeking a job through their public libraries. 
Another example of a successful program is the Wisconsin Public Library Consortium, widely known as Libby, which provides people across the state with access to e-books and audiobooks.
“We provided money, found out people loved it, slowly stepped ourselves off, and then the library systems just went nuts and started buying books and things and now we have, like, the second most checkouts in the nation in Wisconsin,” Miller said. “We were able to stand that up, using this federal money to test the concept, and say, like, ‘Hey, this thing, this works. Let’s do it,’ and then they can incorporate it into their budgets.”
Miller said that his team is looking at the potential scenarios and working to provide service until they find out they aren’t funded. 
The last time the agency got communication from the IMLS, Miller said, was after the executive order, but before the appointment of Deputy Secretary of Labor Keith E. Sonderling to serve as acting director of IMLS on March 20. 
In that communication, Miller said, the federal government notified the agency that it should expect payment on April 22. Tuesday, he said, will be the next milestone. Some states, including California and Washington state, have already received notification that their Grants to States funding has been pulled.
Wisconsin’s library agency hasn’t had any communication with the federal government lately, though it has been monitoring for anything new. Miller said the program officer assigned to Wisconsin was part of the staff put on administrative leave in March. 
Typically, Miller said, he would be preparing to finalize the budget and preparing to put out grant applications, but he said his agency will be proceeding with caution, even if the state does get the funding on Tuesday.
“We’re holding back until we have a better picture of the future… We have questions about how this will look,” Miller said. “All of this funding is contingent on the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018, which comes up for renewal this October, and so even if we get this money next week, we’re going to be really gun shy about putting that out until we know the future of IMLS as an institution and Grants to States moving forward.”
Miller said that the agency is also waiting to see what comes from a multi-state lawsuit launched by 20 states, including Wisconsin, challenging the Trump administration’s cuts to the IMLS and arguing that it violates the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Elchert said the programs funded with federal money and the work of the state supporting those programs are important for broadening the collections available to libraries “particularly in those rural areas that don’t have the space or the budget to have those large collections that, say, Madison does.” 
Elchert noted that South Dakota recently announced it is suspending its interlibrary loan service in light of the federal cuts.
“My library system could not provide all of these resources. It’d be — I don’t even know how much it would cost to try and it just wouldn’t happen to be frank,” Elchert said. “So everybody is losing access to all of these larger resources that connect Wisconsin to the larger world.”
Elchert noted that the federal cuts are also affecting tribal libraries, which had their federal funds cut a couple of weeks ago. There are two, the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe University Community Library and the Ben Guthrie Lac Du Flambeau Public Library, in her system.
The cuts would hit Wisconsin’s urban libraries as well.
“Ironically, this [executive order] is supposed to eliminate government inefficiency, but this is an incredibly efficient system to offer these services statewide and have them run at the state level with federal funds or any funds for that matter,” said Tana Elias, director of the Madison Public Library.
Elias said that if the funding isn’t awarded there will likely be a “scramble” in July to figure out what programs could be stopped initially and over time.
“It may be that we have to go back to the vendor and renegotiate a contract or renegotiate a reduction in service that we can afford in the meantime, while we wait for all of this to play out,” Elias said. “It’s a lot of uncertainty.”
According to a joint statement from Madison Public Library and Madison Children’s Museum, IMLS has awarded an average of 18 grants per year to Wisconsin museums, libraries and other institutions over the last 15 years — totaling nearly $70 million dollars over that span.
The Madison library was also notified that one of its recent grants that helped support the Observation Deck, a program that was being used to measure and illustrate the impact of library programming and support librarians in improving it, was canceled. She said the library had spent about half of the $240,000 awarded before it was canceled. 
“It’s a reduction,” Elias said. “But we have a plan to continue and wrap up that project with the funding that we have now.” That plan includes not moving forward with a second grant request and paying for service directly so the platform can continue to be used. “We won’t be able to expand it and offer it for other public libraries to use,” she said.
Elias added that she was concerned that the cuts could limit professional opportunities for library staff. Currently, she said many of those opportunities become available through DPI at little to no cost. She said professional training and ensuring staff have support will be even more important if public services shrink in other areas. 
“Library funding is being targeted. Humanities funding is being targeted. Arts funding is coming. We all know that education funding is being targeted as more of those funds slip away from us… as all of those safety nets shrink and fray, people will be coming to libraries more and more,” Elias said. “I think it’s even more important that we continue to have strong funding for libraries, because they’re kind of a safety net for a lot of people.” 
Elias said advocacy on behalf of libraries by Wisconsin residents and other stakeholders is essential right now. The Madison Public Library is in the process of collecting physical notes from patrons to be mailed to lawmakers. 
The Wisconsin Public Library Consortium, which includes all of the public library systems in the state, has put together a webpage to inform residents about and encourage them to lobby their lawmakers for funding.
“It does make a difference. Legislators do listen to their constituents, and I think because we are working on a statewide campaign across the whole state, we’ll hit both those Republican and Democratic legislators… I think having bipartisan support is really important,” Elias said. 
Elchert of the Northern Waters system said that librarians are “scrappy” and everyone is working to help the community.
“It’s important that patrons know that their library services will be impacted if these cuts go through,” Elchert said. “It’s not a matter of will it be felt, but how badly will it be felt.”

The Canyon County Pride president said the event was meant to be family friendly. But after an individual attending the event wore nipple pasties — despite requests from event organizers to put on a shirt — Idaho state lawmakers crafted House Bill 270 this year.
The bill updates the law to ban the public exposure of female breasts, male breasts altered to look like female breasts, artificial breasts and products resembling genitals. Gov. Brad Little signed the bill into law, and it’s effective immediately.
House Bill 270 is among several Idaho bills that received national attention for targeting LGBTQ+ rights, particularly for transgender individuals. Those pieces of legislation were a part of a larger effort by Idaho lawmakers to limit diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs; sex education; government display of pride flags; and medical treatment for transgender individuals — policies that reflect similar efforts by the Trump administration.
“It’s unsurprising, but it’s really disappointing that that’s how these Republican legislators are spending their time,” Wheeler told the Idaho Capital Sun. “They’re very obsessed with gay people.”
In his testimony against House Bill 270, Nikson Mathews, a trans man, said the bill would criminalize him for doing something as simple as mowing his lawn while shirtless. The Idaho transgender rights advocate said the 2025 legislative session was the “worst session” he’s experienced.

“Our community — every year, but I think this year especially — is getting smaller because there’s just so much uncertainty happening right now,” Mathews told the Sun. “It kind of feels like our futures are being stolen from us because of what is happening nationally and what is happening locally.”
He called the first pieces of legislation introduced this session — both of which targeted LGBTQ+ individuals — a “damning introduction” to the kinds of laws that would make their way through the Statehouse.
“This is our home and our community, and so we will stay as long as we possibly can,” Mathews said about himself and his partner. “But I’ll tell you, every single queer person — especially trans people in this state — we’re all planning for what is that line when we have to make a decision to leave.”

 At least 10 anti-LGBTQ+ policies were adopted in Idaho in 2025

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)
Idaho Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise said the around two dozen anti-LGBTQ+ bills considered in Idaho this year work together. 
“The cumulative effect is with the intention to erase and not recognize human beings based on who they are,” she told the Sun. “And that is the definition of discrimination. So, this Legislature has embraced formal discrimination.”
Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, sponsored several of this year’s bills — but she said they aren’t connected. And she pushed back on concerns that the Legislature is making it harder for LGBTQ+ people to live in Idaho.
“Nobody’s making it harder for them to live in Idaho,” said Ehardt, a basketball coach who years earlier championed an Idaho bill that inspired other states to ban transgender kids from playing sports with students of their same gender. “They keep choosing to create and make themselves a victim. They’re not a victim. Just go to school. Be a normal school kid. Just study normal school academics.”
In addition to House Bill 270, the Idaho Capital Sun has compiled a list of legislation crafted during the 2025 legislative session that impacts LGBTQ+ individuals living in Idaho. The following bills passed largely along party lines in both legislative chambers, and were signed into law by Gov. Little:

Transgender bathroom, dorm ban in state facilities 
House Bill 264 directs state correctional facilities, colleges and universities and domestic violence shelters to designate multi-occupancy restrooms, changing rooms and dorm rooms “for the exclusive use by either females or males.” The bill says those facilities must only be used by “members of that sex.”
Ehardt said the bill was inspired by a national workgroup that spawned from her bill years earlier to restrict transgender students’ sports participation. 
The group, she said, included around 20 groups, including influential conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the Alliance Defending Freedom, and an anti-trans feminist organization, the Women’s Liberation Front, also known as WoLF.
In women’s prisons, Ehardt said the WoLF group became aware that “men were starting to identify,” a trend she said started in California but has happened elsewhere.

Around 60 to 70 patients in Idaho Department of Correction custody have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, court documents released in a lawsuit last year showed. 
“If they watch what’s happening in the rest of the states, it’s only a matter before they start making their claim to be able to come to the women’s spaces,” Ehardt told the Sun.
“This legislation has absolutely nothing to do with the L, the G or the B. It only has to do with the T, and very narrowly defined,” she said.

Denying medical procedures depending on moral beliefs
House Bill 59 allows health care workers to deny participating in medical procedures that violate their religious and moral beliefs. 
Sponsors: Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa; Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene
Status: In effect
Requiring parents opt in to human sexuality education 
House Bill 239 requires parents or guardians to opt in to education on sexuality and gender identity.
The bill requires parental consent for teachings about human sexuality, incorporating an existing definition in Idaho law that includes broader sex education concepts. The law’s legal definition for abstinence includes sexual activities that can result in pregnancy, risk transmitting sexually transmitted diseases or infections; or present emotional risks. 
Ehardt said she’d been working on the bill since her first year in the Legislature. She said she pulled the human sexuality definition largely from the World Health Organization. While the definition affects LGBTQ+ sexuality teachings, she said it wasn’t targeted at that — just “all things sexual in nature.
“The sex was rampant. It could have been, you know, heterosexual sex. It could have been homosexual. It didn’t matter,” Ehardt told the Sun. “It’s not necessary. The kids don’t need to be exposed to any of that.”
This year, she said she reached out to the Pacific Justice Institute, a conservative legal defense nonprofit based in California, for help crafting the bill’s civil cause of action. The bill allows school boards to cure potential violations before a parent can sue.

Another DEI ban
Senate Bill 1198 follows years of legislative efforts to purge DEI in Idaho colleges and universities. It will ban DEI in higher ed: Hiring, employment practices, and “promoting differential treatment” or benefits to people. And it stops higher ed institutions from requiring DEI classes outside of a degree program students choose, Idaho Education News reported.

 Stepping into direct action amid anti-LGBTQ+ Idaho policies

Despite the passage of many of these laws, LGBTQ+ advocates are planning Pride events across the Gem State later this year, including pride celebrations in Coeur d’Alene and Nampa in June, and Boise Pride in September. 
Wheeler said this year’s Canyon County Pride will be bigger than last year’s — and with more security measures. It will be held from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. June 8 at Lakeview Park in Nampa. 
“We’ve tripled the space,” he said. “We’re tripling the six-foot privacy fencing for security purposes. Half of our budget is invested in private security and safety precautions.”
There are 70 businesses participating in the upcoming event, Wheeler said. 
“This administration and the times we are in have shown us that we really can’t rely on the institutions that we pay our tax dollars to to protect and support us,” Wheeler said. “It’s more important now than ever to just be involved in direct action. Canyon County Pride is that direct action. It’s a day to recognize how many individuals are in the community that really do exist and have these needs.”

(Getty Images)Since 2013, a Wisconsin law has blocked workers who lose a job from collecting unemployment insurance if they also receive Social Security disability benefits.
A federal judge ruled in July 2024 that the exclusion violates federal law. Nine months later, however, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) continues to reject unemployment claims from laid-off workers who are also on disability.
The delay in implementing the judge’s ruling frustrates workers such as Judy Fintz of La Crosse. Fintz receives a monthly Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payment of $1,400. By itself it’s not enough to live on, she says, but she’s able to work part-time at a college dining hall to help make ends meet.
When the dining hall is closed between semesters and during breaks, her income drops — but unlike other employees, she can’t file for unemployment insurance (UI) to tide her over during those periods.
“I work very hard on my job,” Fintz said in a telephone interview. “I shouldn’t have to have all this problem going on.”
The 2013 Wisconsin law that blocks SSDI recipients from collecting unemployment insurance passed the state Legislature with only Republican support and was signed into law by then-Gov. Scott Walker.
It was enacted to “prevent the payment of duplicative government benefits for the replacement of lost earnings or income, regardless of an individual’s ability to work,” in the words of the statute. A proposal in 2012 from the Walker administration claimed that most SSDI recipients didn’t work and therefore, if they collected unemployment pay, they were “double-dipping” and probably committing “fraud.”
The federal Social Security Administration program allows disability insurance recipients to work part-time if they are able to, however. The program  encourages them to do so under procedures structured to ensure they do not lose their disability payments or their medical coverage under Medicaid.
  Victor Forberger
Victor Forberger, a Madison lawyer who represents people making unemployment insurance claims, says Wisconsin has thousands of SSDI recipients who also work part-time.
Forberger is one of a team of lawyers who sued DWD on behalf of eight plaintiffs in 2021, charging that the state ban on jobless pay for SSDI recipients violated federal laws that protect people with disabilities. Lawyers from Gingras, Thomsen & Wachs and Axley Brynelson were also part of the case.
On July 17, 2024, Judge William Conley ruled on summary judgment that the 2013 law violated two federal laws: the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. In his decision Conley stated that while Wisconsin law didn’t intentionally discriminate against people with disabilities, it “applies only to individuals with disabilities, meaning that it necessarily has a disparate impact on those with disabilities.”
Conley’s ruling put off a remedy for the plaintiffs. The lawsuit was filed as a class action, and lawyers for the plaintiffs and DWD have conflicting views about who should be included in the class action as well what remedies are appropriate. A hearing is scheduled for later this year to decide what groups of people would qualify for a remedy and what the remedies should be.
Those questions relate to people who made claims in the past however — SSDI recipients whose UI claims were denied, or whose claims were initially accepted, then reversed, and who were required to repay their unemployment compensation.
DWD has not indicated any plans to appeal the judge’s summary judgment finding.
Since the July ruling, however, DWD has continued to reject UI claims from laid-off workers who are  also on SSDI, Forberger said — ignoring Conley’s conclusion that doing so violates federal law.
“There’s no logic that I’m aware of that would indicate why a disabled worker today filing for unemployment benefits should be denied unemployment benefits,” Forberger said.
In response to an inquiry from the Wisconsin Examiner, Lee Sensenbrenner, communications director for DWD, said in an email message, “Due to the ongoing litigation here, we won’t be able to comment.”
Judy Fintz is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the SSDI restriction. She said she thought after the judge’s ruling was issued that she and other SSDI recipients would now qualify for unemployment benefits.
“If it’s discrimination — and that’s what the judge said — that’s what they should go on,” she said.
Forberger, who participated with Fintz in her telephone interview, pointed out that based on her work history and wage rate, Fintz would have a weekly unemployment insurance payment of $81.
“They’re refusing to pay her $81 a week under this eligibility ban,” he said. “Judy’s not getting rich off anything.”
Another plaintiff in the lawsuit, Cliff Neuman, combines his disability payment from SSDI with part-time work he is able to take on.
Until the beginning of this year, Neuman was working part time at a grocery store. One day, he said, the store stopped scheduling him for shifts. He said he never got an explanation why.
With Forberger’s help he filed unemployment insurance claims each week for the five or six weeks he was out of work before finding a new job as a restaurant dishwasher. “A couple of times we called and people refused to help him because they said he gets SSDI and is not eligible,” Forberger said.
One requirement for UI applicants is to regularly search for new work and to document those searches. Neuman followed through on that requirement, but his UI applications got mired in rejections and appeals.
An administrative law judge found in February that Neuman was eligible, a consequence of the Conley decision in July. After a DWD lawyer asked for reconsideration, however, the administrative law judge set aside his earlier finding.
DWD’s lawyer argued that the July federal court ruling is not final and that since Conley had not issued an injunction against following the 2013 law, Conley’s decision could not be used to overrule the decision to deny Neuman’s UI claim.
Forberger submitted a response arguing that where new claims are concerned, the Conley decision should be treated as final.
The administrative law judge responded by setting aside his own earlier ruling and asking both DWD and Forberger to address additional questions.
Neuman was disappointed by that outcome and his inability to collect UI despite the Conley ruling in July.
Getting jobless pay “shouldn’t matter if I had SSDI or not,” Neuman said. “Once you’re working you should get that.”
The denial of his claims is “not right and fair,” he said. “To me that’s picking on people that have disabilities.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)As Republicans in Congress consider cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, states are weighing numerous options to scale back their programs. But voters in three states have significantly limited those options by enshrining Medicaid expansion in their constitutions — creating a potential budget disaster and a political challenge for the GOP.
Over the past several years, voters in conservative Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have amended their state constitutions to require their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the age of 65 who earn equal to or less than 138% of the federal poverty level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Those states are among the 40 plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, with the federal government picking up 90% of the cost.
But much of that federal funding could soon vanish. Republicans in Congress are debating several options to achieve $880 billion in Medicaid cuts. One proposal would slash the 90% rate to the lower match rates states get for the traditional Medicaid population, mainly children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women. Those percentages range from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
If Congress goes that route, states would have to come up with $626 billion over the next decade to keep the roughly 20 million people in the expansion population on the rolls.
Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have laws on the books that would automatically roll back Medicaid expansion if the federal funds dip. Some states are considering requiring people to work, go to school or volunteer in order to receive Medicaid benefits, a condition that would trim the rolls and save money.
But because Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have put Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, they can’t easily take those steps.
“Legislators cannot change that law without going back to voters for a whole other campaign to change the constitution,” said Kelly Hall, the executive director of the Fairness Project, a nonprofit that helped put the constitutional amendments on the ballot in all three states.
“Even if the federal government cuts their contribution towards funding Medicaid expansion, those three states do not have the option to reduce eligibility or benefits for the Medicaid expansion population,” she told Stateline. “They will have to find those resources.”
Medicaid is a huge component of state budgets. Including the federal matching money, states spend an average of nearly a third of their budgets on Medicaid. And the program is also the single largest source of federal funds for states.
Missourians voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to expand Medicaid in August 2020. When state lawmakers refused to fund the expansion, residents sued the state’s Department of Social Services. In 2021, the state Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had to find the resources for Medicaid expansion — a huge win for progressives.
For 2025, Missouri allotted $18.2 billion for Medicaid, with the federal government covering $12.7 billion of that, or about 70%. If Congress cuts the federal share of Medicaid funding by $880 billion over the next decade, it would leave Missouri with a budget hole of around $1.7 billion next year, according to research from nonprofit group the Commonwealth Fund. That would force the state to come up with some options to avoid fiscal disaster.
Timothy McBride, a health policy analyst and co-director of a program at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, told Stateline that these include raising taxes, cutting enrollment for other Medicaid populations, diminishing reimbursements to providers, getting rid of optional medical services such as dental care or ceasing payments for equipment like wheelchairs.
Raising taxes is not a likely or popular choice in Republican-leaning Missouri, McBride noted, while adding that cuts to providers would further endanger struggling hospitals.
“We lost 10 hospitals in Missouri in the last few years. And if you start cutting their payment rates, that’s going to just put them at risk,” McBride said. “The real money is in the disabled and the elderly populations. And so if you really wanted to quote-unquote save money, that’s probably where you’d have to look. But that’s really controversial.”
The state budgetary implications of a potentially sharp decline in federal Medicaid funding have influenced some prominent opponents of Medicaid expansion to have a change of heart. U.S. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley supported efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018 when he was Missouri’s attorney general. Now, Hawley has said he would refuse to vote for any Medicaid cuts.
“I’m not going to vote for Medicaid cuts, benefit cuts. Work requirements are fine. But 21% of the residents in my state receive Medicaid or [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. That’s a lot of people,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill in February.
Republicans in the closely divided U.S. Congress might have trouble pushing through Medicaid cuts if other conservative lawmakers from Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota follow Hawley’s lead.
Oklahoma voters expanded Medicaid via a constitutional amendment in 2020. South Dakota followed suit in 2022. Republicans in all three states want to impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, but doing so would not save enough money to make up for the loss of federal dollars.
South Dakota Republican state Rep. Will Mortenson said he respects that voters chose to expand Medicaid, and added that the state has “faithfully” implemented it. But the decision to amend the state constitution “can only be described as a foolish decision,” he said in an interview.
“A constitution is not meant to be a flexible document that you change annually or even every other year,” Mortenson said. “And so now, as we’re staring down the barrel of the federal government contemplating changes to Medicaid, including for the expansion population, our state is hamstrung in that we cannot effectively respond to those changes.”
Mortenson is one of the lead sponsors of a bill that would ask voters to consider a ballot measure in the next general election to amend the constitution again, this time conditioning Medicaid expansion on the level of federal assistance. The measure has passed both chambers of the legislature.
But some of the supporters of the original constitutional amendment say they would fight any attempt to change it. Any restrictions, including work requirements, would severely harm working-class people, said Doug Sombke, head of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Sombke told Stateline that most farmers in the state struggle to make ends meet and certainly cannot offer high wages or health care benefits to their workers.
“There’s just no extra income,” Sombke said. “And, in South Dakota, we’re a right-to-work state, so you can get fired for any reason. As a worker, you really don’t have a lot of choice.”
Hall, of the Fairness Project, said amending the constitution is the most effective way to expand Medicaid in states where conservative-leaning lawmakers have been reluctant to do so. She said she suspects that voters in other states might pursue the constitutional amendment strategy if their state lawmakers try to roll back expansion.
“I do think that it’s possible that if we see these cuts move forward in D.C., and states are making highly unpopular choices to cut benefits for people, that we will see this issue back at the ballot box,” Hall said. “But for right now, I would say we’re seeing the power of constitutional amendments to protect benefits in action in real time.”

(Courtesy photo)Something is missing from Harrison County Hospital’s website. The homepage used to feature birth announcements with pictures, names and weights. However, the proud declarations have been taken down since the facility’s labor and delivery services closed on April 1.
Harrison County Hospital’s obstetric department is one of over a dozen that have shut down statewide since 2020, according to Steve Cooke, senior director of public relations at the Indiana Hospital Association.
“About 70% of these closures were in the last two years,” he said.
  Steve Cooke, senior director of public relations at the Indiana Hospital Association.
A March of Dimes report revealed nearly a quarter of Indiana counties are considered maternity care deserts. The growing trend is concerning because lack of access to high-quality care is a factor in maternal and infant mortality rates. 
A 2022 Indiana University Indianapolis brief showed Indiana has the third highest maternal mortality rate among reporting states at 44 deaths per 100,000 live births. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ranked Indiana 7th in infant mortality rates by state with 7.16 infant deaths per 1,000 live births.
Reasons for OB unit closures include staffing shortages, declining birth rates and low Medicaid reimbursement rates. Potential solutions involve expanding access to mobile health centers, making reimbursement rates sustainable and increasing the workforce by incorporating midwives, according to Honour Hill, director of maternal and infant health initiatives for March of Dimes in Alabama.
“We know that certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives are associated with significantly improved maternal and neonatal outcomes, including reduced rates of preterm birth, C-sections and the like,” she said.
Why OB units are closing
The Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform reported more than 80 hospitals have stopped labor and delivery services nationwide since 2022. Cooke said 14 OB units shut down in Indiana over the last five years:

IU Health Jay Hospital in Portland (2020)
Franciscan Health in Hammond (2021)
Pulaski Memorial Hospital in Winamac (2022)
Ascension St. Vincent Dunn Hospital in Bedford (2022) 
Parkview Wabash Hospital (2023)
St. Joseph Health Plymouth Medical Center (2023)
St. Elizabeth Dearborn Hospital in Lawrenceburg (2023)
Parkview DeKalb Hospital in Auburn (2023)
Parkview LaGrange Hospital (2023)
Perry County Memorial Hospital in Tell City (2023)
Parkview Whitley Hospital in Columbia City (2024) 
Bluffton Regional Medical Center (2024)
Dukes Memorial Hospital in Peru (2024)
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon (2025)

At Harrison County Hospital, the issue wasn’t fewer deliveries, according to Chief Operating Officer Lisa Lieber. The department performed up to 400 deliveries a year. However, both of the hospital’s OB providers left, and recruitment efforts to replace them were unsuccessful. Sarah Doughtery, marketing and physician recruitment manager, said the decision to close the unit was not made lightly. 
  Harrison County Hospital Chief Operating Officer Lisa Lieber
“As Dr. [Lisa] Clunie, our CEO, often says, she was born at Harrison County Hospital. Lisa [Lieber] and I were both born at Harrison County Hospital. We had our children at Harrison County Hospital, all three of us,” she said.
Lieber said many OB physicians want a better work-life balance with a steadier schedule and less time on-call. Granting those requests can be taxing when it comes to the needs of a small region.
“A lot of the providers are either looking to retire or in their retirement. They’re telling us that they want to do hospital-based work. So they might just want to be a laborist. They want to go to a hospital where they just work a 12-hour shift. They just deliver who comes into that hospital. In our community, that just doesn’t work. We can’t operate that way,” said Dougherty.
For OB departments with declining birth rates, the challenge lies in compensation. Each year, Indiana’s low Medicaid base rates force hospitals to cover about $2.7 billion in unpaid health care expenses, according to IHA President Scott B. Tittle.
“Which is one of the reasons so many hospitals are struggling financially today, and some must make the difficult and unfortunate decisions to eliminate certain health care services, especially in rural areas,” he said.
Maternity care desert impacts
When OB units close, pregnant women must find new providers. Brittany Duke had three daughters at Perry County Memorial Hospital in Tell City before switching to Deaconess Women’s Hospital in Newburgh to deliver her fourth daughter in 2024.
“It’s easier for my family to be around [PCMH]” she said. “I already knew how everything ran down here, and I felt so comfortable with it all. It was stressful having to figure out whether New Albany, Jasper, Owensboro [KY] or Evansville would be the best.”
  Indiana Hospital Association President Scott Tittle
Hoosier women living in maternity care deserts travel three times farther for services than those with full access, according to the March of Dimes. Lexie Pendleton, a former nurse in Harrison County Hospital’s OB unit, said some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care before the closure.
“Now they are being forced to drive an extra 20 minutes on top of that to get to a hospital with obstetric care and also to see their providers for their prenatal visits,” she said.
Hill said additional travel time for OB services can become a significant issue for expectant mothers.
“Especially for those moms with high-risk pregnancies or chronic diseases, or even those moms who are having perfectly healthy pregnancies but end up in an obstetric emergency,” said Hill. “Women with chronic conditions have about a 51% increased likelihood of preterm birth.”
The March of Dimes disclosed that 15.5% of pregnant women in Indiana received inadequate prenatal care, a higher percentage than the U.S. rate of 14.8%. Plus, only 2.5% of OB providers practiced in rural counties while 4.5% of babies were born to women living in those areas.
“We are dedicated to trying to remain a place where people could grow their family if it is feasible to be able to do so,” said Dougherty. “We’d like to be a resource to help set people up if they need prenatal care and don’t know where to go. We can help them find those resources through our [gynecology] office. But they could also go to their family practice doctor and figure out where to start.”
Advocating for solutions
For expectant moms looking for an OB provider outside their county, getting recommendations from other women with similar experiences is helpful. Kate Kenealy, who delivered a stillborn infant and a rainbow baby at Harrison County Hospital, said finding the right environment is essential.
“Ask your friends who have kids, who have gone through OBGYN offices for whatever reason, ask them about the atmosphere,” she said. “[The Harrison County Hospital OB unit was] there for us. For all the moms, for all the dads, for all the babies. They were there for us personally and medically, for their career, but mainly because they cared about us.”
Expanded access to accredited and licensed freestanding birth centers and mobile health centers would also make a difference, according to Hill. March of Dimes has Mom and Baby Mobile Health Centers in Arizona, Ohio, Washington, D.C. and New York with plans to launch more in Ohio, Texas and Alabama. 
“If anyone is interested in joining us in doing that, both on the provider side as well as sponsorship side, we’d love to see that come to Indiana,” said Hill.
  Sarah Doughtery, marketing and physician recruitment manager at Harrison County Hospital
As for birth rates and compensation, Tittle said House Bill 1004 has a provision that would draw more federal Medicaid funds at no cost to the state.
“With these additional federal dollars, we can enhance much-needed reimbursement rates for hospitals, which will best enable rural birthing hospitals to improve access and health outcomes for Hoosier mothers and babies,” he said.
Another focus area for improvement is diversifying the workforce with midwifery care and other specialties.
“Making sure our emergency rooms, whether there is an obstetric unit there, are trained in obstetric emergencies because we know when we do see a unit close due to maybe low volume, that those women, if they do have an emergency, they’re going to their emergency room,” Hill said.
Despite the struggles, Harrison County Hospital has not given up on its quest to reopen labor and delivery services. Dougherty said the facility is working with three recruitment agencies, including one based in Bloomington. It would likely take four OB providers to reinstate the unit, according to Lieber.
“Could be an OB-GYN, a family practice with an OB fellowship would be someone we would look at. Midwives, we’ve opened that up. So we’re looking at all avenues of ways we could staff the department,” she said.
Hill advised women to raise awareness about their maternity care desert experiences.
“Have that conversation with providers, but also with your representatives and your legislators about how that impacts your life. Change can’t be made unless there are voices saying that it does need to be made,” she said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma lawmakers are clearly scared to death of their constituents, and who could blame them?
After all, voters in recent years have forced our lawmakers to come face-to-face with the terrifying reality that average Oklahomans can band together to circumvent the Legislature’s will and force the passage of new progressive laws and block boneheaded conservative policies.
In short, by taking matters into their own hands by expanding Medicaid access for the working poor and reducing the state’s over-incarceration rates through criminal justice reforms, voters have repeatedly been serving lawmakers an unwanted reminder that the influence of rural Oklahoma is dwindling as the state’s population continues to shift to more politically diverse urban centers.
I can understand how that must be a scary prospect for a Republican-led governing body whose members typically take immense pride in thinking up conservative policies. And, I suspect that’s probably why lawmakers continue to monkey around with Oklahomans’ constitutionally guaranteed right to put their own proposed laws or constitutional amendments on the ballot.
It’s already an uphill battle to qualify measures for the ballot considering the enormous signature collection requirements — over 92,000 for a statutory change and over 172,000 for a constitutional amendment — and the 90-day window to gather those.
But just when you think it can’t get any worse, Republican lawmakers, led by House Speaker Kyle Hilbert and Sen. David Bullard, are telling us to hold their beer. In case you’re not familiar with the idiom, it’s what people say when they’re about to do something extremely foolish that they’ll likely regret later.
Oklahoma lawmakers are plowing ahead with a bizarre — and likely unconstitutional — scheme that seeks to disproportionately inflate the influence of rural voters at the expense of urban and suburban ones. 
They want to cap how many people living in each county can sign petitions. At most, that means only 20.8% of signatures can come from one county, which potentially disenfranchised tens of thousands of their constituents. 
And, among other things, their latest scheme also prevents people who live outside the state from working here to collect signatures, requires them to only be paid by Oklahoma entities and allows an appointed bureaucrat with no legal experience to decide how ballot summaries should be worded.
Supporters say these changes will ensure rural voters have a bigger say on what’s included on the ballot by forcing signature collectors to visit rural communities. Critics argue it attempts to dilute the influence of those living in urban counties.
Whatever the reasoning, the entire concept is an expensive lawsuit waiting to happen. Taxpayers should expect to foot that bill because the moment Gov. Kevin Stitt’s pen turns this into law, our state is going to get sued for violating people’s constitutional rights. 
And, they should.
Last time I checked, we lived in a state where every citizen is worth the same regardless of where they live. It’s mindboggling to argue that rural perspectives are worth more in a state where about 50% of the population lives in urban areas.
And, I’ve always lived with the philosophy that the more choices we have on the ballot, the better for our democracy. Voters, after all, deserve choice because they aren’t stupid. I may not agree with every ballot measure, but I respect my neighbor’s ability to put it up for a vote.
Unfortunately, I don’t think many of our lawmakers have that same philosophy. Let’s be honest, how often do we hear Republican legislators insult our intelligence by insisting that we don’t know what is best for ourselves or we didn’t understand what we voted for. 
Lawmakers always think they know what’s best for us — until voters are given the power to put some of those crazed ideas in their proper place — the trash can.

In September, the convictions of Robert and his brother David Bintz in the 1987 murder of Sandra Lison were overturned. The brothers left prison more two decades after they were convicted. 
“I missed my mom, before she died,” Robert Bintz told the Examiner in November. His mother passed away while he was incarcerated. “I missed my niece, Hannah. Got killed by a horrible car accident… I missed my job I once had.”
Upon his release from prison, Robert didn’t receive any reentry assistance from the state, according to his compensation request to the Wisconsin Claims Board in February. His sister isn’t able to meet his complex needs, the request said. 
The brothers are seeking $2 million apiece from the state for their imprisonment. Their compensation requests cite high anticipated costs for health care. 
“He’s 68 years old,” Isaiah Eastling, Robert’s nephew, told the Examiner in November. “It’s not fair for him to have to go and get a job like all of us, and just to try to get back into society like that. That’s impossible.”
Wisconsin law caps compensation for wrongful imprisonment at $25,000, unless the state Legislature grants more compensation, which is rare.
To award money, the Wisconsin Claims Board must find that evidence of innocence is “clear and convincing” and that the petitioner did not contribute to bring about their conviction and imprisonment by something they did or failed to do.
Jarrett Adams, an attorney working with the Bintz brothers, doesn’t yet know if they have a claim for a federal lawsuit, he said in late February. He said the brothers might not have an opportunity to get compensation if the state does not award it.
Robert’s sister, Cindy Eastling, said Robert called her every week when he was in prison. But she “had no idea that he had all these health issues.”
With little time to prepare, Eastling wasn’t ready for Robert’s arrival, she told the Examiner in November. His eye and arm were bruised, and he later told her he was beat up, she said.
He requires around-the-clock care and 20 daily medications for physical and mental health conditions, which worsened without sufficient medical attention in the prison system, according to his compensation claim. Eastling said her brothers will probably need assistance for the rest of their lives, and that they could be taken advantage of on their own.
“Bobby knows I love him, but it really took a toll on me,” Eastling said. “…I wasn’t prepared, and then the way he showed up, he looked absolutely horrible… he looks so much [healthier] now. We’re doing one physical problem at a time.”
Eastling said Robert’s asthma had improved. He used to use a nebulizer multiple times a day, she said. When Eastling spoke to the Examiner, he hadn’t used it in three weeks.
“Honestly, it scared me,” Eastling said. “I thought one morning I’d wake up and he’d be dead.”

The brothers have health care coverage, but it’s a challenge at times, Carla Broadnax of Jarrett Adams Law said in late February. 
Broadnax said that “accessing consistent care is persistently tricky, partially due to the cost associated with transportation, medical appointments, and necessary medications.” 
Housing has been an issue for both brothers, according to the compensation requests filed in February. After trying to find housing at shelters, David found a place to stay in Appleton through the help of a local nonprofit. 
David’s shared housing situation is temporary and not sufficient to meet his needs, as of his compensation request. Robert’s request said he hasn’t been able to acquire housing that can assist him with the round-the-clock support needed. 
Cindy Eastling thinks the system should work faster to support her brothers in the short term. A GoFundMe for David Bintz raised $4,165, with a $10,000 goal. Robert’s GoFundMe raised $12,829 with a $20,000 goal. David’s compensation request said his monthly disability and social security payments cover only his most basic needs. 
“This leaves everybody scrambling, [when] somebody like David and Robert gets out,” Adams said. “Everybody’s just trying to do what they can.”
Adams himself was once incarcerated and released after his conviction was overturned,and he co-founded the organization Life After Justice, which supports wrongfully convicted people. In late February, he said the brothers are receiving mental health care through the organization.

“…He’s holding back a lot of things, I can tell,” Cindy Eastling said about Robert Bintz. “And he’s always happy, but bad things happened to him in there.” 
How were the Bintz brothers prosecuted? 
In 1999, the brothers were charged with the 1987 murder of Sandra Lison, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. Testing of semen from a rape kit found that it didn’t belong to the brothers, and blood found under Lison’s body was not theirs. 
Additional DNA testing obtained by the Wisconsin Innocence Project in 2006 confirmed that blood found on Lison’s dress came from the same male whose sperm was found in the rape kit, according to the exonerations registry. A motion for a new trial was denied.
The Brown County Attorney’s Office prosecuted the brothers with a theory of robbery and murder. After the brothers’ exoneration in September, Brown County District Attorney David Lasee spoke to NBC 26.
“The prosecutors and the law enforcement officers were handling this case at the outset, followed the evidence that they had at that time, and that conviction was sound,” Lasee said.
Evidence against the brothers included statements from incarcerated people who said David had admitted to the crime.
In an interview with detectives, David Bintz eventually agreed to a statement that he and his brother were involved and that his brother had strangled Lison, according to David’s page in the National Registry of Exonerations. At the same time, he gave contradictory statements that he wasn’t involved and was home at the time of the crime.
David Bintz’s request for compensation claims that Bintz, who was intellectually disabled, was interrogated for over six hours, “depriving him of food, water and restroom breaks in clear violation of his rights.”
“During the interrogation, David Bintz maintained his innocence, but after several hours, he made confused and contradictory statements — some of which confirmed Swendby’s allegations, others which stressed his innocence,” the request states.
The request says David was coerced by the pressure and tactics of the detectives and signed a false statement implicating himself and Robert Bintz in Lison’s murder.
The Examiner asked Jarrett Adams Law about the sources the firm used for a section of the compensation request about the confession. Facts in the firm’s complaint, findings from investigative reports and communication with the Bintz brothers provided the context and basis for that part of the request, Broadnax said. 
Of 375 DNA exonerations between 1989 and 2020 tracked by the Innocence Project, over a quarter involved a false confession. 
The brothers had multiple convictions prior to their convictions in Lison’s murder, according to Brown County court records. In 1997, David was sentenced to prison for sexual assault. 
Jarrett Adams said that the identity of Lison’s attacker is now known and “nothing else matters but that. It wasn’t them.” 
Last year, investigative genetic genealogy linked crime scene evidence to three male children of a couple in the Green Bay area. In August, the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory determined that substances at the crime scene pointed conclusively to William Hendricks, who had a history of violent sexual attacks before his death in 2000. 
“The notion that Ms. Lison was having a secret sexual relationship with a recently-released convicted rapist is utterly implausible,” the Great North Innocence Project said in a motion to vacate Robert Bintz’s conviction, according to the exonerations registry.  
Life after exoneration
If the Bintz brothers receive compensation from the state, they have ideas for how to use it beyond paying for health care expenses. In late February,  Broadnax told the Examiner about the brothers’ plans.

They both want to own a home, she said. In an interview with the Examiner, David talked about helping others.“I’d help a couple people out that ain’t got nothing,” he said.
Robert wants to travel and see the world, and David wants to eat home-cooked food, Broadnax said. 
“The food was straight garbage,” David said of the food in prison. “Half [the] time, I didn’t eat the food. I just bought stuff off canteen if I could.”
David has been making cards, Broadnax said. He sends cards to about four to five incarcerated people, and also uses his cards and designs to help with the decor at Mountains of Hope, the nonprofit through which he found a place to stay. 
“That was my hobby,” David said. “When I knew I was getting out, he wanted me to leave all my art supplies behind. I said ‘No, I’m not leaving my stuff behind. I’m still going to do this when I get out.’”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers seeking to slow down annual minimum wage increases that Nebraska voters approved in 2022 have reached a new deal to avoid the law’s inflationary increases.
State Sens. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Stan Clouse of Kearney said they have found a “compromise” for Raybould’s Legislative Bill 258 that would completely remove permanent annual cost-of-living increases to the state minimum wage, beginning in 2027. 
Under the Clouse amendment, the wage would increase instead by 1.75% annually in perpetuity. Under the current law, workers could see much larger increases. Average inflation for the past five years was 4.18%. Over the past 10 years, it was 2.63%. And over the past 25 years, it was 2.39%, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Midwest.
“It’s certainty, and I like certainty, and I like minimizing the risk,” Clouse said at the beginning of April, when he pitched a fixed annual increase rather than a sliding scale tied to inflation.

Raybould said her motivation and why she keeps pushing “passionately” for her measure is to help small businesses and others who might not be able to absorb the cost of rising wages that she said could pass on costs to consumers.
“I know that this is the right thing to do, to create a balance,” Raybould said this week. “You have to always balance it out to make sure that we maintain the economic vitality and vibrancy and economic growth in our state without falling off and creating a cycle of cost increases that are so much harder for Nebraska families to be able to afford.”
Clouse has said that unless his amendment has been attached to LB 258 before the end of the next four-hour debate on LB 258, he will not vote for the measure. His vote matters because overcoming a filibuster requires 33 votes, and Clouse is likely Raybould’s 33rd vote. 
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln has filed multiple motions and amendments to try to prevent his amendment from being attached, one of the opponents who say Raybould’s bill goes against voters.


Minimum wage types

Federal minimum wage: Created in 1938, now $7.25.
Nebraska minimum wage: Created in 1967, now $13.50.
Nebraska tipped employees minimum wage: Created in 1970, now $2.13. Wages plus gratuities must equal or exceed the Nebraska minimum wage under state law.
Nebraska training wage: Created in 1991, now $5.44 (75% of the federal minimum wage) for up to the first 90 days of employment for a worker younger than 20 years old.
Nebraska student-learners minimum wage: Created in 1987, now $11.25 (75% of the Nebraska minimum wage) for workers who are part of a vocational training program.
Nebraska youth minimum wage: Does not currently exist.



Raybould’s amended proposal
Nebraska first enacted a state minimum wage of $1 in October 1967, 29 years after Congress passed a federal minimum wage, first at 25 cents for select workers. The federal minimum wage sets a floor for workers’ pay when state wages don’t keep up.
The Nebraska minimum wage did not overtake the federal minimum wage until voters acted in 2014, increasing it to $9 by January 2016.
In 2022, voters acted again and decided to permanently go around the Legislature, opting for annual $1.50 increases through 2026, up to $15, before shifting to annual cost-of-living adjustments.
Raybould, a longtime grocery store executive who was elected to the Legislature in 2022, first proposed capping annual minimum wage increases to up to 1.5% in 2023. Former State Sen. Tom Briese of Albion, now the state treasurer, had a separate measure seeking to amend the state training wage for teen workers, while also seeking to create a “youth minimum wage” for 14 or 15 year olds.
The training wage was first established in July 1991, allowing employers to pay workers younger than 20 a lower wage for up to the first 90 days of employment. The wage expired after March 1993 but returned in September 1997.
LB 258 would exempt 14 or 15 year olds from the training wage but create a subminimum wage for the youngest workers that could stay in place until they age out.
Raybould’s version of the original Briese proposal, in LB 258, includes the following:

The training wage would be limited to teen workers ages 16 to 19. It would rise to $13.50 this September and, beginning in 2027, increase by 1.5% each year. The training wage in Nebraska has been tied to 75% of the federal minimum wage since 2007. With the $7.25 federal wage not increasing since 2009, the training wage has been locked at $5.44.
The youth minimum wage would be created for 14 or 15 year olds, exempting them from the training wage. It would start at $13.50 in January 2026 and increase every fifth year by 1.5%.

The state minimum wage for adults and older teens would rise by 2065 to $29.51 under Clouse’s amendment. That’s the same point at which the new youth minimum wage would finally catch up to the $15 baseline wage that voters approved for all Nebraska workers in 2022, starting next year, based on an analysis by the Nebraska Examiner of the impact of the Clouse and Raybould language.



The disparity between the state minimum wage and the youth wage would grow over time, from about 90% of the state wage in 2026 to about half of the Nebraska rate by 2065. That’s young workers born after 2050.
The training wage would be $24.13 in 2065, or about 82% of the state minimum wage. Raybould said it’s critical to correct an “oversight” from past legislation and ballot measures that left out increases to the training wage and sever that wage from the stagnant federal rate.
OSHA and emancipated minors
Emancipated minors would be paid the full state minimum wage as older workers, which Raybould and supporters have said would help some young parents or youths who need the most support.

However, very few minors are granted emancipation, according to court data that Conrad requested and shared with the Examiner. In the report, 143 emancipation cases were filed with the judicial system, dating back to 2019 and including the early part of 2025.
Over that period, the court system granted 65 youths emancipation, and eight more cases were pending. It’s unclear how many of those minors were 14 or 15 years old. 
Local businesses sought to employ 2,874 teens aged 14 or 15 in 2022, according to a March 2023 Nebraska Department of Labor report.
Raybould said she continues pushing for the youth minimum wage partly because of child labor laws that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration helps enforce. Under the requirements, a 14- or 15-year-old can only perform certain non-hazardous or non-manufacturing duties or work certain hours. Businesses face severe penalties for noncompliance.
These teen workers can’t work more than three hours on a school day or more than 18 hours during a school week. Work hours are restricted between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., except around the summer when night hours are extended to 9 p.m.
Raybould said she’s heard from many business leaders who say they would hire 14- or 15-year-old workers but that the same minimum wage coupled with OSHA restrictions is a disincentive for doing so. 
  State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. Dec. 7, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
She said her family, which operates B&R Stores, Inc., the parent company of Super Saver, Russ’s Market and other local grocery stores, hasn’t hired those youngest workers for about 20 years “for the very reason of the equipment and things they are not permitted to do.”
If the youth wage were established, she said some businesses might reconsider hiring young workers. However, she said her grocery stores wouldn’t because of “too many restrictions.”
Raybould retired as vice president of her family company, founded in 1964, at the end of March. She continues to serve as vice chair of the company board and has filed a conflict of interest statement on her measure.
LB 258 would not be the final say on minimum wage, Raybould added, as future lawmakers or voters could still act. She noted employers also would not be prohibited from paying more than the minimum wage or from not adopting training or youth wages. She said she realizes workers, during a workforce shortage, are looking for competitive wages, benefits and hours.
Raybould’s bill would not change the $2.13 minimum hourly wage paid to workers earning tips or gratuities, which hasn’t changed since 1991.
‘Basic civics’
Conrad, who helped run the 2014 ballot measure that brought the state minimum wage above the federal rate, and State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who helped lead the 2022 measure, have led opposition to Raybould this spring. All three are Democrats, with Raybould standing alone among her progressive colleagues in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.
Much of the opposition cites the “will of the voters” in 2022, when the McKinney-backed measure secured about 59% support statewide and majority support in 38 of 49 legislative districts.

Conrad blasted the creation of a youth wage as viewing young workers as “subhuman” and urged Raybould to show where in her campaign she said she would “stick it to low-income working families.”
“The frustration is that you shouldn’t have to explain basic civics to adult state senators,” Conrad said during the earlier debate.
As a freshman lawmaker in 2007, Conrad helped keep the state minimum wage on track with the federal minimum wage after a last-minute emergency congressional spending bill, focused on disaster relief for Hurricane Katrina and funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, passed with minimum wage increases.
The first bill Conrad ever introduced, in 2007, sought to increase the state minimum wage and seek regular inflationary changes, while also increasing and narrowing the state training wage and tying the tipped-worker wage to 50% of the state minimum wage. 
One of the lobbyists opposing that bill is now a freshman senator, State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse. He was representing the National Federation of Independent Business.
A much-narrowed version of Conrad’s bill came to fruition at the tail-end of the 2007 legislative session, which inadvertently led to a temporary 53-day decrease in the state training wage because of differences in the timing of the state and federal laws taking effect, a hiccup that was added when Conrad’s bill was amended into a similar bill.



‘Stuck in a cycle’
Speaking with the Examiner this week, Conrad said the debate needs to remain focused on voters and low-income families or low-income working young people, who she said would be most hurt by LB 258.
“Anything that has caused us to lose sight of the true impacts of these harmful measures is a distraction, and if Senator Raybould wants to perpetuate some sort of personal attacks or can’t defend her own position in financial conflict, that’s on her,” Conrad said. “Senator Raybould is not a victim.”
Conrad said she and Raybould have been friends for a long time and agree on more than they disagree. While this “sharp disagreement … is painful for both of us,” Conrad said she continues to consider Raybould a friend.

McKinney has said a “common theme” of the 2025 session so far has been to go against voters, whether it be weakening paid sick leave, medical cannabis or minimum wage measures. He called it “sad, to say the least.” He unsuccessfully tried to raise the state minimum wage with legislation in 2021, before leading the 2022 ballot measure.
“When you have stagnant wages, you have people stuck in a cycle,” McKinney said during the previous debate. “And then you have people telling people to pull yourselves up by your bootstraps, do all these things, but we have stagnant wages.”
Raybould has described her bill as exercising the Legislature’s referendum power to modify, amend or repeal voter-enacted laws. 
‘A very temporary measure’
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, who chairs the Business and Labor Committee that advanced Raybould’s bill, said she was very much against the Raybould and Briese ideas when the youth minimum wage would have applied to 16 or 17 year olds.
Once Raybould limited the youth minimum wage to 14 or 15 year olds, citing the federal restrictions, Kauth came on board.
“Raising the minimum wage does nothing more than a very temporary measure to make you feel good for a little bit,” Kauth said.

She continued: “If you have not improved your skills, you haven’t taken on more responsibility, got more education, or done something to differentiate yourself and improve, then everybody’s going to just kind of float at that same level and everything becomes more expensive.”
Looming reelection decision
Next year, Raybould will have a choice to make on whether she runs for reelection, but she said she has “never cared, not ever” about whether she is reelected. Instead, she said she cares about “doing the right thing every day for the right reasons that help the most Nebraskans.”
She said she’s heard from constituents who have thanked her for the measure, as well as others who have called her self-serving, self-centered and selfish. Of the hits, she said, “I just have to take those.”
Raybould said her constituents know her, that she is informed and does her “homework,” and that her 2026 reelection decision is up to central Lincoln voters. She previously served four years as a Lancaster County commissioner and eight years as a member of the Lincoln City Council, and she was the Democratic candidate in 2018 against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.
“It’s really up to them to make that decision if they want me to run again or if they want someone else,” Raybould said. “And if they want someone else, I would support that too.”



Eligibility for the Nebraska, federal minimum wage
The federal minimum wage did not apply to most workers until 1978:

In October 1938, the wage went into effect for employees engaged in interstate commerce or in producing goods for interstate commerce.
Beginning September 1961, at a slightly lower rate than interstate commerce employees, the wage extended to workers of large retail or service enterprises, as well as those in local transit, construction or gas stations.
By February 1967, state or local government employees in hospitals, nursing homes and schools, as well as workers in laundries, dry cleaners and large hotels, motels, restaurants or farms were covered. Between 1970 and 1978, farm workers were paid at a lower rate.
Beginning January 1978, the federal minimum wage extended to most nonexempt workers at one minimum wage, $2.65 at the time.

Nebraska created a state minimum wage in 1967, applying in that case to workers not covered by the federal minimum wage until 1978. The Nebraska minimum wage has now surpassed the federal minimum wage and must be paid to all workers in businesses employing four or more employees. For smaller businesses, the federal minimum wage must be paid.

Skaug, a Nampa Republican, supported two bills this legislative session taking aim at marijuana use: one to impose a mandatory minimum $300 fine for possession and another that would take away the right of voters to legalize pot at the ballot box.
He believes other states are starting to regret liberalizing marijuana use, because of potential health concerns and lackluster revenues from marijuana sales.
“Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it’s not improved their states as a place to raise a family, to do business,” he said. “It just hasn’t come through with the promises that we heard years ago for those states.”
Idaho’s not alone. After years of expanding legal access, lawmakers in several states this year have targeted marijuana in various ways.
To help close budget gaps, officials in Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey have proposed raising marijuana taxes. Health concerns have pushed lawmakers in states including Colorado and Montana to attempt to cap the level of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, in marijuana products sold at dispensaries. And some lawmakers have even tried to roll back voter-approved medical marijuana programs.













Looking around at other states that have legalized marijuana, it's not improved their states.


– Idaho Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug





“This year in particular, we’re playing defense a lot more than we have in the past,” said Morgan Fox, political director at the advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML.
To some extent, he said, the pendulum on marijuana liberalization is swinging back. But Fox said recent legislative efforts are not indicative of waning public support for legalization. He said prohibitionist politicians have been emboldened to act against the will of voters.
 Polling shows most adults say cannabis should be legal for medical, recreational use

Polling from the Pew Research Center has found little change in support for legalization in recent years: 57% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational purposes.
Colorado and Washington state began allowing recreational marijuana sales in 2014. Today, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational sales, and 39 states and the district have sanctioned medical marijuana.
“There’s been this air of inevitability for a while,” said Daniel Mallinson, an associate professor of public policy at Penn State Harrisburg who researches marijuana legalization.
With medical marijuana programs operational in most states, Mallinson said there is pressure to expand recreational marijuana, especially given uncertainty over whether the federal government will act on the issue.
“Recreational is still in its takeoff period,” he said.
But he acknowledged that new medical research has raised concerns among some lawmakers. One study published in January found a link between heavy marijuana use and memory function. Other studies have found a higher risk of heart attacks among people who use cannabis.
Mallinson said the research on marijuana is “very young,” as many institutions are wary of conducting clinical trials because of federal drug laws. The federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug — the same classification as drugs such as heroin and ecstasy.
“There’s a mixture of science and politics in this area,” he said. “ … I could imagine seeing in these really conservative states like Idaho, you know, this kind of a backlash, like, we don’t want this here at all, so we’re going to try to put up barriers to even considering it.”
 A debate headed for the ballot

In Idaho, Skaug said he pursued the state’s new mandatory $300 fine for marijuana possession to bring more consistency to how the state handles marijuana cases.
While Idaho law previously allowed fines of up to $1,000, he said judges had issued fines as low as $2.50.

“So that wasn’t the right message. That’s not even worth the time to write the ticket,” he said. “So it’s not that we’re going to arrest more people for misdemeanor possession of marijuana, but there will be more citations in the amount of $300.”
Skaug also backed a proposed constitutional amendment that would give only the Legislature the power to legalize marijuana and other drugs. That question will go to voters next year.
Skaug said he’s worried outside groups would influence a public vote to legalize marijuana by pouring millions into a ballot initiative campaign. If the amendment he supports passes, it wouldn’t ban pot — it would leave legalization up to lawmakers.
“If the evidence comes back that says marijuana or some other drug is positive in the medical community and a good thing, then the Legislature can legalize that,” he said. “But we’re going to leave it with the Legislature.”
Advocates have been trying without success to get enough signatures to put a medical marijuana question on the ballot for more than a decade in Idaho, said Democratic state Rep. Ilana Rubel. The House minority leader, Rubel said she hit “a firm brick wall” in pitching medical marijuana legislation in Boise, where GOP lawmakers privately tell her they don’t want to look soft on crime.

She views the proposed amendment as another example of the GOP super majority-controlled Statehouse being out of touch with regular Idahoans. She said the state’s closed Republican primaries have led to more conservative stances from lawmakers.
“This is one of those issues where there is just a huge, huge gap between what the people of Idaho want and what they’re going to get from their Legislature,” she said.
A 2022 poll commissioned by the Idaho Statesman found that nearly 70% of Idahoans supported legalizing medical marijuana.
But even discussions about medical marijuana are shut down in Idaho because of concerns about problems with drugs in liberal cities such as Portland and Seattle, Rubel said.
“A very large number of red states have legalized medical marijuana, and they haven’t seen any of the parade of horribles that has been presented whenever we introduce this idea,” she said. “There’s just a lot of hysteria and paranoia about where this is going to lead that is really not tied to reality.”
 Targeting marijuana potency, revenues

In several states, lawmakers have aimed to restrict the potency of marijuana products.
Montana state Sen. Greg Hertz, a Republican, said he doesn’t want to end recreational marijuana sales, which voters approved in 2020. But he said today’s products are much stronger than people may realize.
“People were voting for Woodstock weed, not this new high-THC marijuana,” he said.
A bill he sponsored this year would have banned sales of recreational marijuana products, including flower and edibles, exceeding THC levels of 15%. Montana currently allows up to 35% THC in flower, with no limit on other products.
That legislation stalled, but Hertz said he plans to pitch a similar measure during Montana’s next legislative session in 2027.
A separate bill reducing the state’s dosage of THC for edibles recently passed the Legislature. The measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, would change the individual dosage limit on edibles such as gummies from 10 milligrams to 5 milligrams.
Hertz said the state rushed into its liberalization of marijuana without fully understanding the consequences.
He pointed to state health department data showing rising emergency room visits related to marijuana and dozens of cannabis poisoning cases in recent years — including 36 involving children 10 years or younger.
“We probably opened up the barn door too wide,” he said. “I’m just trying to slow this down a little bit.”

With many states facing gaping budget holes this year, marijuana has proven a popular target from Democrats and Republicans looking to raise revenues without across-the-board tax increases.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore in January proposed hiking the cannabis tax from 9% to 15% to help close the state’s $3 billion budget hole. In March, lawmakers agreed to a budget framework that would raise the state marijuana tax to 12%.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine proposed doubling marijuana taxes from 10% to 20% — a notion that has so far faced opposition in the Legislature.
In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed a new 32% wholesale tax on marijuana growers to help fund road improvements. That tax would be on top of the 10% excise tax on recreational marijuana and the state’s 6% sales tax.
Whitmer said it would close a loophole that has exempted the marijuana industry from wholesale tax, which is applied to cigarettes and other tobacco products. Michigan lawmakers, split sharply along partisan lines, have until Sept. 30 to approve a state budget.
Lawmakers in some states have even taken aim at voter-approved medical marijuana programs this year.
In South Dakota, a bill that failed in committee would have gutted the medical marijuana program overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2020.
In November, Nebraska voters widely supported ballot measures to roll out a medical marijuana program — winning majority support in each of the state’s 49 legislative districts.
But setting up the regulatory scheme has proven controversial, the Nebraska Examiner reported. Lawmakers are pursuing legislation that would define which medical conditions and forms of cannabis would qualify.
Medical marijuana advocates say overly strict rules would hamper the program and undermine the will of voters. But some legislators insist on limitations to prevent widespread access to marijuana.
“We make it legal for anything and everything, it’s essentially recreational marijuana at that point,” state Sen. Rick Holdcroft, a Republican, told the Nebraska Examiner this month.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey)In the summer of 1959, the west Yellowstone region experienced one of the largest Rocky Mountain earthquakes in instrumented history.
The M7.3 Hebgen Lake earthquake caused severe damage and killed 28 people, most notably due to a landslide into a campground in Madison Canyon downstream from Hebgen dam. Here, roughly 30 million cubic meters (imagine 30 million washing machines!) of material from the north-facing slope of Madison Canyon came crashing down in the night, burying the campground and damming the Madison River to form Earthquake Lake.
We have learned a lot from destructive historic earthquakes like that at Hebgen Lake. The evidence it left on the landscape, such as fault scarps (steep breaks in slope where vertical displacement occurred along the fault), are especially important for understanding prehistoric earthquakes.
The study of such earthquakes, called paleoseismology, can help to better characterize earthquake-producing faults by providing information about the recurrence and magnitudes of past earthquakes.
  These are the epicenters of 6,188 earthquakes in the Hebgen Lake region since 1990 as determined by the University of Utah Seismograph Stations and the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology. All epicenters have horizontal uncertainties of 1.0 km or less. Black contour lines show subsidence (in 2-foot intervals) resulting from the 1959 M7.3 Hebgen Lake earthquake (epicenter shown by red star). Magenta line segments show faults that ruptured during the 1959 earthquake and green line segments are Late Quaternary faults from the USGS Quaternary Fault and Fold Database. (Courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey)
Lakes are becoming increasingly popular in paleoseismic studies. Their regular sedimentation patterns can refine earthquake-timing estimates and can potentially capture earthquakes that may not have ruptured the ground surface but still produced substantial ground shaking.
This subdiscipline is called lacustrine paleoseismology and has been typically practiced in deep, steep, glacially influenced lake systems, like those along the Teton Range to the south.
Because the impacts of the Hebgen Lake earthquake have been documented, a thorough understanding of how this earthquake affected nearby lake basins could teach us to interpret hidden earthquake records in different types of lakes — especially in shallow lakes with gentle slopes, like Henrys Lake just west of West Yellowstone in Idaho.
In the late winter of 2023, our team from the U.S. Geological Survey Geologic Hazards Science Center set out to Henrys Lake with the hypothesis that this shallow lake basin contains evidence of the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake. Because Henrys Lake is only about about 15 miles from the earthquake epicenter and therefore experienced strong to very strong shaking, it is fair to assume that lake sediment may have been disturbed.
To test this hypothesis, we extracted seven sediment cores, each about a little over 6 feet long, along an east-west transect across Henrys Lake during winter 2023. A benefit of working on lakes in the winter is that standing on solid (icy) ground can offer a steadier working environment than trying to collect sediment cores from a boat. Just like ice fishing, we used an ice auger to make a hole through the frozen lake surface and plunged the coring device into the water and then into the lake floor, keeping it leashed on a rope to pull it back up once the sediment was collected.
The cores were examined at the USGS Pacific Coastal Marine Science Center core lab, which is specially equipped for imaging and sampling sediment cores.
A common signature of earthquake disturbance within sediment cores results from sediment failure of the lake margin, transport downslope, and deposition in central areas of the lake basin. Cores from multiple locations in Henrys Lake contained a thin (2 inch), distinct, gray sandy layer in their upper portion that appeared to be a record of a recent earthquake.
The challenge was then to test if this layer matched the timing of the 1959 earthquake.
This was done by measuring the concentration of the chemical component Cesium-137 (137Cs) with depth. 137Cs was produced during atmospheric nuclear testing in the mid-20th century, so the concentration in sediment can be matched with the known frequency of nuclear testing through time to establish the age of the sediment layer.
For example, above ground nuclear testing increased around 1954, and the concentration of 137Cs in sediments starts to grow from undetectable levels to detectable that year. Conversely, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1963, so sediment of this age has peak 137Cs concentration that drastically drops immediately thereafter (which is toward the top of the core in the most recently deposited sediment).
These defined concentration levels should essentially bound the 1959 earthquake deposit in the sedimentary record!
So, what about that outstanding layer of sand hypothesized to be associated with the 1959 earthquake? When pairing the 137Cs concentration data with the sedimentological data, we found that the sand deposit was indeed bracketed between 1954 and 1963, providing solid evidence that this layer probably formed during the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake.
  This is a photo and graphic of the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake deposit in sediment core from Henrys Lake, Idaho, with references to Cesium-137 activity (or concentration). Changes in Cesium-137 are related to atmospheric nuclear tests and provide a means of dating the deposit; those measurements are plotted on the right with depth of the core. (Courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey)
With evidence that sediment at the bottom of Henrys Lake does, indeed, contain records of past earthquakes, the next goal was to look for other prehistoric earthquakes using the 1959 Hebgen Lake deposit as a reference.
However, there were no such similar deposits with the same sediment character and presence in multiple cores. Using radiocarbon dating techniques, we were able to establish that the very lowest portions of the cores were approximately 5,000 years old.
Does this mean that there have not been earthquakes similar in intensity to the Hebgen Lake earthquake in the last 5,000 years? Not exactly.
The lowermost layer of the cores — the 5,000-year-old layer — is consistent with deposits from a marshy wetland, not a lake at all! Marshy wetlands are saturated areas with a lot of plants and grasses that typically produce organic-rich soils and not finely layered sediment like lakes do, making them much less likely to record an earthquake.
Based on estimates of sedimentation rate, it appears that Henrys Lake likely only changed from a marshy wetland to a shallow lake less than about 1,000 years ago.
Although there is a lot more to explore about the specific evolution of Henrys Lake and other lakes in the west Yellowstone area, it is promising that a shallow lake with gentle sloping margins can record earthquake shaking. These findings provide increased confidence in our ability to investigate shaking-related deposits in other lakes with similar characteristics in the Rocky Mountain region or beyond.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)West Tennessee soybean farmers already on the heels of a tough year are now facing challenges posed by the remnants of early April floods.
Gina Ward’s low-lying fields near Rives and the Obion River flooded in February, requiring the third-generation farm to make costly repairs to the private levee attached to their land.
Just a few weeks later, the majority of the levee was once again washed away in a near-record-setting flood after rain drenched Northwest Tennessee and surrounding areas.
The 96-hour rain event was the second-highest for the Obion, Forked Deer and Loosahatchie Rivers, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
When the water finally began to recede from Ward’s drowned fields about 10 days later, it left craters and debris. 
“It looks like the surface of the moon now,” she said.
Soybeans cover more acres than any other row crop in Tennessee, according to the University of Tennessee. The crop is most popular in the state’s west and central regions.
April typically marks the beginning of the planting season. Ward had not yet planted her fields when the storms began on April 3, but she wants to get seeds in the ground as soon as possible to maximize her yield. 
She has started planting in fields on higher ground. But the sandy moonscape left behind by the flood in lower-lying areas will take a lot of time and work before it’s ready to be planted again, Ward said.

Stefan Maupin, executive director of the Tennessee Soybean Production Council, said most of the flooded land was not planted. 
“The farmers who farm that low-lying ground know that it’s best to wait as long as possible to get outside of flooding season before they start planting that ground,” he said.
But the flooding has pushed back their planting dates, which could lead to lower yields.
“Conventional wisdom in any farming is to get your crop in early, and that’s going to be a little difficult to do on hundreds of thousands of acres in these flood plains, because the water is going to have to go down, and the fields will have to dry,” Maupin said.
Field maintenance could also prove expensive and time-consuming for farmers whose fields were left littered with debris, covered in sediment or rutted by receding flood water.
These delays and extra expenses compound the losses soybean farmers saw in 2024.
Soybean prices paid to Tennessee producers dropped 16% in 2024 compared to 2023, despite farmers planting around 15% more acreage, according to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture. 
Like any other business, a farmer’s goal is to make a return on their investment, and planting requires significant capital up front, Maupin said. Profit margins are thin due to high interest rates and inflated costs for things like fuel, fertilizer, and pesticides. 
“Last year they had no profit in corn, wheat, soybeans and cotton, and they lost a lot of money,” he said. “This year, the prices and the input costs are not any better, so they needed to be able to reduce their costs as much as possible. For those who farm in these flooded areas, it is only going to drive up their costs to put a crop there.”

Since 2000, the United States has seen a dramatic rise in drug overdose-related deaths, including prescription opioids. According to data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, drug-involved overdoses have doubled since 2015, with approximately 107,000 people dying from a drug-involved overdose. 
Need to get rid of old prescriptions? East Idaho drop off sites open April 26.

Opioid-related deaths aren’t just in the streets of Stockton or the alleyways of Portland, but rather, opioid death touches the lives of everyone in our community. 
These numbers are rising as the opioid epidemic continues to affect communities across the country — and Idaho is not immune. According to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, in 2022, there were 270 opioid-related deaths across the state and 755 emergency room visits relating to an opioid overdose emergency.
Opioids are often referred to as narcotics and are medications that doctors prescribe to alleviate pain. There are many types of prescribed opioids, such as codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxymorphone and morphine. 
They are used by people of all ages and walks of life for those suffering from ailments, recovering from an injury or surgery, and needing relief from pain. As we have seen the opioid epidemic sweep across the country, we know opioids can be highly addictive and highly devastating. 
When opioids are used to manage pain for long periods, the risk of addiction rises. A prolonged period of taking opioids puts a person at risk of relying on the drug for survival. This problem is more common than it seems, with opioid overdoses taking the lives of 90 people by accident daily, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
Idaho’s youth is no exception to this epidemic. According to the Idaho Healthy Youth Survey, most Idaho students do not misuse prescription drugs. However, of those that do, 72.8% of them said they misuse pain relievers, 30.7% misuse depressants and 30.7% misuse stimulants. Additionally, students who misuse prescription drugs say they do so within their own homes. 
Blue Cross of Idaho and the Meridian Anti-Drug Coalition are proud to partner for the sixth time to host Prescription Drug Take-Back Day. Since 2018, our annual partnership has safely disposed of approximately 1.9 tons of unwanted medication. 
On April 27, 2024, bring all your old, expired, and unwanted medications to Blue Cross of Idaho’s headquarters in Meridian to safely dispose of these substances. Our event is an opportunity to clean out that medicine cabinet and see what is expired and should be disposed of before possibly getting into the wrong hands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration noted that take-back programs are the best way to dispose of unused or expired prescriptions and over-the-counter medicines safely. 
Opioid addiction and abuse know no bounds to who it affects; addiction does not discriminate, affecting all ages and backgrounds. It is a disease that affects families, friends, neighbors, and people we love, and maybe has affected us personally.
Join us in making a positive and long-lasting effect on our community and potentially saving a life by turning in your household prescription medications.

Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those (attempts) are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.

Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Recently, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states, including Colorado, adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) Anyone with concerns about handling the manure from 25,000 cows or other issues associated with what could become North Dakota’s largest dairy are now able to submit comments to the state. 
The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality opened a comment period Friday on the proposed Traill County facility to be operated by Minnesota-based Riverview Dairy. 
The DEQ comment period runs through June 2 and includes a public hearing May 20 from 5-8 p.m. at the Hillsboro High School gym. Comments can be submitted through the DEQ website at deq.nd.gov/PublicNotice.aspx.
Riverview refers to the 25,000-cow project as Herberg Dairy, named for the township along the Red River and North Dakota Highway 200 southeast of Hillsboro where the dairy is planned. 
Riverview already has a state environmental permit for its planned 12,500-cow dairy in Abercrombie Township north of Wahpeton in Richland County. The Dakota Resource Council is challenging that permit in court.

Marty Haroldson, permits program manager of the Division of Water Quality within the Department of Environmental Quality, and other staff members from the agency were in Hillsboro earlier this month as Riverview held an open house to answer questions from the public. 
Haroldson said the plan for the Herberg Dairy is similar to Abercrombie, just on a larger scale. 
“So as far as the technology, that’s all the same, it’s just scaled up,” Haroldson said. “Manure storage ponds are going to have a larger footprint, the barns are going to be a little bit bigger, a few more people working there.” 
Haroldson said even after an environmental permit is issued, some aspects of the plan, such as manure management, can change, such as which farmers want to use Riverview’s manure as fertilizer or on which fields. 
The plan “can be a living document,” Haroldson said, but Riverview would need to document the changes. 
Water sources, processing
Two large questions are not addressed in the environmental plans for the dairy: Where will the water come from? Where will the milk go? 
Large dairy farms like the ones proposed by Minnesota-based Riverview Dairy require huge quantities of water — 20 to 30 gallons of water per cow per day. 
That would equal at least 700,000 gallons of water per day for the Traill County site and 350,000 gallons per day for the Richland County site.
The huge water need coupled with manure output from such a large dairy has some residents in Richland County concerned about the effect on aquifers and the water supply for residents. 
Huge dairy farms planned for eastern North Dakota

Brady Janzen, who works on site development for Riverview Dairy, said during a recent open house on the Traill County project that the company’s dairies use a combination of collected water, such as gathering rain water that runs off barn roofs, surface water and ground water. 
Riverview has a permit request under review with the North Dakota Department of Water Resources for the Richland County site northwest of Wahpeton for using surface water pulled from the Red River.  
A comment period has already been held on that permit. Another comment period will open when the department announces its intent to approve or deny the permit. 
Riverview is working with the East Central Rural Water District that serves Traill and Grand Forks counties for the site southeast of Hillsboro.  Riverview has not yet applied for a water permit for that site. 
The two dairies will use a lot of water and produce a lot of milk that would need to be processed.  The Traill dairy would fill 22 tanker loads of milk – more than 170,000 gallons per day. The Richland site would produce about half that.
“We won’t begin building until we have a processor who has a need for that milk,” Janzen said. 
Riverview already has several large dairies in western Minnesota but does not own its own creamery.
Janzen said Riverview has “kicked the tires” on building a processing plant.

Dairy farmers in the Bismarck-Mandan area, the traditional heart of North Dakota’s dairy industry, have been hurt by the closure of a creamery close to home. 
A bill in the North Dakota Legislature aims to provide some financial incentives for dairy processing. 
Amber Wood of the North Dakota Livestock Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes animal agriculture, is confident that the large dairies will mean more processing in the area.
“With dairy, it’s not the chicken or the egg, it’s the chicken and the egg,” Wood said. “You have to have processing to get cows and cows to get processing.” 
Raising concerns
While Wood is optimistic about dairy in the Red River Valley, others have concerns.

The same evening as Riverview’s Hillsboro open house, the Dakota Resource Council hosted a meeting in Fargo to raise awareness of the Abercrombie Dairy, which would be near the Red River, the drinking water source for Fargo residents.
“So why should you care? Because you’re 35 miles away,” said Madeline Luke, a volunteer with Dakota Resource Council whose main interest is in water protection, told the group. 
Luke said by the time the public became aware of the Abercrombie Dairy, there was little time to review the permit application within the comment period. She cited concerns such as the number of fields where the manure will be applied that have drainage tile installed. 
Luke was already reviewing the Herberg application on Friday.

Erik Olson has become a spokesperson for Abercrombie-area residents opposed to the dairy and addressed the Fargo meeting. The town of Abercrombie is less than four miles from the proposed dairy. 
“Riverview was well into the process of planning and developing for years before the public was made aware,” Olson said. “We have minimal time to learn and educate ourselves on the effects that this megadairy would be having.
“To say that we were shocked is an understatement.” 
The Dakota Resource Council has argued that one reason to throw out the permit is that there was no public hearing. 
Riverview has filed a motion to dismiss the Dakota Resource Council lawsuit. A ruling on that motion is pending with a Burleigh County court.

And a resounding 77% of respondents strongly agreed that focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace is a “good thing.” 
The findings are part of a data-driven effort by the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce to spotlight gaps in meeting expectations of college-educated and high skilled professionals so that employers and policymakers can reverse the “brain drain” trend that has troubled the state.
 ‘Starting point’

About 700 people chose to respond to the questionnaire, which was marketed and made publicly available in the eight-county area served by the chamber. The bulk of those who participated, 86%, had at least a bachelor’s degree. Nearly 75% were white.
Done in partnership with the University of Nebraska at Omaha-based Center for Public Affairs Research, the survey was conducted in 2024 and results were presented to chamber leaders in January. But the findings are now starting to be more widely discussed. 
On Monday, UNO researchers will explain highlights to a gathering at the chamber that is expected to draw young professionals, business and other leaders.
“The more we know about what talent is seeking and wanting, the more we can key in and help elevate what is going on already — or help support improvements,” said Merrick Brtek, director of the chamber’s Young Professionals & Talent Development Programs. “Is it going to fix everything? No. But it is a starting point for us to move forward with that feedback.”
For example, she said, the chamber runs a program introducing newcomers and others to area resources, including information on Omaha’s rapid bus transit system and how to get a daily Heartland Bike Share pass. About 73% of respondents said they were somewhat or extremely dissatisfied with transit options within the region.

The chamber thinks the modern-day streetcar, which has been controversial, will help and be welcomed by young professionals once its downtown-to-midtown Omaha route opens, Brtek said.
Other transit-related concerns also stood out, however. For example, 56% of respondents were somewhat or extremely dissatisfied with available transit options (such as bus, train or plane) from the Omaha area to other regions like Denver, Chicago, Kansas City or Lincoln.
When it came to walk and bike friendly commutes, only 35% who participated marked extremely or somewhat satisfied.
Brtek said she was pleased to see that the bulk of participants gave a high rating to overall quality of life. About 88% said they were somewhat or extremely satisfied. 
About 69% said the same about overall cost of living, though 60% said they were dissatisfied with the cost of taxes, such as sales, income and property.
 Hybrid over remote work

Among the more surprising nuggets to Brtek was the preference that respondents had for a hybrid but primarily in-person work environment, versus more remote.
“It’s exciting that people want that community aspect — to come together, connect and collaborate,” she said.
When asked to choose which work environment was most appealing, 32% marked the hybrid but primarily in-person choice; 28% marked hybrid but equally split between in-person and remote; 19% said hybrid, primarily remote; 11% said fully in person and 10% said fully remote.

Josie Schafer, head of the UNO research team that worked on the survey, said the survey dovetails with another done in 2019 that tracked down and asked questions of high-skilled professionals who had already left the area. In that study, 78% said that they fled for professional growth and development.
It’s not that jobs weren’t available locally, said Schafer, but “density” was lacking. Participants in the earlier survey felt there was not enough upward movement in companies where top management already was set as part of a family or established network.
This latest survey, on the other hand, was focused on young professionals who currently live and work in the area.
Schafer said only about 12% said they were not satisfied with their job overall. The lowest rated workplace factor was pay, followed by opportunity for advancement at work, she said. 
“Inflation has gone up faster than wages in the Omaha area, people are feeling wage pressure, so pay is a real issue for folks,” Schafer said.
When asked which job benefits were most important, a top answer besides salary was paid time off for sickness and  vacations. 
Most respondents said they weren’t likely to try to leave their current job in the next year. But when asked if they did choose to leave, about half said they’d probably leave Nebraska completely.
Top destination states mentioned were Colorado, Illinois, California, and Texas.
‘Quality of life’
“That is concerning,” Schafer said of brain-drain, or high-skilled people with a college education exiting Husker territory for other states. She said that domestic out-migration has been a “persistent issue for at least 15 years.”

Housing opportunities also stood out as a weakness, she said. About 53% of participants said they were either extremely or somewhat dissatisfied with rental or for-sale housing that meets their size and quality needs.
Among community-centric areas of the greater Omaha area that got the highest “extremely satisfied” marks: entertainment, restaurants and bars (41%); health care services (39%): quality of educational institutions (35%) and overall quality of life (31%).
Schafer will be sharing and discussing specifics of the survey findings at the Monday gathering.
“I don’t know that we’re taking enough steps to actually create the job opportunities that keep people here or the culture of organizations that keep people here,” she said, “Or the quality of life that makes people say, ‘It is worth the difference in pay to stay here.'”



 In their own words 

Among comments survey participants took the time to write:

“City council meetings are poorly placed. I would love to get involved but Tuesday at 2 p.m. assures the city only hears business owners, retired folks and those with a flexible schedule to attend. Given the perspective of politics these days, I believe this is by design to keep common folks from participation.”
“The divide on access to services/programs and basic needs is widening. Middle income is increasingly strained and state Legislature is focused on relief for highest and lowest income earners.”
“I like the flexibility. I don’t like that most of the work is remote. It makes it hard to communicate with coworkers and get to know them.”
“When I started in 2021, the benefits system wouldn’t let me register for benefits because it said my same sex marriage wasn’t valid. Management and up regularly misgender me (I use they/them pronouns). The person who has committed the most microaggressions and discriminatory actions is our only HR person.”
“The culture of fun and employee engagement never recovered from COVID.”
“We have got to increase wages; set rental price caps; develop, enact and implement renter protections; stop with all the bars, create spaces where families are welcome but not specifically children spaces; create real public transit and incentivize environmentally conscious transportation options, repair the roads meaningfully so our cars don ‘t get eaten by potholes and we have to pay to repair our cars more frequently; do actual policy work that is going to get people to have a POSITIVE identity with Omaha.”

House Republicans want to change who has the power to appoint the state’s superintendent of public instruction — potentially stripping the State Board of Education of one of its key functions — because they say Michigan’s education system is failing.
A House joint resolution seeks to alter the state’s constitution to give the governor control over the appointment, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The proposal comes as the state’s current superintendent is set to retire in the fall and, if it passed, would go into effect after Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s term ends.
The State Board of Education currently has the sole hiring and firing power for the position. The elected body has held that authority since 1963.
The resolution is tied to a bill that would require state board seats to be elected from geographic districts. Board seats are currently at-large, meaning whichever candidate wins the most votes wins the election, no matter where they live.
Democrats have controlled the board for much of the last two decades.
The Republican members of the House education committee voted to move the proposals forward to a vote in the full legislative body.
In order to become law, the resolution would have to be approved by two-thirds of the Republican-controlled House and the Democratically controlled Senate. It would then go before voters in the November 2026 election. If passed into law by a majority of voters, the new regulations would go into effect after Jan. 1, 2027.
Under the proposal, the state superintendent would serve a term of up to four years, as determined by the governor.
The current law allows state superintendents to remain in their positions either until they resign or are removed by the state board.
Current State Superintendent Michael Rice has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats — including Whitmer — for the lagging academic performance of schools in the state. He will leave his position Oct. 3, and the state board has already begun its search for his successor.
“Clearly, what we are doing is not working,” said state Rep. Bill Schuette, a Republican from Gladwin County, citing the state’s results on recent state and national assessments during a recent House Education and Workforce Committee hearing.
“You look across the country, we are one of the only states that has a so-called independent head of its education department, and I believe that this, in practice, has removed an important element of accountability from our state’s public education system,” Schuette added.
Rep. Regina Weiss, a Democrat from Oak Park, said during the hearing there are concerns the position could become more partisan if the change is made because the State Board of Education’s staggered eight-year terms offer more consistency.
Schuette argued that because governors are elected every four years, there would be more accountability to constituents.
“If you have a governor who wants to implement reforms or changes, and that person has a mandate directly from the people and the governor, I think that it is a better way to execute that accountability,” he said.
Schutte said he is also in favor of eliminating the state board entirely, though there are no formal proposals to do so yet.
The state board’s power has been reduced significantly over the years, particularly under the initiatives of former Gov. John Engler, a Republican who transferred a number of the board’s responsibilities to the state superintendent.
Currently, the board’s role is to establish academic standards, as well as make policy recommendations to local districts and lawmakers. It does not have the power to pass laws or to control school funding.
This month, the state board unanimously passed a resolution to oppose the proposal to strip it of its power to appoint the state superintendent.
The members agreed the potential for state education policy to change frequently due to “short-term, flashy” initiatives of new governors would cause “confusion and frustration” among school leaders.
Tom McMillin, a Republican member of the state board, said during the meeting that he’s long opposed previous efforts to shift the power of appointing the state superintendent to the governor.
“The architects of Michigan’s 1963 constitution were wise to recognize that giving too much power to the governor would be harmful and that providing authority and oversight of education to a separately elected board would be beneficial to Michigan’s children,” McMillin said in a statement. “This separation of power should remain.”

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle | Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.











The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology



Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)When examining the state of national politics and the federal government, there’s much to be concerned about, including President Donald Trump’s enthusiasm for deporting people legally in the country — and possibly, in the near future, U.S. citizens.
Concerned about freedom of the press? You might find it hard not to be if you note the Trump administration tried to ban the Associated Press — the gold standard for professional and fair journalism — from press conferences and has inserted right- wing bloggers in order to get favorable coverage.
It’s easy to get caught up in the doom spiral of national news, but Tennesseans would be better served, if no less sane, by turning from the scary and shiny objects in Washington, D.C., and back towards home, where members of the Tennessee General Assembly eagerly pursue a similarly anti-democratic agenda. 
Monitoring the actions of state lawmakers won’t make you feel less frustrated, but you have greater access to state representatives and senators near you to voice your concerns. 
Anti-immigration measures take priority
Gov. Bill Lee called a special legislative session in January presumably to push his universal school voucher program, but many political observers were surprised when Lee also added to his agenda three other items — in itself unusual, as special sessions are customarily devoted to one topic.
While vouchers remained a priority, almost as much attention was given to what Lee termed his “illegal immigration agenda.”

The legislature created a state immigration agency that would be exempt from public records law, a measure allowing public officials to be prosecuted if they vote for sanctuary city policies — which is unconstitutional, to say nothing of fact sanctuary cities have been illegal in Tennessee since 2018 — and requires immigrants in the state without permanent legal status to have driver’s licenses that mark them as such. 
“The Nazi Germans did this to the Jews,” said Democratic Sen. Charlane Oliver of Nashville, referring to the Star of David sewn into clothing.
Did Republican lawmakers go far enough to make immigrants feel harassed and unwelcome? Apparently not.
As soon as the special session ended and the regular one got into full swing, Republican lawmakers began filing anti-immigrant bills right and left, including: 

Senate Bill 227/House Bill 11: Sponsored by Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis and Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern, the bill would hold churches and charitable organizations liable for providing housing aid to immigrants without legal status — who then go on to commit a crime. It has passed both chambers and is set to become law. 
Senate bill 836/House Bill 793 : Sen. Bo Watson, a Chattanooga Republican, is carrying a piece of legislation that would require public schools to verify the immigration status of Tennessee’s nearly 1 million students and would give schools the option of charging students without permanent legal status tuition or denying them an education. The House version, sponsored by Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland, hit snags and may not pass. 
Senate Bill 1087 /House Bill 0177: A bill making it a crime for immigrants without legal status to remain in the state for more than 72 hours stalled out in the Senate and was deferred until 2026. Senate sponsor Jack Johnson of Franklin acknowledged the measure is unconstitutional — although that has rarely stopped lawmakers with a bee in their collective bonnet. 

Media matters
The year has been marked by fewer large-scale protests in the Capitol than the two years prior, but plenty of small protests — there have been more disruptions in committee meetings than Comcast has during spring storms — and on several occasions, women protesting against anti-immigration measures have been carried out by Tennessee state troopers. 
But sometimes, even members of the media are challenged trying to cover proceedings. 
For some years, reporters have been able to freely enter the House of Representatives, as long as they stationed themselves behind a dingy plexiglass barrier near the dais, separating them from the power brokers.

No more. Now, reporters must be on a list guarded by House sergeants-at-arms, and even reporters who are members of the Capitol Hill Press Corps can’t count on being listed. At times in the last two years, Lookout reporters have been turned away despite being recognized by officials working the door, requiring a direct call from the chair of the Capitol Hill Press Corps to gain entry. 
And earlier this month, members of the media were denied access to the Senate gallery. A spokesman for Lt. Gov. Randy McNally said troopers who provide security and sergeants-at-arms were concerned about “exceptional interest in the day’s proceedings” and turned media away as gallery capacity was reached. 
In that instance, McNally’s staff did, within minutes, take steps to allow reporters and photographers into the gallery. 
But it shouldn’t be that difficult for reporters to be able to enter public chambers to do their jobs.
Is this a chicken or egg issue? Are Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers emboldened by Trump’s example or would they have arrived at these steps on their own? That’s hard to say, since Trump’s influence has permeated Republican-led legislators for nine years — only six years after Republicans became the Tennessee Legislature’s supermajority. 
And I’m not sure the genesis matters, because here we are. But for Tennesseans who are weary of the flood of national bad news and a feeling of helplessness, there’s a cure of sorts. Turn your TV off, look away from Washington, D.C., and turn your sights to home — where your vote has a more direct impact on those same Trump-like policies and those perpetrating them.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.

Like bringing back smoking rooms to Montana businesses.
This is what Senate Bill 150, now being debated by the Montana Legislature, stands to do.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Wylie Galt of Martinsdale, would weaken Montana’s 20-year-old Clean Indoor Air Act and allow so-called “cigar rooms” to operate in our state. If the idea sounds familiar, that’s because lawmakers have rejected it time after time in past legislative sessions. But those who put profits ahead of our health keep trying.
SB 150 will subject employees and non-smoking patrons to secondhand cigar smoke, which can cause lung cancer and heart disease and stroke, and which contains all the same toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. Every worker deserves a safe place to work – free of toxic air pollutants.
If passed, Galt’s bill as proposed with amendments will irreparably weaken our Clean Indoor Air Act, which, as stated in Montana law, is intended to “protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; to recognize the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air; and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air has priority over the desire to smoke.”
There is no way to contain cigar smoke within a room or building. Smoke filters through cracks in windows and walls, through air ducts and even through electrical outlets. And there is no safe level of secondhand smoke exposure. If bars or brewpubs have “cigar rooms,” everyone inside the building, not just the smoking area itself, will be at risk, just as they were back in the bad old days when smoking was allowed in restaurants and on board airplanes. Say “so long” to the family environment many establishments have cultivated during the past two decades. Many Montanans may see their favorite spots opting in to allow smoking.
There is no ventilation system that can effectively protect against secondhand smoke. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, which sets engineering standards for ventilation systems, says that “the only means of effectively eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to ban smoking activity” from a building. Ventilation may reduce odor, but it won’t protect people’s health.
In fact, people who go inside a cigar bar or room will be at risk even when smoking isn’t taking place. Toxins from cigar smoke seep into carpet, furniture and walls and can be absorbed through the skin or by breathing in contaminated dust or by eating contaminated food. Employees charged with cleaning or otherwise maintaining a cigar bar or room will be at risk. Cigar bars or rooms can even pose a hazard for neighboring businesses.
Not only are backers of SB 150 and its amendment undermining our health and the Clean Indoor Air Act, but they also are breaking a promise made to the people of Montana. When the Clean Indoor Air Act was adopted 20 years ago, it included a four-year phase-in period for Montana’s tavern owners to make their bars and casinos smokefree. The phase-in was agreed upon by the tavern industry, legislators and some health groups. SB 150 breaks this promise, which has been held for 16 years.
The bill also runs counter to public opinion in our state. A 2021 poll by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the American Heart Association showed that 89% of Montana voters from across the political spectrum support the Clean Indoor Air Act, and 77% (3-in-4) of Montana voters oppose allowing cigar smoking in bars.
SB 150 breaks a promise made to Montana citizens and hospitality workers, and it undermines our Clean Indoor Air Act, which prevents disease and saves lives. We’ve had 20 years of smokefree workplaces and 16 years of smokefree bars and casinos. Why bring back the days of smoke-filled air and coming home with your clothes, skin and hair stinking of smoke?
We’ve come to expect clean, healthy air in our public spaces. Let’s not go back to the days of smoking rooms.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cigar-in-ashtray-861x535-1.jpg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

(Photo by Javeria Salman/The Hechinger Report)This story is part of Hechinger’s ongoing coverage about rethinking high school. See our article about a new diploma in Alabama that trades chemistry for carpentry. 
LOUISVILLE — It had been a slow morning at the Class Act Federal Credit Union. But a little after 11 a.m., a client walked through the door. 
“Who’s waiting on me?” said the elderly man, smiling.
“I will,” said Gracie Lacefield, one of three tellers behind the counter. “How are you doing? What can I help you with?” The man gave his account information to Lacefield, and then handed her his money to deposit. 
The Class Act Federal Credit Union isn’t a typical bank. Jefferson County school employees founded it in 1954 to provide educators with financial services; it began setting up  branches in high schools in 2011 as a way to offer students work-based learning. Lacefield and the two other tellers are high schoolers. 
The credit union became one small piece of a districtwide effort, Academies of Louisville, to embed career and technical education, or CTE, alongside core subjects like math and English and require every student to pick a career pathway by 10th grade.
 Piloted in 2017 at 11 high schools, the model has expanded to all 15 of the district’s main high schools. As part of that effort, the district has also launched a career exploration program at 14 middle schools, partnered with local colleges and universities to provide dual credit courses and smoothed the path for students to graduate with industry-recognized certifications. 
Ford Next Generation Learning
The Academies of Louisville is one of roughly 30 such programs that are working to provide CTE for all students, regardless of whether they plan to go to college or directly into the workforce, according to Jessica Delgado, marketing and communications director of Ford Next Generation Learning, which helps school districts adopt the approach. The Ford Motor Company Fund made Louisville part of the network in 2014.
This “CTE for all” model has grown in popularity as support for the idea of “college for all” has eroded amid high tuition costs and low completion rates. The “CTE for all” model has support from employers interested in meeting local and regional workforce needs. And some experts argue that combining workforce and academic learning makes students more engaged and helps them build professional networks.

“A lack of access to work-based learning can actually limit the career prospects and economic mobility of youth and adults,” said Kyle Hartung, associate vice president for education at the nonprofit Jobs for the Future. He noted that there’s some evidence for the effectiveness of individual “CTE for all” programs and models, although data on the impact of the approach as a whole remains scant. 
Meanwhile, the career academies model requires a significant overhaul of the traditional high school model, and without buy-in from teachers, families and local and regional business leaders, it’s unlikely to work. In late November, Anchorage School District in Alaska postponed fully adopting the model after parents and school board members raised concerns about shorter class periods and the possibility that some core subjects would be replaced by career-themed courses. 
Dozing through chemistry, engaged in welding
For Marty Pollio, now Jefferson County Public Schools superintendent, the inspiration to adopt career-oriented education sprouted from a desire to engage more students in learning. He remembers as principal of Jeffersontown High School in early 2010 walking into a chemistry class to find one of the students asleep. 
After Pollio woke him up, the student explained that he didn’t care about the class and asked why he had to learn about the periodic table. Next period, the same student was attentive and engaged in the school’s welding lab, Pollio said, even as the class talked about some of the same content the chemistry class had covered. 
“We have a kid who has a passion for welding, why are we not teaching science from that perspective? Why are we not teaching math from that perspective?” Pollio recalled thinking. He encouraged his teachers to experiment and collaborate to find real-world applications for lessons. To help make science lessons more concrete, for example, the chemistry teacher began holding her class in the welding lab and both the chemistry and welding teachers began interweaving projects and lessons into each other’s classes.

Around that time, the district was seeking to expose more students to career pathways, especially after the state legislature in 2011 expanded how it evaluates schools to include students’ career readiness, a metric it has continued to refine since. In 2014, the city of Louisville was designated a Ford Next Generation Learning Community, and it joined the network of school districts that intend to provide CTE for all students. In 2016, Jefferson County leaders and principals, including Pollio, visited nearby Nashville, one of the first cities to launch the career academies model.
Adopting the model in Louisville required a shake-up of how the schools were organized: Every school created a freshman academy and two to three career academies, each with a designated principal and counselor (in addition to the schoolwide executive principal). 
Today, across the 15 high schools, there are 56 academies offering a total of 155 different industry pathways. As freshmen, students are introduced to each career pathway available at their high school before selecting one. Sophomore year, students start taking career courses in their chosen pathway, getting hands-on education.

Depending on the pathway, students earn either an industry certification or college credit through local postsecondary institutions such as Jefferson Community and Technical College. Students from the same academy also move through the majority of their core classes together, when possible. 
At Jeffersontown High, for example, students can join one of three academies: business and leadership, build and design, or the health sciences. Within those academies, students specialize in an industry pathway like engineering, teaching and learning, welding, allied health or marketing. Students in the business and leadership academy’s financial services pathway can work at their campus Class Act Credit Union. Other schools offer pathways in fields including healthcare, aviation, manufacturing, computer science, civil service and media arts. 
The program looks a little different at every school, said Kim Morales, an executive administrator of high schools for the district. Some combine instruction in core subjects like math with career instruction while others take a less integrated approach, she said.
Academy model requires teachers to be more creative, flexible
Fern Creek High School is among the schools that have tried the combination approach. On a Tuesday morning in late December, in the school’s engineering lab, students were building robotic cars they’d spent months designing. 
Down the hall, a computer science class was reminiscent of a real-world software development company — students worked in teams as lead developers, software developers, business analysts and technical writers for a class project. A few doors down, students in the fire science pathway were creating budgets for how to invest $2,000 to expand either the fire science program or the fire department. Students would present their plans to the Fern Creek Fire Department later in the semester. 
Upstairs, juniors in the early education pathway had just completed a lesson on the characteristics needed for effective early childhood educators and had started to work on the professional resumes they’d need to land internships or part-time jobs at child care centers and preschools that partner with the district. Elsewhere in the school, culinary students studied for a certification exam, while students in the JROTC pathway practiced with air rifles for an upcoming drill competition. 
Ryan Scott, who teaches biology and Advanced Placement Biology within the high school’s engineering, computer sciences and skilled trades academy, said the academy model requires core content teachers like him to be more flexible and creative. It can also help them focus their attention on certain content because their students tend to have shared interests, he said: “I can draw specific examples from computer science, from fire science, from plumbing, to teach my biology kids things, and it gives me kind of like an anchor point.” 
In an ecology unit on how ecosystems change over time, for example, Scott said he talked with his fire science students about the impact of forest fires on an ecosystem, and how sometimes firefighters use burning in specific areas to regenerate land.

Sara Abell, a former Advanced Placement teacher who now leads the academies at Fern Creek, said her thinking on whether students need college has morphed over time. “We need to make sure that we’re preparing all of our students, and college isn’t for everybody,” she said. “Kids don’t need to go to college and waste a bunch of money just to figure out that this isn’t for them and that they could have done something in a skilled trade.”
Students say the focus on career education has shaped them in different ways. Parker Bowdy, a senior in Fern Creek’s fire science pathway, had planned to join a fire department directly after graduation. But recently he said he’s considering college because it would open up more leadership opportunities within the fire service industry. 
Rayna Stewart, a junior at Fern Creek, is in the early childhood education pathway. She plans to pursue a college degree in chemistry, but said the education pathway has taught her a lot about how kids develop mentally and physically. It’s also given her a new perspective on the teaching profession. 
“It made me think more about what my teachers have to do in order to teach us,” Stewart said. “It’s made me think about how it would be as a teacher — like, ‘Oh would I enjoy being a math teacher?’ ”
The model has not expanded to the school’s magnet, specialized or alternative high schools. That’s largely because those schools already offer their own career-focused education, said Mark Hebert, a district spokesperson.
Parental pushback in Alaska
Across the country, in Alaska, the Anchorage School District launched the Academies of Anchorage this past fall — with much controversy. The district rolled out the model with a mandatory career exploration academy for ninth graders, after deciding in June to allow older students to opt out following parental pushback. 
Then, in November, the district emailed parents announcing that it would postpone further changes for at least a year after parents, teachers and school board members raised additional concerns about budget constraints and core classes being cut or replaced in order to make room for the academy changes. In January, the district released an updated plan saying that beginning with the 2025-26 school year, each of its main high schools would offer at least two career pathways, pending budget approval, which would be open to students in all grades but not mandatory. 
Jarrett Boling, a parent with two kids in the district who has been critical of the program’s implementation, said in December that district leaders never clearly explained the academy model and why it was being launched at a time when the school system was already facing teacher shortages and a budget deficit. Nor did the district answer questions about how the model would affect students’ ability to take honors or AP classes, he said. 
He said parents were surveyed about what academies they wanted but weren’t given much context about the model except that it would help increase the district’s graduation rate and build a better working relationship with the business community. “Part of my frustrations have been, I would say, mostly steered toward the school district itself and its kind of lack of transparency and information out to the public,” he said. 
MJ Thim, chief of communications for the Anchorage School District, wrote in an email that the district would not make officials available for an interview for this story, saying that “we are reworking a few things with the program.”
Big cost, big payoff, says superintendent
While Louisville’s model hasn’t generated much criticism, it hasn’t been an easy journey.
The model is expensive: $5.7 million in startup money, in addition to annual costs. “It’s a big cost yearly for us, however the payoff is very well worth it,” said Pollio.
“What’s happened historically is our kids … the ones that are the most successful are on a pathway. The ones who are struggling the most are not. They are just randomly picking classes to graduate and that’s not good for engagement,” Pollio said.
Pollio credits the model, for example, for helping to boost the district’s graduation and postsecondary readiness rates. Those have risen from 81 percent to 87 percent, and 50 to roughly 80 percent, respectively, between 2018 and 2024, according to district officials. At this time, the school system does not collect employment data on its graduates.

District leaders said the program remains little-known in Louisville, even among some parents, in part because it can be complicated to explain. This year the district has done more to publicize it, working with KentuckianaWorks, the regional workforce development board, to expand partnerships with local and regional businesses. Helping local employers understand that the district has 22,000 kids in career and technical education who are graduating with employable skills is “going to change this city long-term,” said Pollio. 
For Fatima Avila, the Jeffersontown branch coordinator at Class Act Credit Union, the model has been transformative. 
Eight years ago, when she was a junior at Southern High School, the district launched the academies model, and a branch of the district’s credit union opened at her school. She became one of its first student employees, and continued to work there part-time while earning her bachelor’s degree in social work at Northern Kentucky University. 
After graduation, she worked at a sober living home, but the role wasn’t as hands-on as she wanted and she missed the camaraderie and relationships she’d developed working in various Class Act branches. In June 2024, after Jeffersontown High School opened its own credit union branch, Avila was hired to lead it and work with students who are in the business and health sciences academy at the school.
“When I graduated high school, I did not think I would be back at Class Act like five years later,” Avila said. But she said she enjoys how the job allows her to mentor students and work with the wider community.
Lacefield, the Jeffersontown student, said she started picking up extra hours at the credit union after school to make money and because she enjoys it so much. A sophomore in the financial services pathway, she said she isn’t sure yet about her plans after high school but the credit union experience has been a positive one. 
“I ended up really, really loving getting to work with members, getting to work with people,” Lacefield said. “I just know that I really want to stay, whether I make money or not.”

The inset shows a closeup of a single strand. (Image by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases)HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) appear to be a slowly rising tide in the Ocean State, according to the most recent data from the state health department. 
STI surveillance data is reported on a lag, so the March report issued by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) contains long- and short-term data ending in 2023, plus some tentative findings for 2024. But recent increases in infections could also be trends returning to their baseline prior to the pandemic. 
“If you look at the data starting in 2020 we did see some significant declines starting with the pandemic, and that is because we were seeing less testing, less healthcare visits,” said Dr. Philip Chan, a primary care physician with Brown University Health and a medical consultant on the RIDOH report.
But people’s behavior also changed during that time, Chan added. “People were more likely to stay at home, more likely to isolate. What we were seeing on the ground was that a lot of people had a lot less sex partners, so there was just a lot less sex going on.”
The good news is that the state usually succeeds in treating HIV, with outcomes more positive than national averages and patients’ illness often stops before the virus progresses into AIDS. Less ideal are higher rates for other STIs like syphilis and gonorrhea, which climbed past pre-pandemic levels in 2023.
“From year to year, it’s tough to tell exactly what’s happening,” Chan said. “But I think that the trends the last couple years are clear that things are going up.”
Data for the more ubiquitous infections includes:

Syphilis has increased 58% from 2014 to 2023. There were 328 cases recorded in 2021, the highest number in decades. That fell to 240 cases in 2022, and 190 in 2023 — about the same as pre-pandemic levels, which had already risen since 2014. Preliminary data for 2024 shows similar trends. From 2020 to 2023, there were also about 10 cases of congenital syphilis — the state’s first instances in about a decade, and one example of testing’s importance in early detection, Chan said.

Gonorrhea cases rose 183.4% over the last 10 years. There were 590 cases in 2014, compared to 1,672 cases in 2023. There has not been a year with fewer than 1,000 cases since 2016. Men account for about twice as many cases as women.

Chlamydia cases have remained more consistent since 2014, and rose 21% over the decade, from 4,349 cases in 2014 to 5,269 cases in 2023. Women ages 20-24 exhibited the highest increase over that same period, but the report notes that women access routine screenings more than men, who are often asymptomatic when infected. 

“A key theme for all these STIs is that most people may not have symptoms,” Chan said. “And so the only way that you know that you may have it is to get tested, and that’s why testing is so so important.”
Chan pointed to primary care doctors and sex education as two ways people can become educated about the necessity of screening. Only 52% of adults ages 18 to 64 who had multiple sex partners received an STI test in the past year, according to 2022 data. Only 60% had ever received an HIV test.  










What we were seeing on the ground was that a lot of people had a lot less sex partners, so there was just a lot less sex going on.

Demographic and geographic factors also shaped the data. Racial disparities exist: In 2023, HIV rates were four times higher among Black residents and nearly sevenfold higher among Rhode Island’s Latino population, compared to caucasian residents. New HIV cases among Latinos have risen 132% since 2019, while dropping 63% among Black Rhode Islanders. Of newly diagnosed HIV cases in 2023, 31% were diagnosed in people born outside the United States, most frequently in the Caribbean and Central and South America.
Younger people ages 15-24 account for most new STI diagnoses, about half. The state’s urban core of Providence, East Providence, North Providence, Pawtucket, Woonsocket, Central Falls, and Cranston consistently reports the highest STI rates, with cases numbering in the dozens to hundreds, compared to fewer than five reported cases in many smaller towns.
“A lot of these STIs do disproportionately affect communities of color and other sorts of underserved populations,” Chan said. “It’s important, from a public health perspective, to think about how to continue and promote and increase access to care for those groups in order to address disparities like we see in STIs and frankly, many other things.”

Early diagnosis, prevention making a difference 
While an assortment of drugs can stop bacterial infections, there’s no cure for HIV. But HIV-positive people are living longer than ever due to modern antiretroviral drugs that suppress the virus and prevent it from progressing to a more serious diagnosis of AIDS. An adequately suppressed viral load can also make the disease intransmissible, and greatly improves quality of life by halting the virus from replicating. Advances in HIV drug therapy largely account for the deep reduction in the rate of HIV-related deaths, which nationally fell by almost half from from 2010 to 2017.
In Rhode Island in 2022, 93.2% of people living with HIV knew their status, 76% were receiving treatment and 71% had achieved viral suppression. And 93% of people who received their medical care within Rhode Island achieved viral suppression. 
Still, there was an above average number of HIV diagnoses, the preliminary 2024 data showed. From 2019-2023, RIDOH also observed that about 20% of people newly diagnosed with HIV had progressed to stage 3, or AIDS. On average, it takes eight years for HIV to develop into AIDS. 
Rhode Island has tried to prevent those outcomes by early diagnosis, and by fortifying its residents against HIV through preventative measures — namely, PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis. Patients who adhere to the schedule for taking this group of antiretroviral drugs can have up to a 99% lower chance of contracting HIV from unprotected sex. PrEP provides an approximate 74% reduction in the likelihood of contracting HIV via injectable drug use.
Successful state laws from 2023 and 2024 made PrEP as widely available as possible by slashing away potential restrictions from insurers and eliminating out-of-pocket costs. Chan, only had “good things to say” about those laws — including the resulting interactions with insurers, who have largely been quick to correct mistakes in patient billing. The main challenge now, Chan said, is when interruptions occur, and a person loses their job, insurance, and access to PrEP.

 Several sexual health clinics and community health centers in Rhode Island offer low or no cost services and assist in minimizing any out-of-pocket costs associated with PrEP prescriptions and testing. For a list go to Rhode Island’s PrEP Champions Network. 

“I actually had a patient of mine for several years who had insurance and was on PrEP,” Chan said. “They lost their insurance for a couple months and had to go off PrEP, and they actually, unfortunately, acquired HIV during that time. This was just a month ago.”
RIDOH continues to promote the Rhode Island PrEP Champions Network, which has participating clinics across the state that expedite access to PrEP as well as its sibling PEP, or post-exposure prophylaxis, which is taken for about a month, starting within 72 hours of possible HIV exposure. Properly taken, the drug prevents HIV infection.
The comparable treatment for preventing bacterial STIs is DoxyPEP, which usually consists of a single, two-pill, dose of doxycycline taken after sex. Doxycycline is an old drug, and thus an inexpensive means of lowering contraction rates, Chan suggested. 
“DoxyPEP is the newest kid on the block,” he said, noting that the nationwide rollout is still in its early stages. But so far the data looks good, with evidence from places like San Francisco suggesting it can make a difference.
“We’re very optimistic about it, and I think the coming years will be able to tell whether or not it’s making a significant impact on overall population trends,” Chan said.

(Getty Images)Kentucky teachers took an undeserved financial hit from the Kentucky legislature during the 2025 session.
For background, the “Shared Responsibility” law (House Bill 540) was passed in 2010. The Kentucky Teachers Retirement System (TRS) board and education community members, including active and retired teachers, school board members, superintendents and experts, collaborated to find a solution.  
The bill established the TRS retiree health fund (health insurance trust), which exists independently from the Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement Fund. At the time, although suggested and requested due to a history of underfunding by the state, the legislature refused to include increased matching contributions by the state into the Kentucky Teachers’ Retirement Fund to begin addressing its much-publicized unfunded liability. 
The funding structure of HB 540 required active teachers to pay 3.75% of their salary, retired teachers under the age of 65 to pay the equivalent of the monthly cost of Medicare Part B, and school districts to contribute 3% of their gross payroll to the health insurance trust.  
Notably, HB 540 included a provision stating that once the health insurance fund achieved sufficient prefunding, as determined actuarially, the 3.75% contribution from active teachers shall be “decreased, suspended, or eliminated.” The same was true for the amount school systems paid in.
While receiving widespread praise for its collaborative development, the Shared Responsibility bill passed through the Kentucky House and Senate without any opposing votes. Gov. Steve Beshear signed it into law on April 13, 2010. 
Overall, the bill was a significant step towards securing financial support for retired teachers’ health care. It reflected a commitment to the education community while relieving Kentucky taxpayers of a $5 billion liability.  
Sounds good?  Right?  Not so fast. The 2025 Kentucky legislature put the brakes on the “shall, in an actuarially accountable manner, be either decreased, suspended, or eliminated” part related to active teachers’ and school systems’ contributions to the health insurance trust.
Now that the retiree health insurance trust is nearly 100% funded, lawmakers voted to renege on the deal that was made in 2010 by passing House Bill 694 (AN ACT relating to Teachers’ Retirement System benefit funding). 
To paraphrase the new law, when the Teachers’ Retirement Fund and the health insurance trust are fully funded, the 3.75% presently going to the health insurance trust may be decreased, suspended, or eliminated. In addition, the school funding for the retiree health insurance trust will be diverted to the Teachers’ Retirement Fund.
According to the actuarial analysis of HB 694, the Teachers’ Retirement Fund will not be 100% funded until 2047. This means teachers will have to wait many more years than initially legislated to have a reduction in the 3.75% deducted from their paycheck. Heavy sigh.
Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed HB 694. In his veto message, he stated,  “House Bill 694 breaks a promise made to teachers in 2010 and does so without even giving them an opportunity for input.”  That’s right; the education community was left out of the bill-making process this time around.  
Beshear went on to mention that teachers would “need to pay much longer than the law calls for” and that “breaking this promise is unfair to the teachers we rely on to guide our children and the future of the Commonwealth.” 
Disappointingly, 67 members of the House and 29 members of the Senate voted to override Beshear’s veto, basically on partisan lines, with the overwhelming majority of the “yea” votes coming from Republicans. 
No doubt, this legislation takes money right out of the pockets of hard-working teachers. 
Like many others across Kentucky, teachers have children to raise, student loan obligations to meet, car and mortgage payments to make, utility bills to pay and groceries to buy, all on a limited budget. In addition, teachers purchase school supplies, necessities and extras for their classrooms.  
The 3.75% deducted from Kentucky teachers’ paychecks equals approximately $1,400 to $2,800 annually. This amount adds up over time while straining  teachers’ monthly budgets. This move does nothing to retain and recruit Kentucky teachers at a time when teachers are becoming harder to find. 
It is the job of those in power in the legislature to fulfill their obligations to teachers.     Transparent and authentic commitments supporting teachers that ensure fair compensation and benefits are vital in creating sustainable educational environments. Before passing legislation that hurts educators’ financial bottom line, lawmakers would be wise to keep in mind that our Kentucky public school teachers have the future of the commonwealth in their classrooms.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/teachers-desk-1024x1024.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

Matters of little consequence often get major time and attention. And vice versa. Two energy bills in the Colorado Legislature this year, one about nuclear energy and the second about electrical transmission, illustrate this.
The first bill, House Bill 25-1040, which is now law, declared that nuclear energy is clean. It proclaims that utilities can meet clean-energy targets with nuclear. It also allows private projects access to financing restricted to clean energy development.
The bill sailed through the Legislature. Gov. Jared Polis signed it into law March 31. For believers, those who want to believe that nuclear energy will be the answer, it was a big win.
To what effect? Likely none. Forget about nuclear waste and safety concerns. Cost of energy from new nuclear plans remains exorbitant.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Some of this was sorted through in a four-hour committee hearing in March. Chuck Kutscher was among several dozen individuals given two-minute slots to testify. He deserved more time. A nuclear engineer by training, he subsequently moved into renewables, retiring from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory several years ago.
At a later meeting in Jefferson County, Kutscher explained why he expects nuclear energy to play no role in Colorado’s energy transition. It comes down to cost.
“I like to give credit where credit is due. And the fact is that nuclear power in this country has saved a heck of a lot of carbon dioxide and air pollution emissions,” he said. “Nuclear provides almost half of U.S. carbon-free electricity, which is pretty impressive.”
As for costs, Kutscher cited two metrics courtesy of Lazard, a financial company that monitors electrical generation. The cost of building new nuclear plants comes in at $8,000 to $13,000 per kilowatt of generating capacity. Solar comes in at $1,400, wind at $2,000.
A broader metric, the levelized cost, includes capital, fuel and operating costs over the life of an energy plant. “The longer a plant runs, the lower its life-cycle costs, because it’s producing more energy,” Kutscher explained. By this measure, nuclear still comes up short: 18 cents a kilowatt-hour compared to solar and wind for 5 and 6 cents.
Might costs drop with a new generation of small modular reactors? SMRs can generate 300 megawatts or less. One was planned in the West, but in 2023 the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems pulled out of its contract with nuclear company NuScale — because of cost.
If nuclear costs make it a non-starter in Colorado, can renewables deliver us to an emission-free electrical system? The sun vanishes daily, and sometimes winds on our eastern plains die down, even for days. Kutscher sees possible solutions in improving storage technologies and expanded transmission. Transmission can enable electricity to be shared across multiple time zones and weather systems.
Transmission technologies
Even moving electricity around Colorado more efficiently has value. The second bill, Senate Bill 24-127, proposes to do that. It would require investor-owned utilities to investigate tools called advanced transmission technologies. They will enable more use from existing transmission lines and associated infrastructure.
Larry Milosevich, a Lafayette resident, decided six years ago to devote himself to fewer pursuits. He says he chose the role of advanced technologies for transmission because of its oversized impact.  The transmission system developed during the last century has many inefficiencies.
“I would love to see advanced transmission technologies get a little more light,” he says. Why hasn’t it happened? “It doesn’t have sex appeal.”
This bill will not solve all problems. “You need a lot of arrows in your quiver to get there. And it’s not one technology that’s going to save the day,” says Leah Rubin Shen, managing director of Advanced Energy United, an industry association that advocates for technologies and policies that advance decarbonization.
More transmission will still be needed. Approvals take time. Using these tools can more rapidly expand capacity at lower cost. “We characterize it as a no-regrets solution,” says Rubin Shen.
State Sen. Cleave Simpson, a Republican from Alamosa, was the primary author of the bill. “We can increase the capacity and resilience of our infrastructure without having to undertake expensive, large-scale construction projects,” he told committee members at a March meeting.
The committee that day heard from fewer than a dozen witnesses. It passed an amended bill and moved on within 45 minutes. Several weeks before, the same committee heard nuclear testimony for hours.
In a later interview, Simpson described the bill, slimmed greatly in ambition from its original iteration, as “maybe a tiny step forward, but a doable one.”
Unlike nuclear, not the answer, but a doable one.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The plot is thickening in the Rhode Island Department of Education’s (RIDE) takeover of Providence public schools. It’s been five years. Providence wants them back ASAP. But neither side has offered ways to rebuild the foundations that cement the dysfunction.  
Until now.
Useful ideas are emerging at the State House, with increasingly specific proposals that have actual meat on nice-sounding principles. In a true act of forward movement, Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced three bills on March 7 that could really improve how Providence schools govern themselves, deploy their own resources, and maintain high quality staff. 
Zurier’s bills were introduced a month after Gov. Dan McKee and RIDE outlined nine conditions the city must meet to regain local control by June 2026.
Basically, the city must provide more money, fiscal transparency, a trained and well-informed board, and improved facilities. No argument there, but where are changes to education policy per se? One condition told the city to “establish performance-based outcomes for contracts at the Providence Public School Department, such as custodial services.” Wait. Custodial contracts?!  
The nine conditions seemed tone deaf to report after report. Like the Providence Blueprint for Education, which called the school district “confused about priorities.”
Like the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy 2019 review that precipitated the takeover by documenting a laundry list of problems, from the majority of students performing below grade level to demoralized teachers and unsafe school buildings. 
Like last year’s Senate Education Commission’s report, identifying the Providence teachers contract as a huge obstacle to student success.   










Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced three bills on March 7 that could really improve how Providence schools govern themselves, deploy their own resources, and maintain high quality staff. 


RIDE Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green soon followed up with a substantial, detailed letter to the city clarifying and reducing nine conditions to five overarching concerns: Governance, Finances, Facilities, Legislation and a Transition Plan. 
Four of the concerns have numbered and bulleted details with educational asks, like requiring the school board to shift its focus from adult inputs to student outcomes — the very heart of the matter.
But “Legislation” has only a vague sentence requesting an intergovernmental team to work on state laws “to remove legislative barriers to improving outcomes and opportunities for Providence’s children.”  
While clearly anti-kid and anti-education, legislative barriers seem immutable because no one wants conflicts with our powerful teachers unions. Remember this: A public-sector teachers union is a private-sector business whose mission is to benefit and protect teachers. The laws serve adults.  
Thankfully, the trio of bills from Zurier offer a better way. Here’s how:
Senate Bill No. 745 – Expedited grievance process  
State law imposes a grievance procedure so onerous, administrators rarely try to discipline or fire a non-performing teacher. Unions argue they “counsel out” poor teachers with a stern conversation, and sometimes that does work. But teachers’ union dues entitle members to full-throated legal protection if they want it. 
Abundant stories, now too old to threaten confidentiality, include the 80-year-old who slept through classes, but whom the union protected on the grounds that the district had not supplied adequate professional development.  
The commission offers an example of the onerous process with the story of a 2014 grievance that originated with an evidence-filled termination letter to a certain teacher. After several district hearings, the grievance went to RIDE for “an appeal to a hearing officer, a review by the commissioner, a second review by the commissioner, an appeal to the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education and an appeal to the Superior Court which upheld the termination.” The Supreme Court is still an option. 
Solution: End blanket protection of all teachers no matter their performance by shortening the wealth of opportunities to appeal administrative decisions. At the same time, this bill would create guardrails to protect teachers who serve students well. The guardrails legislate against arbitrary or vengeful terminations by including a list of specific grounds for reprimand or dismissal. If the shorter appeals process doesn’t work, the matter goes to binding arbitration by specified outside parties whose decision is final. These revisions are fair to teachers and create flexibility for administration.
Senate Bill No. 746. Mandatory annual salary step increases
By law, districts and their municipalities must stick to a “a salary schedule recognizing years of service” with up to 12 annual pay increase steps. This “lock-step” pay system is a throwback to the 1960s automotive factory workers’ contracts on which our teachers’ contracts were modeled. Districts can not negotiate innovative pay systems that incentivize our best teachers to stay in the profession by, for example, advancing up the salary scale more quickly by taking on leadership roles. Conversely, teachers who need to improve get the same salary bump as everyone else.  
Solution: Eliminate the “lock-step” mandate so schools have the freedom to deploy their resources where they’re needed. The adjusted bill allows Providence to “negotiate alternative salary schedules” outside of the rigid factory-model uniformity, which may include other “bases for increased compensation” including paying “teachers willing to take on greater responsibilities.”
Senate Bill No. 747. Laying off teachers by seniority
State law mandates hiring, laying off and re-hiring teachers by seniority, which is to say, who has the oldest date of original hire. If student enrollment declines, unionized teachers must be retained or re-hired by seniority. Administrators don’t get to decide to keep the most effective educators on staff. It’s LIFO, or Last In, First Out. 
Another old story: Years ago, the district dismissed a famously popular Teacher of the Year because his three-year probation wasn’t up yet. Senior teachers who had not been rehired by a failing school that was being rebooted (“reconstituted”) had legal rights to his job. The public hew and cry made no difference. Seniority is the law. Even if contract negotiators agree to suspend strict seniority, they invite lawsuits.  
Solution: Limit LIFO, with caveats. The new bill is longer than the original 1960s-era legislation because it details what teachers might be retained regardless of seniority. They include bilingual teachers, teachers with excellent evaluations or needed skills, teachers of the year and others. For the record, teachers of color are more likely to be new, so LIFO upsets efforts to diversify the workforce. 
It’s worth noting that these bills were assigned to the Senate Labor Committee instead of the Education Committee, again prioritizing adult concerns over kids.
There’s still time, though. The legislature can still make the needed changes. If not, the dysfunctional Providence district will be a hot potato passed back and forth between the state and the city, neither of which really has the tools to succeed. 
If that happens, the Providence students will be right back where they were in 1993 when these problems were first reported. 
Remember the local cliché: “As goes Providence, so goes the state.”

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Before everything went black, Tamika Jackson felt like she was drowning. While in labor giving birth to her baby boy, her body felt heavy and her breaths shallow.
“I can’t breathe,” she croaked to the anesthesiologist.
“If you couldn’t breathe, you wouldn’t be able to speak,” she recalled the doctor telling her, dismissing her as having a “panic attack.”
Minutes later, the 37-year-old’s lungs gave out. Her heart stopped beating.
Clinicians were able to resuscitate Jackson. Her baby boy was born via C-section, and the Michigan mom lived to tell her story of giving birth to Cree, who’s turning 3 next month.
Jackson is now a maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based nonprofit. She spoke with Stateline while on a bus to the Michigan Capitol, where she participated in a Black Maternal Health Week panel and pushed for a legislative package — nicknamed the Michigan Momnibus — which aims to increase obstetric patient protections and improve care for moms of color.
The Michigan Senate passed the package Thursday, and it now heads to the House.
Black moms like Jackson are three times more likely to die than white mothers and suffer higher rates of pregnancy-related complications.
But in its bid to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives, the Trump administration has terminated community health grants and closed federal offices that support state efforts to tackle racial health disparities. Experts say the moves will hinder efforts to improve Black maternal health.
“DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival,” Jackson said. “This is about community-based solutions — and they’re undoing that.”
Jackson added that without federal dollars, “We’re going to be left trying to do a whole lot with a whole lot of nothing.”
The Trump administration has cut grants for maternal health studies and research on health disparities in various populations, including patients of color and LGBTQ people. It has laid off most staff at the federal Division of Reproductive Health, and removed maternal health data from federal agency websites.
It also is considering cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from about $121 billion to about $80.4 billion, according to The New York Times. The administration plans to create a new Administration for a Healthy America, which would focus on maternal and child health, among other issues.
HHS and its National Institutes of Health did not return requests for comment in time for publication.










DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival.


– Tamika Jackson, Michigan mom and maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice


Researchers and advocates like Jackson say that amid the Trump administration’s erasures, their work will continue.
Among those losing grants are nonprofits, health care systems and universities, including the Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically Black medical school in Atlanta, which received a $2.96 million grant for a center to improve the health of Black pregnant and postpartum women. Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation.
“We are reviewing the situation to assess how it may affect our research,” a Morehouse spokesperson wrote in an email. “More broadly, it is important that we all recognize the critical role medical research plays in developing potential life-saving innovation that will mitigate disease and improve the health and well-being of many people.”

The Morehouse center was selected among an initial 10 research centers funded under the NIH’s Maternal Health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone, or “IMPROVE,” Initiative.
Columbia University and community groups throughout New York also received the grants. One goal was to connect postpartum moms with doulas to detect conditions such as postpartum preeclampsia, according to principal investigator Dr. Uma Reddy, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia. Reddy said the grant was developed with communities who voiced their needs.
“We can actually prevent these deaths and these serious complications,” Reddy said. “This is a way to focus on a high-risk population and provide them with the resources that they don’t have available.”

Tufts University maternal health scholar Ndidiamaka Amutah-Onukagha said she’s had several meetings in Washington, D.C., get canceled, and while she’s thankful to have almost completed one federal grant project, there’s uncertainty about other grants she’s applied for, including a Black postpartum support research initiative.
The professor runs the Maternal Outcomes for Translational Health Equity Research (MOTHER) Lab and Center for Black Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice at the Tufts University School of Medicine.
“It not only stalls progress, but it actually actively endangers the most vulnerable among us,” she said. “These policy decisions can cause and will cause lasting harm to people who are already underserved by our health care system.”
Amutah-Onukagha said she is urging researchers and advocates to have “cautious optimism.”
“Most people are in the space of gloom and doom. I do get that, and I’m vastly in and out of that,” she said. “But because of the work that I do in maternal health, we have to remain optimistic. That lens cannot die. If it does, then the communities that we serve are going to be even more disadvantaged.”
Amutah-Onukagha, who recently testified before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Health, said her team will continue to work with organizations around the state, such as Birth Equity & Justice Massachusetts and Resilient Sisterhood Project.
“We’re stronger in numbers,” she said.
Diana Greene Foster, research director in reproductive health at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted the seminal Turnaway Study documenting the harms women suffer from abortion denials.
She was in the middle of another study, funded by a federal grant, tracking post-Roe abortions and the efficacy of health exceptions in abortion ban laws. Her team was interviewing emergency room doctors about whether they could provide abortions amid major pregnancy complications such as eclampsia, a serious consequence of preeclampsia, which is a dangerous form of high blood pressure that disproportionately affects Black mothers.
The administration pulled her grant.
Foster, who is fundraising to continue her study, said she feels the administration’s actions send a message of “turning their back on science, on compassion, on caring about women.”

Tina Sherman, a doula and national director of maternal justice at MomsRising, a nonpartisan women and mothers advocacy group, said she worries about data the administration has removed, including the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
The surveillance system is a comprehensive tool states use to track maternal health and formulate policies to improve it.
“An attempt to erase the data,” said Sherman, “doesn’t erase the harm that has been done and creates additional harm.”
Without data, states can’t target where resources are needed and which communities are disproportionately harmed and how, said Sherman, who co-chairs the North Carolina Maternal Mortality Review Committee.
“We’re going to be going backwards,” she said.
The Trump administration also canceled several grants focused on intimate partner violence, a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death which disproportionately affects people of color.
One such grant was supporting a University of North Carolina project studying intimate partner violence against pregnant women shortly before they give birth.
“The issues remain. The urgency is pressing as it ever was. The reality is this: Black mothers and birthing people continue to carry the weight of a crisis that we did not create,” Amutah-Onukagha said. “We did not create it, but we are leading the fight to solve it and dismantle it, and we know that the systemic barriers existed before this administration.
They will continue to show up — but we will also continue to produce cutting-edge research here at the center.”

(Vlad Gavrilovic / Norfolk Transit Department)Virginia’s Department of Rail and Public Transportation has just released their draft six- year improvement program for fiscal year 2026, totaling roughly $7 billion. The funds cover both operational costs and larger sums for capital improvement projects statewide. 
The City of Alexandria, for example, will get money to help cover the $200,000  operational cost for their GO Alex program, which is the city’s outreach program to get residents to ride transit, carpool and commute by bicycle. Hampton Roads’ transportation department will receive funds towards replacing two large buses, a project that will total $1.6 million – and that’s just one of their more than 30 plus capital improvement projects. Localities depend on the state money to update the equipment used to serve the public in various regions of Virginia.
“We of course got money to buy new buses. We have a fleet of over 300 buses,” said Ray Amoruso, chief planning and development officer for Hampton Roads Transportation. “The average life of a bus is either 10 or 12 years and at some point they have to be replaced. So every year we ask for bus money.”
 How the six-year funding program works

The Six-year Improvement Program (SYIP) is an annual funding program that both DRPT and the Virginia Department of Transportation administer to help fund rail — including freight – and public transit programs across the state. The different amounts of funding found in the six-year projects is derived by formulas established by Virginia law. Individual projects, which localities apply for, are funded by the SYIP and are evaluated and given scores by DRPT, then approved by the Commonwealth Transportation Board. 
“The state updates their six-year improvement plan every year. So it’s like a moving window. Each year we progress,” said Amoruso. “Sometimes we ask for the same money if they didn’t award it to us [the first time]. Next year, we’ll do this all over again.”
Here’s a breakdown of how the funds will be allocated in the upcoming fiscal year:. 

Public Transportation: $332 million
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA): $442 million
Virginia Railway Express (VRE): $17 million
Rail (DRPT) $20 million
Transforming Rail in Virginia (VPRA) $232 million

Amoruso said the district gets federal operating assistance based on the size of their metropolitan area and the number of people who live in that area. The Hampton Roads Transportation District covers six cities: Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach.
“A lot of folks who aren’t familiar with HRT or don’t use HRT think that the money they drop in the fare box pays for their ride,” he said. 
One capital project that Amoruso is excited about getting funding to build is an off-street transfer facility off Chesapeake Boulevard known as the Evelyn T. Butts Transfer Station, named after a local Civil Rights activist. Since 1999, riders have had to wait on the street to transfer buses.
“It’s not a pleasant environment. Nine routes come together and people run up and down the block along the length of the block to make connections to other routes,” said Amoruso. “It’s the third busiest transfer center we have in terms of moving human beings back in and out every day.”
 Federal funding could be in jeopardy 

Though next year’s state transportation fiscal funding is taking shape, the uncertainty of future federal support weighs heavy on Amoruso, he said. 
President Donald Trump’s administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have committed to cutting over a trillion dollars in government spending they deem wasteful, targeting scores of federal programs with special emphasis on eliminating ones supporting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (DEI). A January executive order by Trump sparked panic with its directives to federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation, to pause millions in federal funds disbursements, including money allotted for capital improvement projects through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and for electric vehicle and clean energy infrastructure development. 
“It’s not just us, every transit property in the country is nervous because the administration is targeting certain discretionary programs that are connected to DEI initiatives, climate change initiatives,” Amoruso said.  “We in the past have been successful in getting grant awards for low-emission, no-emission buses, meaning electric buses.”
Amoruso said HRT had a goal to convert their 300 diesel buses to a 100% hundred emissions-free, all electric bus system by 2045.
“This administration doesn’t look like they have an appetite to support those kinds of investments,” he said. “That’s just one example, but there are other programs that are at risk related to DEI and all the transit properties in the country are nervous about that and [are] watching very carefully these discretionary grants.”
One grant program Amoruso is watching is a capital investment initiative administered through Congress to help build out bus rapid transit, such as Richmond’s Pulse line or other light rail systems. 
“That’s under the microscope of the federal government right now,” said Amoruso, “which is making a lot of people nervous for high capacity transit projects.”
Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has stated to cut federal funding to Democratic-led states and cities, like New York and California, if they don’t release information on transit crime and safety funding, according E&E News by Politico. 
 Public input needed

The public is invited to comment on all the projects that have been recommended for funding in the draft six-year plan. The Commonwealth Transportation Board will host nine meetings across the state from the week of April 22 through May 15. Online comments, email or regular mail are also being accepted. 
The first meetings take place this week, starting in Richmond, followed by a meeting Wednesday in Lynchburg and one on Thursday in Hampton Roads. 
On June 17 staff from DRPT will present the draft, including any changes, to the Commonwealth Transportation Board for approval. On July 1, all the approved funding will become available.

(Ben Cunningham/ Allegheny-Blue Ridge Alliance.)The future of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Corridor is coming into clearer focus after the Virginia Department of Transportation recently released its highly anticipated rail with trail assessment and completed a series of related public hearings. 
In 2021, the agency completed its first study of Norfolk Southern’s 50-mile corridor, which local leaders and community organizers, who are part of the Friends of the Shenandoah Rail Trail, hope will lead to converting the rail corridor into a trail. 
VDOT’s second corridor review comes after the Shenandoah Rail Corridor Coalition, a smaller group of community members, questioned the possibility of restoring the Manassas Gap railroad and constructing a trail alongside it. 
The rail corridor, first established in the 1850s, runs from Front Royal to the town of Broadway in Rockingham County. As interest declined in freight service, the company began discontinuing sections of the corridor in 1989, moving operations to Norfolk Southern’s Crescent Corridor, which runs east.
Kate Wofford, executive director of the Alliance for Shenandoah Valley, said her group is “eager” to convert the corridor to a trail, a goal shared by their colleagues, the Friends of the Shenandoah Rail Trail.
“We wanted to get going with it years ago,” said Wofford. “So the sooner we can get started with this wonderful project, the sooner it will start bringing benefits to quality of life, local economic development, tourism (and) to the towns.”
Keven Walker, executive director for the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, part of the Shenandoah Rail Corridor Coalition, was asked for comment, but did not immediately respond.
The foundation is facing a lawsuit from one of its members over plans to restore the inactive Manassas Gap rail line in the Shenandoah Valley. The suit claims the foundation’s involvement strays far from its mission and threatens its federal tax-exempt status.
 The assessment

Phase 1 of the study to assess the proposal for restoring the railroad and constructing an adjacent trail details projected costs, risks, and public feedback.
While the assessment did not provide a precise total cost to taxpayers, state lawmakers stipulated that “up to $35.0 million shall be allocated to the Shenandoah Valley Rail Trail for the purposes of land acquisition, initial planning, and site” development through the 2020-2022 state budget negotiation.
Some of the costs that would need to be considered are $66 million to repair the existing bridges, $4 million to $18 million to bring the rail line up to the FRA Class II standards, and funding to purchase easements and right of way and land acquisitions, given the narrow 33-foot setback from the centerline of the rail.
The study identified several unknown design factors and associated risks compared to the rail-to-trail concept, including the cantilevered trail structures on existing bridges, which would require retrofitting and may present maintenance and trail user safety concerns. 
The agency also received feedback from county administrators and town managers from 12 localities along the corridor; all of them said their communities supported the rail-to-trail proposal.
The consensus among the leaders is that business use of the rail isn’t in high demand. The study stated, “no localities indicated a strong interest from the business community for freight rail service.” 
However, the agency noted that two existing businesses, which were not identified in the study, have shown interest in using rail. Other industries, such as food processing, have indicated that rail does not fit their business model. 
Several economic development offices have received inquiries from businesses that perceive the ability to increase their customer base from trail users, the study found.
 What’s next

VDOT is currently in Phase 2 of the project to assess the corridor. The process will continue throughout the year with experts reviewing how water moves through the targeted area to inform flood prevention plans, assessing the train tracks and bridges and conducting in-person public meetings and an online public survey.
Phase 3 will conclude with a review of ownership and maintenance and a presentation of the cost estimate and assessment report, with public meetings to follow between the winter and spring of 2026.

(Courtesy Virginians For Reproductive Freedom)“Politicians shouldn’t control your body,” reads a billboard that will soon be unveiled in Central Virginia and Hampton Roads as part of a new campaign highlighting an in-progress legislative effort to enshrine reproductive health care options like abortion, contraception and in vitro fertilization into Virginia’s constitution. 
These issues, longtime priorities for Democratic state lawmakers, will likely feature prominently in this year’s House of Delegates elections, where all 100 seats will be on the ballot. 
“It’s going to be in our hands, then it’s going to be in your hands,” Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said at a press conference earlier this year when touting the amendment. Boysko sponsored the amendment that would cement access to abortion care in Virginia’s code in the state Senate this year, which the legislature advanced. 
As Republican incumbents have opposed the measure, a coalition of organizations have rallied for an ad blitz spotlighting the matter. 
To support candidates who share the amendment’s goal, a cohort has emerged called Virginians For Reproductive Freedom,. The consortium includes Repro Rising Virginia, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, League of Women Voters of Virginia, and Birth In Color and other organizations. It also includes Virginia’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
VRF recently announced plans for the billboards to be placed near college campuses in Hampton, Norfolk and Williamsburg and 100 sidewalk decals with similar messaging will be installed in high foot-traffic areas around Norfolk and Richmond. 
Multilingual multimedia content is planned that will break down how the constitutional amendment process works. Having passed the legislature this year, it will need to pass again next year before appearing as a referendum on ballots statewide. 
But that may only be possible if Democrats retain or grow their majority in the House of Delegates this year, as the amendment advanced this year on partisan lines. 
Virginia’s current law allows most abortions up to 26 weeks of pregnancy with limitations and approval required for the procedure to take place later. Many state Republicans have consistently opposed the current law, with some seeking to reduce the limit to 15 weeks, and others having supported near-total bans. This year, Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, introduced a bill that would have specifically protected abortion as a treatment for nonviable pregnancies, but it was never docketed or put up for a vote.
Republican abortion bill banned from Virginia’s 2025 legislative session

“Miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are nonviable pregnancies, and therefore cannot be confused with elective abortion procedures,” she told The Mercury at the time. “This would have put any doubt about the law to rest.” 
Abortions at or after 21 weeks are rare, making up just 1% of cases nationwide.  When they do occur, it’s often due to severe fetal anomalies that aren’t detected earlier through testing or because of life-threatening complications later in pregnancy. 
If Virginia’s constitution were amended, the three-physician approval threshold for later-stage abortions would be reduced to one. 
Earlier this year, House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah called the resolution a “word salad” designed to “cloud the true intentions” of the amendment. He argued that reducing the current requirement for three doctors to sign off on a procedure to just one would lower safeguards.
“The abortion doctor can do that,” Gilbert said. 
But supporters of the amendment have stressed that it could be particularly critical in rural pregnancy health crises, where patients already have to travel further for care. 
If enshrined in Virginia’s constitution, abortion access and other reproductive rights would become far more resistant to legislative shifts, shielding from the kind of partisan turnover that has shaped abortion laws in other states. But constitutional amendments are hard to undo — and equally hard to pass.
With the resolutions now clearing the legislature for the first time, the real test comes next year, when lawmakers will have to approve them again before voters get the final say at the ballot box.

There are many shortcomings in the new proposed state budget approved by the North Carolina Senate last week – the inadequate pay raises for teachers and state employees, the failure to invest in numerous core public services that have been reeling from staffing shortages, the giveaways to unaccountable special interests.
But if there’s an overarching flaw that lies at the heart of the proposal, it is the plan to plow ahead with new and regressive tax cuts at a time when state economists are warning of significant budget shortfalls in the near future.
Republican Senate leader Phil Berger – a smalltown lawyer with no credentials in economics – says the consensus forecast of the state’s economists is wrong. He claims the state’s fiscal picture will remain rosy even with new corporate and personal income tax cuts taking effect and massive new reductions in federal aid from the Trump administration.
It’s a remarkably oblivious stance.
The bottom line: North Carolina public services are already running on a shoestring and the Senate’s decision to pull that string even tighter is a huge mistake.

Maggie Hassan (left) speaks with substance use disorder treatment specialists at Elliot Health System during an event in Manchester on April 14 about how Medicaid cuts would affect their work. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Abby L’Heureux, a physician and addiction specialist at the Center for Recovery Management in Manchester, is already worried about some of her patients who have lost Medicaid coverage. Now, as Republicans in Washington, D.C., make massive cuts to the federal budget — which experts say will most likely impact Medicaid — she and her colleagues could see even more of their patients lose coverage for the care they need.
At an event organized by U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan and Elliot Health System in Manchester earlier this month, L’Heureux told the story of a 30-year-old man who started using cocaine, alcohol, and opioids as a teenager and was incarcerated for the first time at 13. She said he has an extensive family history of substance use disorder as his mother died during an overdose and all his parents and grandparents have been incarcerated. On top of that, he has a seizure disorder and was homeless when he first began treatment with the center. While he hasn’t yet achieved stable long term sobriety, she said they were beginning to see success when they got him on a medication regime that includes an injectable.
“He’s just been doing so well and we continue to have little slips here and there, and we’re working on things, but he keeps coming,” she said. “And that’s a win for us, that he keeps showing up, and he keeps trying. And we always have hope that it’s just one step closer to his goal. His goal is abstinence and so, and we’re just gonna keep walking with him, one step closer, one step closer, and we’re gonna have setbacks, and that’s just a part of the process. But, he’s been doing so well, so much better, now that we’ve got him on a medication that works for him.”
L’Heureux said he’s feeling so well that he’s begun working full time again because he “just functions much better when he’s working full time, and really has things to do during the day.” However, this came with a drawback. He just lost the Medicaid coverage he uses to pay for the treatment because he’s now making too much money. She said his injectable alone costs $2,000 monthly without insurance and he has 10 different medications. She said they worry about how the Medicaid change will impact his progress, though he’s worked with a peer support coordinator to find marketplace insurance.
“That’s one of the things that we have to continue to focus on,” Hassan added. “Somebody is getting well enough to work, which is the goal — one of the goals — and then, but we don’t want them to lose insurance in the process. We want them to be able to keep coming here.”
Conversely, L’Heureux spoke of a 37-year-old man who started using cocaine at age 13, opioids at 15, and crystal meth at 22. He began working with her at the Center for Recovery Management and is taking 16 milligrams of a combination product of multiple opioid use medications. Now, he’s been sober since August 2023 and has become an advocate for his peers who speaks at commitment meetings and runs his own sober living facility. She said he even saved somebody from an overdose recently using the emergency medication Narcan. He is still able to use Medicaid for his treatments, which she said has been huge in his recovery.
The April 14 meeting came amid growing fears that Medicaid, the country’s public health care program for those with low income or high needs, could be heavily scaled down in the federal budgeting process. On April 10, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to approve legislation outlining the federal budget. That outline, which was passed 216-214 entirely through Republican support, calls for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to clear the way for President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — which has long been lambasted by the left and economists as disproportionately benefitting the wealthy — to be renewed.
The outline instructs several committees to make varying levels of cuts to different areas of the budget. That includes the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has been tasked with cutting its portion of the budget by $880 billion over 10 years. It doesn’t explicitly specify that these cuts must come from Medicaid, but because the program comprises about $8.2 trillion of the $8.6 trillion the committee can cut from, it would be impossible to do so without reducing Medicaid or Medicare. Some Republican lawmakers have floated the idea of cutting Medicaid by about a third over 10 years.
Meanwhile, Democrats on the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, including Hassan, estimate that roughly 24 million people would lose their health care coverage if this one-third cut went into effect, 10 million of whom would be children. In New Hampshire, that’s 60,000 people and 30,000 children.
Almost 1 million people receive medication treatment for opioid use disorder through Medicaid, according to committee Democrats. Nearly 10,000 of them live in New Hampshire. Of those 10,000, an estimated 70% or more are able to do so only through the Medicaid expansion, which New Hampshire enacted in 2014.
That expansion program is at perhaps the greatest risk in potential Medicaid cuts. This is because in 2018, New Hampshire state legislators (Medicaid is operated and funded jointly by the federal government and states) passed a trigger law which would eliminate that expansion should federal funding for the program fall below 90% of the cost of the program. This would mean an estimated 7,000 New Hampshire residents receiving opioid treatment medication through Medicaid would lose access to it.
At this month’s event, health care providers emphasized that funding substance use disorder treatment doesn’t just help people deal with their drug issues, it also prevents those issues from turning into more costly issues later on.
“People who are not in treatment end up in medical care,” Greg Baxter, president and CEO of Elliot Health System, said.
Meanwhile, fentanyl, a dangerous type of opioid drug, is ravaging communities across the U.S., including New Hampshire. Additionally, New Hampshire was among the hardest hit states in the opioid epidemic that began in the 2010s. From August 2022 to August 2023, over 110,000 Americans died from drug overdoses or poisonings, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency. In New Hampshire alone, there were 483 drug overdose deaths in 2022, the most recent data available, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. That’s 36 per 100,000 Granite Staters.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hassansubstance-1024x638.jpg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
USDA cuts hit small farms as Trump showers billions on big farms

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”











I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity



In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing already has made a comeback

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

LINCOLN — An assessment of restoring the historic Mayhew Cabin and John Brown’s Cave site in Nebraska City estimates it would cost in excess of $20 million to make it a viable attraction again.
Most of the cost, the report indicated, would be demolishing several of the seven existing structures on the site, which have been damaged by flooding and neglect.
Building a new museum to interpret the cabin, a site used by escaping slaves on the Underground Railroad during the Civil War, would cost $3 million alone, according to the assessment by the architectural firm, Clark & Enerson.
Back to Square One?
Cathleen Van Winkle, the president of the foundation that owns the Mayhew Cabin complex, said she was not surprised by the expensive repair estimate, given the extensive damage caused by flooding in 2019 and 2013.
Van Winkle, in an email on Friday, said that the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, which paid for the assessment, has told the Foundation that there is “little likelihood” that the Nebraska Legislature will appropriate money to rebuild the museum due to state budget shortfalls.
Still, she said, she’s hopeful something might be done during the current legislative session.

“If funding fails, the Foundation will have no choice but to go back to square one to begin looking for other partners and alternative plans to save the cabin and its rich history,” Van Winkle said.
Another member of the Foundation board, Robert Nelson, an Underground Railroad historian and former columnist with the Omaha World-Herald, said he’s hopeful the cabin can be saved and become part of a historic byway being developed along the “Lane Trail.” That is a Civil War-era pathway from Iowa to Kansas used by escaping slaves as well as Abolitionists — including John Brown — seeking to join the fight against pro-slavery forces in Kansas.
“We’ll do anything to save the (Mayhew) cabin,” Nelson said in an interview. “We’d love it to be as close as possible to this trail.”
Unsuccessful lawsuit
The Mayhew Cabin, which is listed on the National Park Service Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, has been closed since the 2019 flooding. The flooding prompted the Mayhew Foundation to sue unsuccessfully the City of Nebraska City, claiming it was negligent for allowing runoff from the nearby ravine to damage the site and its structures.
Other calamities have damaged the site, including a 2013 flood, a large tree that fell atop a church on the property, and a series of sewage backups at a museum structure, which has a sinking foundation. The museum also has seen two break-ins in recent years.

The recent study indicated that the underground tunnel — a “cave” that a Mayhew family member has said was used to store potatoes, not by escaping slaves — was deemed unstable and in need of replacement.
Replacement was also recommended for the museum, which the engineers estimated would cost $100,000 to demolish and $3 million for a new museum.
Also recommended to be demolished and replaced were a railroad depot, a church and a picnic shelter on the property, which are all owned by the Foundation.
Due to a lack of funds, the Foundation has been unable to make any repairs since the site was closed in 2019. In 2023, the Foundation signed a letter of intent to donate the site to the Game and Parks Commission, which led to the site assessment.
Fans have other ideas
Some fans of the Mayhew Cabin site have other ideas. That includes a Peru State professor, Sara Crook, who does historical portrayals of the older sister of John Kagi, an abolitionist who brought escaped slaves to the cabin and was a friend of John Brown.
Crook, who is on the state Hall of Fame Commission, said that in her opinion, only the Mayhew Cabin needs to be saved and preserved, which would reduce the cost of restoring the site substantially.
In an email to the Examiner, Jim Swenson, the assistant director of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, said that after meeting with the Mayhew Foundation board this week “there may be revisions in scope to reduce the cost.”
Crook also said that the Nebraska State Historical Society would be a more appropriate agency to lead the restoration, rather than the Game and Parks Commission.
Whether the cabin should remain where it is, in a flood-prone location, or moved elsewhere in Nebraska City or Lincoln or another community, is another question.
The site assessment recommended that the cabin — which was moved from its original site due to the widening of an adjacent highway — be relocated onto a more stable foundation.



Spotlight shifts to Mayhews, John Kagi
John Brown’s Cave has served as a tourist attraction since the 1930s. But over the years, the focus of the site has shifted from the cave and any connection to the famed abolitionist John Brown, to the role of the Mayhew family and of one of its relatives, John Kagi.
Kagi, who lived several months at the Mayhew Cabin, helped slaves escape northward from nearby slave states, like Missouri, to reach freedom. He was second in command to Brown during the failed raid on Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia, on Oct. 17, 1859. Kagi was killed during the raid.
Four years earlier, Kagi had lived with his sister Barbara Mayhew and her husband, Allen, at a Mayhew Cabin.
A 2002 article for the Nebraska State Historical Society’s magazine stated that Kagi had once brought 14 escaped slaves to the Nebraska City cabin, who, after eating breakfast, continued on foot northward.
A letter from Edward Mayhew, Barbara and Allen’s son, refuted earlier newspaper accounts that Brown himself had guided escaped slaves to freedom through a tunnel underneath the Mayhew cabin. The son said the cave was dug for storing potatoes, that slaves never used it and that John Brown never visited it.
The cabin was moved to its current location in 1937 to accommodate the construction of Highway 2, which has since been relocated to the south edge of Nebraska City. The tunnel beneath the cabin was dug in hopes of attracting tourists, according to a 2014 article evaluating sites on the Underground Railroad.

More than 1.7 million Michiganders live with a mental illness, yet fewer than two-thirds are getting treatment. The result is felt across emergency rooms, homeless shelters, courtrooms, and schools—places never designed to provide long-term care but now functioning as last resort.
Behind this growing crisis is a system struggling to meet the demand. Providers are overwhelmed. Psychologists, social workers, case managers, and peer specialists are stretched thin and forced to focus on administrative paperwork rather than patient care. Michiganders in all 83 counties are trying to get the care they need in their communities.
Michigan’s behavioral health system is built on a structure it can no longer support. It is fragmented, hard to navigate, and often unfair to the organizations trying to keep it together.
As the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) considers rebidding its behavioral health contracts, the state has a rare opportunity to rebuild a system that is more responsive, accountable, and equitable for everyone.
When people get into the community mental health system, they succeed.
Michigan’s community-based behavioral health system was created to keep people out of institutions and help them thrive in their communities. And when it works, it works well.
But getting into the system—and staying connected to care—isn’t easy.
One of the biggest hurdles is how services are managed and paid for. Michigan’s system is built around 10 regional Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans (PIHPs), which manage Medicaid behavioral health funding. In some regions, those PIHPs are also Community Mental Health Service Programs (CMHSPs), the entities that provide or contract services in the community. Services they can’t offer are given to community-based service providers.
The result is a model in which a single organization often acts as both the funder and the provider of care. This creates deep conflicts of interest, with serious consequences.
When your funder is your competitor, the playing field isn’t level.
Many safety net providers across the state, including those providing mental health services and substance use disorder (SUD) services, are nonprofits and are disadvantaged by the current system of care when their funder is also their competitor. There needs to be a way to create fair competition.
Under the current system, these safety net providers face lower reimbursement rates, lose staff to higher-paying public entities, and often compete for funding from the agencies delivering services themselves.
There’s also the issue of fairness. When the same entity sets the rules, delivers care, and controls the money, there’s little incentive for transparency—or accountability. Rate structures may favor internal programs. Disputes can go unresolved. And smaller, independent providers often operate without the same access to data or decision-making power.
This imbalance doesn’t just hurt organizations—it directly affects access to care. Gaps in funding and staffing mean more waitlists, fewer options, and higher barriers for people trying to get help. In a crisis, those delays can mean the difference between recovery and relapse, between housing and homelessness, or between safety and incarceration.
Administrative barriers drain time and resources.
 Despite shared goals to improve outcomes and ensure transparency, the current model often leads to fragmentation and inefficiencies. Each PIHP can impose its compliance systems, audits, and data reporting protocols. For organizations working across regions, this leads to duplication of effort and a mounting administrative load that does little to improve care quality.
Even within the same state contract framework, the interpretation and application of rules vary widely. Providers suggest aligning administrative requirements with the state’s master contract and streamlining oversight functions could significantly reduce the burden and help stabilize an already stretched workforce.
There is a path forward.
Michigan’s 2026 budget includes funding to expand Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs), higher Medicaid reimbursement rates, and workforce development. But without structural reform, those investments will fall short.
CCBHCs offer a promising model—comprehensive, no-wrong-door care that meets people where they are. However, to fulfill their promise, Michigan must ensure these clinics are accessible to experienced nonprofit providers and protected from the same funding conflicts already plaguing the system.
What’s needed now is clarity and separation of roles. Funders should not be service providers. Oversight should be independent. Every provider—regardless of affiliation—should have a fair shot at delivering care and competing for talent and services.
Why it matters.
Behavioral health reform isn’t just about systems—it’s about outcomes. When people don’t get the care they need, communities absorb the cost. Hospitals fill up. Jails become de facto treatment centers. Families lose hope. And too many Michiganders end up unhoused, unemployed, or worse.
But when the system works—when it’s fair, transparent, and community-based—it saves lives, keeps people out of crisis, and supports recovery, stability, and dignity.
The opportunity before Michigan is not just about fixing what’s broken. It’s about building a system that works for the future—one where every person, regardless of diagnosis or zip code, can access the behavioral health care they need to live a full life.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/behavioral-therapy-mental-health-GettyImages-1140393669-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

A larger-than-expected crowd went to the Ohio capitol on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump and the many controversial actions of his young administration. It was one of at least 47 across Ohio and more than 700 across the United States.
Columbus police said that the crowd appeared to approach 3,000. That was smaller than the roughly 5,000 who turned out on April 5, when millions protested nationwide. But with the Easter holiday and fewer sponsoring organizations, smaller crowds were expected on Saturday.
Large crowds also gathered in Cincinnati, rainy Akron, and other cities across the Buckeye State. They were sponsored by the group 50501.

Organizers chose April 19 to protest in part for its symbolic value. On that day in 1775, the first battles of the Revolutionary War were fought in Lexington and Concord, Mass.
Playing off of that theme, many carried signs Saturday denouncing Trump and accusing him of trying to be a king. 
Trump has been raising such concerns in several ways. They include by trying to gut the independent federal antitrust watchdog, and by empowering the world’s richest man to fire tens of thousands from the Social Security and Veterans administrations, the National Park Service, and numerous other agencies.
But perhaps more concerning is that his administration has been invoking a law not used in 80 years, accusing some migrants of membership in gangs, and deporting them to a notorious Salvadorean prison. He has defied court orders — including one to bring back a man whom the administration admitted was deported in error.
The U.S. Supreme Court early Saturday morning ordered a temporary halt to the deportations. So the stage seems to be setting for a confrontation between the judiciary — which has no army to enforce its orders — and an executive who sometimes has been disinclined to heed them.
That was on the minds of many at the Columbus protest. Chuck Ardo of Lancaster said that his family migrated to the United States from Slovakia when he was a child, and that his parents survived the Holocaust.
“Fascism is something I’ve always been aware of,” he said. “Due process and the Constitution, that’s what matters. I don’t know if these people are deportable or not. But they all deserve due process and that’s what’s missing here. They’ve labeled them ‘terrorists,’ but on what grounds? What proof have they shown?”
Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., last week visited the wrongly deported man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, at the Salvadorean prison. He said that if Trump has evidence that Abrego Garcia is in a gang, he needs to present it court — not just claim it on social media.
For Ardo, Trump’s actions have a disturbing historical echo.
“Donald Trump is doing many of the things Hitler did as he rose to power,” he said. “Hitler attacked the courts. He attacked the universities. I’m not accusing anybody of being a Nazi here, but while history doesn’t repeat itself, it rhymes.”
Debbie Wood of Powell said the president has been acting like a king in other ways as well.
“Trump did not win in a landslide,” she said. “More people voted for someone else than for him. He does not have a mandate. Even the people who voted for him did not vote to ruin the VA. They didn’t vote to fire people who do cancer research. They didn’t vote to take food out of the mouths of hungry people. Ruining the national parks. Nobody voted for any of that stuff.”
She added, “People are getting more and more angry. He’s sending people away to concentration camps without due process. Ignoring court orders. Who does that? We would be in jail.”

Gary Bennett of St. Clairsville stood at the base of a monument to former President William McKinley holding a sign that mocked Trump and slammed him for gutting the staff at the National Park Service. He said that’s just one problem among many he has with the new administration.
“We could make signs every day of the week and there would still be signs to make,” he said. “Me and my wife just retired, and we don’t want him to take away our Social Security. That’s just one thing.”
Chris Glass of Delaware said she’s also upset about many things Trump is doing, and that protesting helps.
“There is something very nice about the camaraderie,” she said. “It’s a sense that people do care. I think we represent the country better than our current government does.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250419_124710-1024x626.jpg,,,2025-04-21 06:04:19.793035

Getty Images.A recent report from an Ohio-based health institute emphasizes the importance of prevention and testing after decades of study and treatment on HIV, calling it a “pressing public health concern in the United States” as the Trump administration proposes eliminating research and programs on the disease.
According to the Equitas Health Institute’s study on HIV research, the pressing public health concern is being faced by young adults the most, with the age group ranging from the early teens to early 30s accounting for 58% of the estimated 32,100 new HIV diagnoses in 2021.
The importance of sex education and awareness of HIV status is always important, researchers said, but in the current political climate, “HIV is often caught in the crossfire of health care debates and shifting policies.”
“Access to funding resources, education and prevention programs is inconsistent and, in many areas, highly inadequate,” the study found. “Navigating sexual health is about building resilience and showing young adults that they are not defined by a diagnosis, the politics surrounding sexual health, or the uncertainty of living with HIV.”
The study comes as the Trump Administration sets its sights on HIV research as part of vast funding cuts within the federal government. Funding is already gone for HIV-related research grants within the National Institutes of Health, including research at U.S. universities and international efforts.
Of the terminated grants, two went to the Ohio State University for studies on “the influence of developmental assets on intersectional stigma and HIV prevention in Black (men who have sex with men)” and a study on “client and clinician priorities” regarding two HIV prevention medications.
Cuts to research and funding
But more chops may be coming as the Trump administration plans to restructure the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services could include elimination of federal HIV prevention and research programs. Those cuts could include the “Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America” initiative, a government move that aimed to reduce new HIV infections by 90% by 2030.
The initiative was started under the previous Trump administration, but the CDC web page on the initiative now mentions a court order requiring the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to restore the website as of Feb. 14. Text at the top of the page then claims any information on the page “promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female.”
“The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children,” the page now states, adding that it “does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this department rejects it.”
HIV is a disease that attacks the immune system by going after white blood cells, which can develop into the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. Symptoms don’t always present with HIV, so testing is necessary to identify it, according to Equitas Health.
AIDS wasn’t formally identified in the U.S. until the 1980s, and even then, researchers said governmental response was “minimal,” and then-President Ronald Reagan wouldn’t use the term until 1985.
Community response came in the form of a grassroots effort called ACT UP in 1987, and in 1990, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program was established for low-income individuals living with HIV, an organization that exists to this day, currently housed under the U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration. The Ohio Department of Health still houses a Ryan White Part B Program for HIV-related services, funded through federal grants, according to the state.
The first treatment method for AIDS was approved in 1996, and cases of the disease began decreasing after the first antiretroviral therapy was released, addressing a disease that was then the leading cause of death for all American adults ages 25-44.
Though the HIV/AIDS epidemic was connected to gay men from the moment it was officially identified, data from the early 1990s showed the disease was present in other groups, including members of various genders, sexualities, races, socio-economic levels and health statuses, according to Equitas Health.
Prevention efforts were started at the local and state public health level, as well as in partnerships between the CDC and national minority organizations.
Testing is an “essential component of HIV prevention, treatment and care,” according to the report, and a lack of awareness about the illness “contributes to the spread of HIV, as individuals who are unaware of their infection statues are more likely to engage in behaviors that can transmit the virus to others.”
“Barriers to testing include stigma, lack of awareness and limited access to testing services,” the report stated. “Stigma may occur within the patient, their community or health care providers.”
Ohio law effective since 2012 requires the Ohio Department of Health to develop and administer AIDS and HIV-related programs, including a system to determine the number of cases, development of counseling and testing programs, risk reduction/education programs to at-risk groups and pilot programs for long-term care.
A treatment now exists to prevent HIV transmission, and the FDA approved the first HIV home-testing kit in 2012, with the CDC funding nearly 2 million tests per year, according to 2021 data.
“Despite medications improving lives and reducing transmission, there is still no cure for the disease,” researchers at Equitas Health stated. “There are two objectives in HIV research: sustained viral suppression without medication and total eradication of the virus.”
Even with improved treatment and testing, HIV rates began to increase during the 2010s, researchers stated, pointing to young adults as a disproportionately affected group.
Sex education
A lack of required sex education also has impacts, according to the report. Sex education in Ohio has been seen as lacking in many ways, with advocates for sex education increasing the push for requirements after Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the 1970s was overturned, and the discussion of reproductive rights and sexual health was put to individual states.
Ohio law regarding education curricula including sex education has been changed numerous times over the years, with the most recent change enacted in October 2024. That change came via the Republican-led Senate Bill 168, which, among other education-related changes, amended references in Ohio law from “venereal disease” education to “sexually transmitted infection” education.
A bill passed last year was harshly criticized for forcing school districts to notify parents if a child identifies as LGBTQ+ and allowing parents to opt out of “sexuality content.” During the committee process in the Senate, however, an amendment was added to the bill to specify that content the bill deemed objectionable was not targeting STI education.
While STI education is in Ohio law, advocates for more sexual education say abstinence-focused instruction and the other provisions currently in law aren’t enough.
The non-profit Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States said Ohio’s sex education curriculum”is not required to be comprehensive, medically accurate or include instruction on topics such as consent, sexual orientation or gender identity, or contraceptive options.”
“This leaves local school districts to decide what sex education curriculum they provide,” the group stated.
The research from Equitas Health recognized the resilience of young adults, despite being a population that is understudied among HIV study.
“Young adults with marginalized identities require diverse and targeted approaches within HIV care,” the report concluded. “However, adults within sexual, gender and racial minority groups are often excluded from HIV discourse. The unique needs of young adults must be considered.”

(Photo courtesy of Maria Wilkinson)In 2015, just four months after graduating from Concord High, I arrived in California to begin a year of service to my country. Not through the military or college, but through AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) — a program that would change my life in ways I never expected.
On our first day, we were told: “You’re not here to help others — you’re here for yourselves.” At first, that felt selfish. But over the next 10 months, I came to understand what that meant. Yes, we were serving others — but through that service, we were also learning, growing, and transforming ourselves.
I was assigned to the West Coast campus and placed on a team with 11 other young people from all across the country. We lived together, cooked together, worked out together — and most importantly, we served together.
In Montana, we helped build homes with Habitat for Humanity. In California, we spent months clearing brush to reduce wildfire risk. In Utah, we served as camp counselors for individuals with disabilities. On weekends, we volunteered in local communities — cooking Sunday breakfasts at churches, planting trees to prevent erosion, cleaning up community gardens.
We lived on less than $200 a month. We didn’t join AmeriCorps for the money — we joined because we wanted to be part of something bigger than ourselves. I wasn’t ready for college right out of high school. I needed to see more of the world first. AmeriCorps NCCC gave me that chance.
This program taught me what it really means to serve my country — not just through military service or government jobs, but through compassion, manual labor, teamwork, and meeting people where they are.
That’s why it’s devastating to see AmeriCorps NCCC being defunded and dismantled. Doing so doesn’t just take away a year of service — it takes away a path of purpose, growth, and opportunity for thousands of young Americans.
Cutting AmeriCorps NCCC isn’t a budgetary win. It’s a national loss.
To the young people who won’t be able to finish their year of service, and to those who will never get the chance to start: I’m sorry. You deserve this opportunity. And our country needs programs like this more than ever.
AmeriCorps Mission Statement:
I will get things done for America — to make our people safer, smarter, and healthier.

A Republican Ohio Senator wants higher education appropriations to be tied to compliance to Senate Bill 1, the new higher education law banning diversity efforts and regulating classroom discussion that will take effect this summer. 
“We’re not kidding around,” State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said Thursday during a City Club of Cleveland forum. “This law will not be ignored. It will be welcomed. … We’re going to make sure that all the work we’ve done doesn’t go to waste because it’s being ignored. We’re going to make sure it happens and nothing speaks like money.”

The new law will ban diversity efforts, prohibit faculty strikes, regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things.  
Cirino introduced S.B. 1 earlier this year which quickly passed the Ohio Senate and House. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law at the end of March and it will take effect on June 27. Members of the Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association are collecting signatures in the hopes of trying to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot. 
“Opponents of Senate Bill 1 have said it will destroy higher education in Ohio,” Cirino said. “Well, the governor signed the bill a couple of weeks ago, and to my knowledge, higher education is still pretty well intact in the state of Ohio.” 
More than 1,500 people testified against S.B. 1 — including many college students, faculty and staff who said they would leave Ohio if this bill became law. 
“Certainly for some of them that would be OK,” Cirino said. “Some of the ones who came to testify, I will help them pack.” 
The Ohio Capital Journal recently talked to a Cleveland State University student who is transferring to a New York university after spring semester because of the new law. 
Cirino talked about the need for a higher education law like this given “the predominance of left-leaning faculty, which has skewed things on our campuses.”
“Without the very best educational system, we will not have a properly trained workforce, and without a trained workforce, we will not have a robust economy here in Ohio,” Cirino said. “If our universities and community colleges are fixated on DEI, separating students by race and hiring professors who follow a monolithic liberal agenda, we are not preparing our students to learn how to analyze research and come to their own conclusions.”
Cirino said the new law creates more opportunities for speech, reiterated that it’s not anti-union and makes education available to everyone. 
“Some of our universities have been spending tens of millions of dollars on infrastructure for DEI which has become institutional discrimination,” he said. “You can’t solve discrimination by having other discrimination. The best way to eliminate discrimination is to eliminate discrimination.”
The new law also bans faculty strikes, something Cirino said is a student rights issue, not a labor issue. 
“When a student signs up for a semester and pays for it, that’s a contract between them and the university,” he said. “Nothing should interrupt that. Nothing at all.”
Even though the law only applies to Ohio’s public universities and community colleges, private colleges would be required to comply with parts of S.B.1 if they want to continue to participate in the Governor’s Merit Scholarship, according to language from the House’s version of the budget. The budget is now in the hands of the Senate where Cirino is the chair of the Senate Finance Committee.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks, and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel, and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes, and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care, and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia, and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology, and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Ron Estes (second from right) poses with other U.S. representatives during a trip to El Salvador last week. (U.S. Embassy in El Salvador)We do not elect kings in Kansas or the United States.
We do not dole out justice through lynch mobs or popularity contests either.
Yet there U.S. Rep. Ron Estes stood in a picture from the U.S. embassy in El Salvador, lending tacit approval to a mob that has all but condemned Maryland father Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to death, at the behest of a would-be tyrant in Washington, D.C.
The facts of the case are simple and damning. Garcia was sent to a gulag without due proxies of law, and President Donald Trump’s administration has defied a 9-0 Supreme Court order in keeping him there. The White House has attempted to smear the man in absentia, with all the crudeness of those who used to accuse Black boys of taking liberties with white women.
This, apparently, is fine and dandy with Estes.

On Tuesday, Republican Reps. Jason Smith of Missouri and Riley Moore of West Virginia posed proudly in pictures from CECOT — the notorious El Salvadoran mega-prison where the United States has shipped hundreds without due process. Estes did not post such pictures. However, the 4th District congressman stood in a lineup with Smith and Moore in an image posted Wednesday by the embassy, along with Reps. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, Mike Kennedy of Utah, Carol Miller of West Virginia and Claudia Tenney of New York.
Credit must go at this point to independent journalist and Kansas Reflector friend Marisa Kabas, who first reported about the Republicans’ visit. She reached out to the lawmakers for comment, hearing back only from Hearn’s office: “We cannot confirm or comment on the Congressman’s location for security purposes.” Tenney subsequently tweeted that she had also toured CECOT.
I reached out via email to Estes spokesman Roman Rodriguez to ask whether the representative had gone to the prison or was concerned about Garcia’s welfare. He did not respond.

Prison pipeline
We cannot close our eyes to the brutal reality of CECOT or El Salvador’s government.
According to Ana Piquer, Americas director at Amnesty International: “El Salvador is implementing a systematic state policy of massive and arbitrary deprivation of liberty. After three years, more than 85,000 individuals remain behind bars without sufficient admissible evidence, the victims of a judicial system now transformed into a tool for collective punishment and widespread repression. Attempts to export this policy to the situation of Venezuelan migrants and refugees in the United States highlights the lack of protection and the risk that hundreds of thousands of people now face of having their human rights violated by not one, not two, but three different states.”
You can’t confuse this gulag with any kind of American facility. In our country, attorneys and law enforcement must still abide by the law. Not in El Salvador. Conditions there go beyond mere cruelty.
Officials have decided to create a concentration camp, one in which prisoners are denied due process and tortured.
In the words of Human Rights Watch: “People held in CECOT, as well as in other prisons in El Salvador, are denied communication with their relatives and lawyers, and only appear before courts in online hearings, often in groups of several hundred detainees at the same time. The Salvadoran government has described people held in CECOT as ‘terrorists,’ and has said that they ‘will never leave.’ Human Rights Watch is not aware of any detainees who have been released from that prison.”
Juanita Goebertus Estrada, director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, said that while the mega-prison was built more recently than other facilities in the country, he understands that conditions are similar to other prisons in the country.
“This includes cases of torture, ill-treatment, incommunicado detention, severe violations of due process and inhumane conditions, such as lack of access to adequate healthcare and food,” he said.
No one should go to such a facility. Not even the most notorious criminals, of any country or any citizenship status. No one.

Trump temper tantrum
Regardless of pushback from courts at every level, President Donald Trump has persisted in his quest to send immigrants out of this country and to the most brutal and dehumanizing conditions.
No matter their ideology or party, our elected officials must step up and speak out against such authoritarian violence. Estes, during his visit to El Salvador, had every opportunity to do so. He could have joined Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen in meeting with Garcia and urging his immediate release from detention. He could have spoken up for the rule of law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as codified by the United Nations.
Instead, he posed for the picture and made no public comment. He lent his silent assent to a governmental lynching.
Garcia may have been a gang member. He may have beaten his wife. He may have leaked the COVID-19 virus from a lab and caused Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis to bomb at the box office. Any or all of these stories may be true. But he has been convicted of none of them. If the Trump administration actually believes such accusations against Garcia, bring him back and criminally charge him.
Due process of law means due process for everyone, citizens and noncitizens alike. Respect for the rule of law means respecting all court decisions, even those with which you disagree. Without following these precepts, our democratic society crumbles. You support the ruthless mob, willing to hang a man on mere suspicion.
Estes might be OK with that. On his website, he touts support for a bill that would strip power from judges. The same figures tasked with defending the rights of everyone.
Perhaps he has decided to declare fealty to a king rather than support a mere president.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Nebraska’s 13 private colleges and universities might do well to keep an eye on Harvard University’s recent resounding “no” to the president who wants the feds to have a say in the school’s inner workings, including teaching and hiring. 
Harvard’s hard pass meant the federal government froze $2.2 billion earmarked for the nation’s most recognizable university, primarily for scientific and medical research including work in artificial intelligence, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s — areas in which Harvard is recognized as a leader. As of this writing, the president is also threatening to yank the school’s tax exempt status, something he can’t do unilaterally.
What the White House wants is essentially a measure of control at Harvard. It has dressed that demand as a worthy cause: the elimination of antisemitism on campus. In a letter to the Cambridge university, the government accused Harvard of not having the correct “intellectual and civil rights conditions” to allow further federal funds to make their way to the famed campus. 
The letter also demanded that the college name names by reporting to the feds students “who are ‘hostile’ to American values” and require — without explanation — academic departments to be something called “viewpoint diverse” and hire government-approved auditors to see if any programs, policies or departments “fuel antisemitic harassment.”
Harvard stands firm
Whew! And that was only part of the ultimatum. Finding the directives out of line with the mission of the university, Harvard stood firm. The university’s president said, “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach. … The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”
Most of Harvard’s massive endowment is earmarked for specific projects. Even so perhaps more than any other private school in the nation, it is financially equipped to meet the challenge of such defunding. Surely, a Creighton or a Midland or a Concordia would have to meet such pressure in another way.
Harvard is one of nearly 60 colleges and universities under scrutiny by the federal government for practices the government alleges might contribute to anti-semitism. Efforts to curb that distemper are smart and justified when and where they are needed. Indeed, some of the five dozen colleges and universities, including Harvard, have made changes toward protecting Jewish students who feel threatened on campus. 
While none of Nebraska’s private colleges and universities made the list, the University of Nebraska at Omaha was notified by the Trump administration last month that it was under investigation for “race exclusionary practices” having to do with the awarding of scholarships to graduate students. UNO had closed its DEI office in February. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln closed its DEI office in August 2024. Even so, a bill in the Nebraska Legislature to outlaw any office of diversity, equity and inclusion on any public college campus in the state hasn’t gained much traction to date.
Part of broader battle
The battle for the soul of post-secondary education, however, is old news. Many on the right see colleges as breeding grounds for what they see as the scourge of “woke” culture, a pedagogical petri dish growing an array of evil anagrams from DEI to CRT to ESG. Campus protests over Gaza since late 2023 have stoked these culture war fires. Two years earlier, eventual vice-president J.D. Vance famously said, “the universities are the enemy.”  
I spent four years as a member of the adjunct faculty and part of the academic support staff at Hastings College, a small private institution in south-central Nebraska. “HC” is a beautiful campus, not unlike a New England setting, nestled in a neighborhood just north and east of downtown Hastings. 
Hastings College is obviously not Harvard, nor is it a big public system such as the University of Nebraska. The task there, however, was similar: train young minds to think critically, research thoroughly and act decisively on the outcome of each. I’m also happy to say that I saw diversity, equity and inclusion — intentional and otherwise — fostered and celebrated. 
The mission of a college is a goal, not always the exact outcome. And individual college experiences don’t always live up to expectations. But when campuses are diverse, vibrant and vital places, when they challenge students and faculty to be the best versions of themselves, when they get it right, when the lights brighten, the research adds up and the solutions solve problems, the rest of the world is better for it … whether it’s Harvard University or Hastings College. 
Hardly enemies of the American people and no place for the feds to interfere.

Photo submitted by Chattahoochee Riverkeeper. Photo submitted by Chattahoochee RiverkeeperRoutine water sampling conducted by the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper as part of a federal partnership revealed alarming levels of bacteria discharged into the river by Fulton County’s largest wastewater treatment plant in 2023.
The Georgia Environmental Protection Division issued several violations and a $300,000 fine against the city of Atlanta for maintenance problems causing numerous illegal discharges of pollution at the RM Clayton Water Reclamation Facility in northwest Atlanta.
Chattahoochee Riverkeeper’s Chris Manganiello considers the Fulton County pollution drama as a reason to sound the alarm over the now-uncertain future of the U.S. Geological Survey’s South Atlantic Water Science Center in Norcross.
The center’s lease recently appeared on the Elon Musk-led U.S. Department of Government Efficiency’s list for possible terminations by the end of 2025, but it’s still unclear what that means for the staff and the program’s mission.
The U.S. General Services Administration, which manages federal property, did not respond to the Recorder’s emailed questions about the terms of the lease and the fate of the staff.
Since the early 2000s, the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper and the federal agency have collaborated on the BacteriALERT program that provides live updates to the public of the amount of E. coli contamination in a river that is a source of drinking water for millions of Georgians.
“Eventually after working with Fulton County, they came to an agreement with us that their plant was not functioning,” Manganiello said. “This is a situation where we’re pretty sure that we wouldn’t have identified this problem without the help of collection from USGS sources.”
Environmentalists and Democratic congressional members are expressing concerns about the planned lease termination, which the DOGE website says will save the federal government more than $1.3 million.
The center is one of more than a dozen government offices in Georgia that could have its leases ended under the Trump administration’s cuts.
Riverkeeper members said that water gauges are essential for maintaining compliance with state and federal permits. The data collected by these gauges tracks flood levels and the National Weather Service contracts with the center to collect rainfall data.
Manganiello, the Riverkeeper water policy director, said that the closure of the Norcross office and potential layoffs could at a minimum disrupt water monitoring for several months, which could lead to a significant decline in water quality and compliance.
“It’s one thing if we all knew they’re going to close this office because they moved into another location, that would be okay,” he said. “But because we don’t know what’s going to happen if the lease is terminated and these people don’t have a place to physically work, that means there’s going to be a disruption in the maintenance of the physical equipment and to data collection and data processing.”
Chattahoochee Riverkeeper Jason Ulseth said the center operates water flow gauges essential for monitoring everything from bacteria to water flooding levels impacting water management in Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
“This science center is critical for many reasons, including the fact that they run all of the flow gauges for Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina,” Ulseth said. “These flow gauges tell us how much water is in any part of the river throughout the system and is essential to municipal water to decision makers, dam operators, (utility) power operators and fishermen.”
The government water monitoring benefits the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, which draws 3.5 million annual visitors.
The scientific water surveying covers a 48-mile stretch between the Buford Dam and Atlanta. The employees also track water levels, flooding and dam releases at the Buford Dam.
“They’re fishing, they’re tubing, they’re kayaking,” Ulseth said. “So the health of the river and the amount of pathogens that are in the river are very important to the people that are going there. With the bacteria alert program, we are able to actually predict the current levels of E. coli and give public health advisories in real time, which is a one-of-a-kind program in the entire country.”
Atlanta Democratic U.S. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock expressed their concerns about potential layoffs in a letter to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.
The relocation plans remain unclear despite the office lease set to terminate in a few months, the senators wrote Tuesday.
“Staff at the (center) perform water quality testing to ensure the safety of drinking water and maintain water gauges across Georgia, including Lake Sidney Lanier and on the Chattahoochee River, which supplies most of metro Atlanta’s drinking water,” Ossoff and Warnock wrote. “Local officials in metro Atlanta rely on gauges at Lake Lanier to ensure enough water is drawn from the lake to provide water to millions of Georgians every day. These gauges also inform water flows for Georgia’s agriculture industry, nuclear reactors across the state, and Department of Defense installations, among others.”
The potential ramifications of staff layoffs at the Norcross science center is also being watched closely by Suwannee Riverkeeper John Quarterman in south Georgia.
He said his organization relies on the data to predict the risk of flooding in areas like the Skipper Bridge on the Withlacoochee River north of Valdosta.
“It will be a problem for flood preparedness if (flood mapping) goes away, or if either of those gauges does,” Quarterman said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The environment in Pierre today is “more strident” than it was when David Owen began lobbying South Dakota lawmakers in 1998. Much has changed since then, Owen said, but that’s been the biggest shift.
Owen said Pierre’s deeply divided political environment, particularly among Republicans, is one where policy debates turn personal. He describes it as “a cancer in the system.”
“We used to have battles, take the vote, then go on and see each other at dinner. Those days are gone,” Owen said.  
Owen, 70, is retiring. He’s been president of the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry for nearly three decades, representing the state’s business interests in and out of the Capitol building. Before that, he worked for various Midwest chambers, including in Kansas and Montana.
Owen’s favorite part of the job has always been explaining the policymaking process, whether to state lawmakers or a boardroom of business leaders. He’s known for his sharp wit and policy knowledge, and has earned a reputation for occasionally breaking from the pack, especially when compromise or principle demanded it.
Ahead of his August exit from professional life, Owen sat down with South Dakota Searchlight to reflect on the art of lobbying, shifts in the Legislature, and what he sees as both the promise and peril of South Dakota politics. 
The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
What made you interested in lobbying lawmakers?
I’ve always been interested in policy and politics. So I chose chambers that were involved in those kinds of issues. 
I was going to be a teacher. And what I like about what I’ve done is that I teach every day. 
I teach legislators the perspective of the chamber, which gets difficult at times. And I have to teach my board about the issues and pressures around us. Because my board’s full of really smart people, successful business people, who get frustrated with the ups and downs of politics. 
What is the biggest misconception about lobbying?
There’s this idea that the lobbyists always win.
We do have a tremendous advantage over citizens who come to the Legislature. It’s something I’m uneasy about. A bill has its hearing, and then they vote on the bill. That means a lot of citizens show up to say “Me too” and bring their concerns. They’ve got their piece of paper. They’ve never done this before. They’re really nervous. 
Meanwhile, the paid lobbyists, including the one you’re talking to, already have a pretty good idea what the vote’s going to be, because we’re there all day. We catch legislators in the hall. We don’t bribe anybody, but we’re familiar with them. 
South Dakota is increasingly becoming pay-to-play. They do fundraisers and we have a political action committee, but legislators are independent enough that we don’t have the kind of control over them that the public seems to think. Otherwise, nobody would lose.
This year, I was talking to some of the freshmen legislators who had never served before. 
I heard from like five of them, the same answer that was pretty different than in the past. I asked the question, “What prompted you to run?”
I heard more about concerns about “society” and how they thought they could help straighten out “the culture” by being in the Legislature. That’s a big task. That brings you to introducing things like school vouchers. That brings you to thinking the Ten Commandments in every classroom will help structure a moral code that will solve some of these social problems. 
And there are two influential lobbying groups up there, we’ve got more, but two groups in particular, that have added to the schism: the abortion people and the gun people. They don’t reach across any aisle. 
Other lobbying groups, like the chamber, are involved in all kinds of business. We’re involved in a whole bunch of issues. We’ve got lobbyists that are banging on each other on one issue, working together on another. The abortion people don’t do that. The NRA doesn’t do that. Instead, they send nasty postcards out. 
You used to be a Republican and later registered as an independent. Why?
What finally got me to pull the trigger on leaving the party was Merrick Garland’s proposed nomination to the Supreme Court, him not getting a hearing. Because Republicans were all saying you can’t do this when there’s a presidential election. 
And then, with unbelievable speed, closer to the election than that, Republicans got Amy Coney Barrett confirmed. And that was perfectly OK.
I just thought, “I don’t think we have any principles here.” 
I had run ballot campaigns 12, 13 times in two states by then. I get roughness. I get things getting ugly. But I’d like to think that we have some principles that we will stand by, and that just flushed it out of me. 
How has the business of lobbying itself changed?
My wife, Debra, who had been a lobbyist for the local chamber, was recently terminated. So, she spent some time as a contract lobbyist. 
And I now understand this whole game of contract lobbying better. So, I don’t know if I’m noticing changes or if I’m better educated.
In the world of contract lobbying, you have two camps. You have a camp where people are coming to certain lobbyists because they have a reputation of being very effective. And they charge a certain range, starting around $20,000 and it goes up. And then some people are just starting, kind of looking for clients.
It’s interesting to me the number of out-of-state groups, national groups, that have some agenda and are hiring these contract lobbyists. 
There’s more people with money forming groups, that in turn hire lobbyists to do, quite honestly, some fairly obscure crap. 
For example, another lobbyist reached out to me, and he had a group of trailer manufacturers who wanted to change one of our laws that requires trailer manufacturers to be affiliated with dealerships. 
So, this group in some orbit around some star finds him and says, “Can you help us change this?”
What are the right reasons to want to become a lobbyist? 
I’ve done what I’ve done for 45-plus years, 27 sessions, because I’m called to stand in this scene between business and government. 
I have profound respect for people who work for the public. I have great respect for my members and my board members. They’re two totally different systems. The balance sheet for legislators is how they vote and how they feel. That’s not a balance sheet for a business. 
My advice is to deal with facts. Listen. You can learn a lot. Be yourself, unless you’re an a—–. And know why you’re there, but respect and try to learn why other people are there. 
Every time we find something in the law that looks really stupid, I go back to when it passed. Every mistake we’ve made, we made on purpose. There was a reason that they convinced everybody in 1920 to vote for, I don’t know, tying up horses. 
I think the right reason is to solve problems. If you’re there sincerely, I think that’s the right thing. I don’t like the process when it sinks to the level of win-at-all-costs. I don’t like when it gets abusive – when they’re sending out postcards cards because they found out a lawmaker against their cause was picked up for a DUI when they were 18 years old. 
The wrong reason is just wanting to publicly humiliate those opposing your cause. That makes good people fearful of getting involved. And we’re going through some of that right now. 
The Republican Party is clearly divided into two sides. Right to Life, the NRA, the carbon pipeline people, those groups like to send out nasty cards. I think that’s a cancer in this system. If you’ve got to do that to win, I wish you’d find another occupation.

The planned casino will sit near the border of Ada and Elmore counties in southwest Idaho. (Courtesy of the Shoshone-Pauite Tribes)The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes are developing their first resort and casino along Interstate 84 halfway between Boise and Mountain Home.
For decades, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes were the only tribe in Idaho without revenue. But the proposed resort and casino is estimated to generate tens of millions of dollars annually for Idaho’s economy and create thousands of regional jobs. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes also plan to share 5% of their net gaming revenues to support local schools and education programs.
Shoshone-Paiute Chairman Brian Mason said in a press release he dreams of a future where tribal members have the resources, education, health care and employment opportunities they need to sustain their families and preserve their culture.
“Today, we have no meaningful economic opportunities and our community is facing some heavy challenges because of it,” Mason said. “We want to solve our own problems and provide for our people. Tribal gaming will allow us to make these dreams into a reality.”
Shoshone-Paiute Tribes partner with Coeur d’Alene Tribe
The tribes are partnering with the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, who has successfully run gaming operations in North Idaho for more than 30 years.
The Coeur d’Alene Tribe is providing a large upfront investment to help with the permitting and development process, and once it is built, the Tribe will enter into a management contract with the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes to help sustain the casino.
Coeur d’Alene Chairman Chief Allan said the tribe is honored to help its “brothers and sisters” secure the same benefits they have experienced from gaming.
“When I was growing up, many tribal members lived in poverty and could not find jobs,” Allan said in the press release. “Today, we have a state-of-the-art medical center, ample employment for tribal members and can financially support every tribal member who wants to earn a college degree. None of this would be possible without tribal gaming.”
Tribal gaming already contributes more than $1.4 billion of annual economic activity to the state, over $47 million in annual tax revenue and it sustains 12,500 Idaho jobs, according to a press release from the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes.
Tribe chairman says casino will provide resources to strengthen community
The Duck Valley Indian Reservation spans about 450 square miles in the southwest corner of Idaho, half split into parts of Nevada.
The tribes, according to the press release, face high rates of suicide and unemployment, and given its isolated location in the high desert, the Shoshone-Paiute community struggles to provide emergency services to its members.
Medical emergencies require lifesaving air transportation to Boise, which takes at least 45 minutes. A typical 911 call can take two hours to be answered because there are no tribal law enforcement officers exclusively dedicated to serving Duck Valley. Education funding is another major issue, and the school cannot attract enough certified teachers because of limited housing and other resources in the area, according to the press release
“The challenges we face daily are not insurmountable. We simply need resources to invest in long-term solutions for our people,” Mason said. “Gaming will give us the tools we need to strengthen our community, grow our infrastructure and provide more opportunities to our youth for generations to come.”
The planned location is where the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes used to live, hunt and care for the natural resources. The planned casino will include gaming machines, luxury hotel rooms, a spa, entertainment center and fine dining options.
To build this project on tribal land outside of the reservation, the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes will follow the established process set out by the U.S. Department of the Interior and plan to submit their initial application later this year.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
On March 17, Beson was noticed walking on Village Road near Wayman Lane toward Hwy. 47 on the Lac du Flambeau Reservation.
Six days later, family members reported Beson missing on March 23.
Beson was last seen wearing red sweatpants, a black sleeveless shirt, and a gray sweatshirt. She is a Native American female, 5’7”, with a medium build, brown hair, and brown eyes. She has numerous tattoos on her neck, arms, and legs.
Ground searches began on March 24 and 25, and aerial and underwater drones covered the Bear River in the vicinity where Beson was last seen.
Over 360 surveillance cameras positioned near tribal properties and monitored by full-time police employees had recorded footage reviewed without any evidence of Beson.
Subsequent ground searches were hampered by the heavy snowfall, but since most of the snow has melted, ground searches have resumed.
Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Chief TJ Bill reports that on April 16, a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) plane provided aerial coverage, and he expects the DNR aircraft will again be available on Monday, April 21.
So far, Bill said, searchers have covered over 824 acres of forest.
“We are not saying she is out in the forest, but we need to make sure, and this is why we are doing the searches,” said Bill.
Recently police received reports that Beson was seen in the Wausau area. 
Beson’s mother, Winifred Ann Beson, “Winnie,” told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday, April 8, that her daughter might be with friends and she noted her daughter also likes to travel to other states, but in the past, Beson has always stayed in communication.
“Usually, she calls me if she needs money or is in trouble, but she hasn’t called me,” she said.
“We have been getting numerous reports Melissa is in the Wausau area,” said Bill, “but nothing has been substantiated. We have our officers travelling to Wausau and other areas.”  
Beson’s mother also said she is afraid Melissa might have been kidnapped by human traffickers. Native Americans have been targeted by human traffickers who prey on vulnerable populations where there is poverty and high drug use.
According to the Indian Law Resource Center, Native American women experience the highest rates of sexual assault of any group and are10 times more likely to experience domestic violence than white women. On some reservations, Native American women are murdered at a rate that is 10 times the national average. 
The missing and murdered Indigenous women plus relatives (MMIW/R) movement has strived to raise awareness of the plight of Indigenous people in North America. 
May 5 is Red Dress Day,  a national day of awareness for MMIW/R.
Wisconsin has a MMIW/R Task Force that is part of the Department of Justice, but Wisconsin doesn’t have a full time office as in Minnesota, which monitors  MMIW/R cases, assists families,  coordinates information for r law enforcement agencies and offers rewards for information.
Concerning the search for Beson, Bill said his office has one officer dedicated to the case who is also coordinating the searches with the help of the tribe’s emergency management office.
“Our two detectives are spending the majority of their time on the case, working social media search warrants for cellular telephones (Verizon), Facebook, Snap Chat and Google, working with these entities on past history locations,” said Bill. “If we’re not handling current cases/calls coming into the PD, we are working this case non-stop.”
Bill said the public may be invited to help in the search for Beson, but he is concerned that volunteers stay safe in the large forest where it is easy to become disoriented and lost.
“These areas are dangerous to the novice, and we cannot afford the volunteers to work the swamp and bog areas,” he said. “There is still some ground freeze, but areas of the swamps have thawed areas with deep mud. We got stuck at times [Thursday] in the swamps.  When safe and weather conditions are good, we will ask for volunteer support.”
Anyone with any information regarding Beson’s whereabouts should call the Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department at (715) 588-7717 or Vilas County Sheriff’s Office at (715) 479-4441.
Acknowledgements
Bill wanted to acknowledge organizations that have helped with  the search for Beson.
“We literally have thousands of hours into this investigation, which involves so many entities, not just ourselves,” said Bill.
Organizations that have helped include:
LDF Emergency Management, LDF Tribal Roads,  LDF Tribal Wardens, LDF Natural Resources, LDF Victim Services, LDF Economic Support, LDF Prosecutor, Newbold Fire Search and Rescue, LDF Fire and EMS, Arbor Vitae Fire and EMS, Vilas County Sheriff’s Office and Dispatch, Vilas County Sheriff’s Office Jail, Vilas County IT Department, LDF IT Department, Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Office, DNR, Wisconsin Emergency Management, Wausau Police Department, Mountain Bay Metro Police, Taylor County Sheriff’s Office, Medford Police Department, Forest County Sheriff’s Office, Crandon Police Department, Kenosha County Sheriff’s Office, Atkins County Sheriff’s Office – Minnesota, Milwaukee High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) agency, Vilas County Emergency Management, State of Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigation, State of Wisconsin Department of Corrections Probation and Parole, Lake of the Torches Casino surveillance, Missing Murdered, Indigenous, plus Relatives  (MMIW/R) Wisconsin Task Force, and Native American Drug and Gang Initiative (NADGI) Task Force.

(John Gray / Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill is pushing forward with her efforts to force Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson to drop a longtime policy that generally prohibits deputies from directly engaging in federal immigration enforcement within the city’s jail.
In legal filings, Murrill claims the policy — which the state characterizes as a so-called “sanctuary city” policy —  is in direct conflict with a newly passed state law that requires state and local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.
“The consent decree now sits fundamentally at odds with state law as applicable to immigration detainers,” Murrill said in court documents filed Friday (April 11).
A federal court will now determine whether to allow the state of Louisiana to join a 2011 federal suit that resulted in the policy and whether to throw out the policy altogether. A hearing has been set for April 30.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The state’s campaign against “sanctuary” policies comes as President Donald Trump is pushing local law enforcement agencies to join the federal government in his promised immigration crackdown. Since his inauguration, Trump has ordered the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to push for more partnerships between local law enforcement units and federal immigration agencies. A few have already signed up. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a longtime immigration hardliner and Trump ally, has worked with Republican lawmakers in the state to enact laws that encourage those collaborations.
As attorney general, Landry criticized a policy adopted by the New Orleans Police Department, under a long-running federal consent decree that blocks officers from enforcing immigration laws.
Neither Murrill’s office nor representatives for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to requests for comment.
In court filings, Murrill said Hutson “does not oppose the [state’s] intervention” in the case.” But a spokesperson for Hutson said that’s not exactly true.
“It’s more accurate that we take no position regarding the state intervention,” a Sheriff’s Office spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
While she has not taken a position for or against increased collaboration with ICE, in an interview with Fox 8 in December, Hutson noted that the jail’s resources were far too stretched to take on immigration enforcement.
“I’m a lawyer. I believe in following the law and court orders and we do that and so that’s what we’re gonna do, continue to follow the law, but I cannot do ICE’s work,” she said. “It’s too big of a load.”
Potential conflict
The sheriff’s policy stems from a 2013 federal court settlement in a civil rights case involving two New Orleans construction workers picked up on minor charges in 2009 and 2010.
Mario Cacho and Antonio Ocampo sued after they were allegedly illegally held in the city’s jail past the completion of their sentences. The two were held at the request of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency issues such “detainer” requests to local law enforcement agencies, asking them to hold onto arrestees who are suspected of immigration violations.
Local agencies are only supposed to honor the hold requests for 48 hours, after which they should let detainees free. But in 2009 and 2010, then-Sheriff Marlin Gusman detained Cacho and Ocampo for months, according to legal filings in their case against the office.
Ocampo and Cacho settled the case with the Sheriff’s Office in 2013, and Gusman agreed to adopt a new policy on immigration investigations. The resulting policy blocks the agency from investigating immigration violations and from detaining immigrants for ICE without a court order, except in certain cases where they are facing charges for a small number of serious violent crimes.
Attorneys for Cacho and Ocampo declined to speak with Verite News on the record. However, filings they submitted to the court last week opposing the state’s intervention in the case argue  that Murrill has “blatantly misrepresented the OPSO policy” by falsely claiming it forces the Sheriff’s Office to disregard all ICE detainers.
The sheriff’s office, like the NOPD, has been under a sweeping federal consent decree for more than a decade. But unlike the NOPD, the jail’s consent decree does not demand that deputies stay away from federal immigration enforcement, only that it release anyone subject to an immigration hold after two days. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, which is a party to both consent decrees, has not entered any filings since Murrill moved to bring the state into the Cacho and Ocampo case.
The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.
The OPSO policy remained in place for more than a decade without any controversy until last spring, when the Louisiana Legislature passed a bill — Act 314 — that blocks so-called “sanctuary” policies prohibiting state and local law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration agencies like ICE.
A sheriff’s office spokesperson spokesperson said the agency’s policy on ICE detainers is “governed” by the consent judgement in the case. She declined to comment further, as the state is currently challenging the policy, but affirmed that OPSO is “in full compliance with all applicable state laws and valid court orders related to ICE detainers.”

OKLAHOMA CITY — On the 30th anniversary of the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history, former President Bill Clinton said Americans must unite despite their differences, and that Oklahomans can help lead the way by serving as that role model for the rest of the nation.
Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.
Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The federal building housed agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — On the 30th anniversary of the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history, former President Bill Clinton said Americans must unite despite their differences, and that Oklahomans can help lead the way by serving as that role model for the rest of the nation.
Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.

Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s Congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The Federal Building housed federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.
Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.

Where are the 92 percent?
That has been a persistent question since the presidential election, referring to the Black women who overwhelmingly organized and voted for Kamala Harris and then seemingly went dark after November 5. For many of them — who have largely rejected Donald Trump in his three campaigns for president — Harris’ loss felt like a betrayal, and another signal of disrespect from a democracy they have long worked hard to shape.
In the early days of the Trump administration, there have been feelings of anger, resolve, resignation and exhaustion among Black women and many other Americans frustrated with the president’s actions and the current political climate. Earlier this month, millions of protesters took to the streets in cities across the country to make their voices heard as Trump and ally Elon Musk have sought to dramatically remake the federal government, with consequences for real Americans.
The crowds were overwhelmingly White, not the typical makeup of other recent protest movements. Many of the Black women who have been among the leaders of such movements in the past decade, were noticeably — and intentionally — absent.
The Black women I talk to said they are being strategic, pragmatic and creative about what their resistance looks like now, preparing for a long fight ahead, and rejecting narratives that suggest their lack of visibility in this moment translates into inaction.
“People are paying more attention to what Black women are doing because of the impact we had in the election,” said Janai Nelson, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. “We pointed people in the right direction and they did not follow. We may be out of sight to some people, but we’re not checked out by any stretch. The crisis in America is certainly not out of our minds.”

Within weeks of the election, a meme began to circulate of a group of Black women sitting on the roof of a building, sipping their beverages and watching the country burn. The message: Black women would do nothing to help if the democracy they’d tried to save went up in flames.
This month, another image quickly gained traction during the “Hands Off” protests: a photograph of White marchers filing past a restaurant while Black people having brunch looked on, unbothered.
While the idea that Black women deserve rest is showing up in organic social media content, it’s also part of a campaign of misinformation, said Esosa Osa, founder of Onyx Impact, a nonprofit dedicated to researching Black online communities and fighting harmful information that targets Black voters. Emphasizing Black women talking about rest can discourage others in this key Democratic voting bloc from engaging civically.
“We are seeing bad actors trying to influence and suppress Black engagement in a really targeted and hostile way,” Osa said. “We should be cautious of any narrative that’s just, ‘Black women won’t turn out or won’t engage civically.’  Those are the types of narratives that folks working against Black power would want to uplift and amplify. Just because you don’t see your Black friend at a protest doesn’t mean we’re not working or being strategic.”
A lot of that strategy is happening behind the scenes, said Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term “intersectionality” and is a leading legal and civil rights scholar at UCLA and Columbia Law School. Crenshaw added that she has been skeptical of much of what she has seen online about Black women “resting.”
“I see a contrast between what’s being given to me on social media and what I’m seeing in the trenches,” Crenshaw said. “Are we tired? Yes. Are we heartbroken? Absolutely. Are we willing to roll over and let this … happen to us without hearing from us? I’m not seeing that, not in the circles I talk to. We don’t have an option not to fight.”

Nelson is among the Black women in the fight now, tapping into LDF’s long history of legal activism to make American democracy live up to its values. The group was among several civil rights organizations that filed a lawsuit earlier this month challenging Trump’s executive order calling for sweeping election changes.
Fatima Goss Graves, head of the National Women’s Law Center, said Black women are leading a lot of the strategy in this time, pointing to colleagues like Alexis McGill Johnson of Planned Parenthood; Melanie Campbell of the Black Women’s Roundtable, a network focused on the political and economic power of Black women; and SEIU President April Verrett. In February, Graves’ organization, a nonprofit advancing gender justice, filed a lawsuit challenging the president’s executive orders that take aim at diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
Asked about this month’s protests, Graves said she was not surprised to see White Americans — who make up the majority of the federal workforce — as the main participants.
“The folks who usually come to the streets first are the ones who see the direct impact,” Graves pointed out. “You haven’t always seen groups like that in the streets. I actually feel good about Black women’s leadership at this time. They understand the assignment fully.”
And there are others, focused on building community, messaging to counteract negative narratives and protesting with the power of their purses.

In the days leading up to Trump’s joint address to Congress, an idea was launched by Black activists, organizers and strategists including Angela Rye, Leah Daughtry and Tamika Mallory to provide an alternative to the president’s speech: a marathon of online programming aimed at educating and empowering Black Americans impacted by the new administration.
“State of the People” streamed for 24 hours and has since evolved into a 10-city tour starting April 26 in Atlanta that will include mutual aid, political education and town halls.
“We have not stopped; we are focused on not just surviving, but making sure we don’t lose ground on what we have achieved as a people in this country,” said Campbell, one of the organizers of the State of the People effort. “This is designed to build a larger, intergenerational movement, showing the potential of long-term, sustained organizing on the ground and online.”
During the Lenten season, Jamal Bryant, pastor of the Atlanta-based mega congregation New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, called for a 40-day boycott of Target after the retailer announced it would scale back its DEI initiatives. The campaign came in the wake of the Trump administration’s executive orders calling for an end to such programs, which the president referred to as “radical and wasteful.” Black consumers, many of them women, make up nearly 9 percent of Target shoppers. While the full impact of the boycott is unclear, the company’s stock price has dropped, foot traffic to stores has slowed significantly and net quarterly sales decreased as a result.
Last month, 100 women did a “buy-in” at a Washington, D.C.-area Costco to show support for the store’s commitment to DEI as part of an annual summit organized by the Black Women’s Roundtable. Campbell said the gathering also included a day on Capitol Hill hosted by Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blount Rochester — the nation’s two Black women senators — focused on federal budget priorities including Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.
Campbell said she has been part of different organizing efforts since the election and strategizing around protecting Black women’s leadership in this moment.
“Part of resistance is self-care,” Campbell said. “That does not have anything to do with not fighting, because we are. We said we were going to take some rest after November 5, but there was never any notion that we weren’t going to fight for our freedom in this country.”

Resistance to the Trump administration, including for Black women, is still taking shape. Campbell said she invites allies whom she felt left down by after the election to step up now. What is clear in this unprecedented moment is that it will not look like it has looked before.
Nelson said Black women’s roles now must be “very targeted, very pinpointed, because we are in a crisis unlike anything we have seen in modern history for Black women.”
“We’re taking it very seriously,” Nelson said. “To the extent people sense silence or reserve, those energies are being put to good use, just in a quiet way.”
When the moment is right, Graves predicted that Black women could also take their protest to the streets.
“That’s part of being a strategist,” she said. “We’ll know when it’s time for us to engage, and that’s OK.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-15-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-20 11:07:07.320676

(Photo by Maddie McGarvey for KFF Health News)For many years, Eric Wunderlin’s health issues made it hard to find stable employment.
Struggling to manage depression and diabetes, Wunderlin worked part-time, minimum-wage retail jobs around Dayton, Ohio, making so little he said he sometimes had to choose between paying rent and buying food.
But in 2018, his CareSource Medicaid health plan offered him help getting a job. It connected him to a life coach, who helped him find full-time work with health benefits. Now, he works for a nonprofit social service agency, a job he said has given him enough financial stability to plan a European vacation next year.
“I feel like a real person and I can go do things,” said Wunderlin, 42. “I feel like I pulled myself out of that slump.”
Republicans in Congress and several states, including Ohio, Iowa, and Montana, are pushing to implement work requirements for nondisabled adults, arguing a mandate would encourage enrollees to find jobs. And for Republicans pushing to require Medicaid enrollees to work, Wunderlin’s story could be held up as evidence that government health coverage can help people find employment and, ultimately, reduce their need for public assistance.
Yet his experience is rare. Medicaid typically does not offer such help, and when states do try to help, such efforts are limited.
And opponents point out that most Medicaid recipients already have jobs and say such a mandate would only kick eligible people off Medicaid, rather than improve their economic prospects. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, with most of the rest acting as caregivers, going to school, or unable to hold a job due to disability or illness, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Existing efforts to help Medicaid recipients get a job have seen limited success because there’s not a lot of “room to move the needle,” said Ben Sommers, a professor of health care economics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Most Medicaid enrollees already work — just not in jobs with health benefits, he said.
“The ongoing argument that some folks make is that there are a lot of people freeloading in Medicaid,” he said. “That’s just not supported by the evidence.”

Using health programs to encourage work
The GOP-controlled Congress could allow or require states to implement a Medicaid work requirement as part of revamping and downsizing Medicaid. The first Trump administration encouraged those work mandates, but many were struck down by federal judges who said they were illegal under federal law.
Policy experts and state officials say more attention should be paid to investments that have helped people find better jobs — from personalized life coaching to, in some cases, health plans’ directly hiring enrollees.
They argue work requirements alone are not enough. “The move to economic mobility requires a ladder, not a stick,” said Farah Khan, a fellow with the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.
While Medicaid work requirements have been debated for decades, the issue has become more heated as 40 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act to the vast majority of low-income adults. More than 20 million adults have gained coverage as a result — but Republicans are now considering eliminating the billions in extra federal funding that helped states extend eligibility beyond groups including many children, pregnant women, and disabled people.
Only Georgia and Arkansas have implemented mandates that some Medicaid enrollees work, volunteer, go to school, or enroll in job training. But a study Sommers co-authored showed no evidence work requirements in Arkansas’ program led to more people working, in part because most of those who could work already were.
In Arkansas, more than 18,000 people lost coverage under the state’s requirement before the policy was suspended by a federal judge in 2019 after less than a year. Those who lost their Medicaid health care reported being unaware or confused about how to report work hours. Since 2023, Arkansas has been giving Medicaid health plans financial incentives to help enrollees train for jobs, but so far few have taken advantage.
Some plans, including Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield’s, offer members $25 to $65 to complete a “career readiness” certificate. In 2024, some Arkansas health plans offered enrollees educational videos about topics including taxes and cryptocurrency.
Health plans don’t have an incentive to help someone find a better-paying job, because that could mean losing a customer if they then make too much to qualify for Medicaid, said Karin VanZant, a vice president at Clearlink Partners, a health care consulting company.
Rather than offering incentives for providing job training, some states, such as California and Ohio, require the insurance companies that run Medicaid to help enrollees find work.
In Montana, where some lawmakers are pushing to implement work requirements, a promising optional program nearly collapsed after state lawmakers required it be outsourced to private contractors.
Within the program’s first three years, the state paired 32,000 Medicaid enrollees with existing federally funded job training programs. Most had higher wages a year after starting training, the state found.
But enrollment has plummeted to just 11 people, according to the latest data provided by the state’s labor department.
Sarah Swanson, who heads the department, said several of the nonprofit contractors that ran the program shuttered. “There was no real part in this for us to deliver direct services to the folks that walked through our door,” she said. The state hopes to revive job training by allowing the department to work alongside contractors to reach more people.
The hunt for results
State officials say they don’t have much data to track the effectiveness of existing job programs offered by Medicaid plans.
Stephanie O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, said the state does not track outcomes because “the health plans are not employment agencies.”
Officials with CareSource, which operates Medicaid plans in multiple states, say it has about 2,300 Medicaid and ACA marketplace enrollees in its JobConnect program — about 1,400 in Ohio, 500 in Georgia, and 400 in Indiana.
The program connects job seekers with a life coach who counsels them on skills such as “showing up on time, dressing the part for interviews, and selling yourself during the interview,” said Jesse Reed, CareSource’s director of life services in Ohio.
 
Since 2023, about 800 people have found jobs through the program, according to Josh Boynton, a senior vice president at CareSource. The health plan itself has hired 29 Medicaid enrollees into customer service, pharmacy, and other positions — nearly all full-time with benefits, he said.
In 2022, California started offering nontraditional health benefits through Medicaid — including help finding jobs — for enrollees experiencing homelessness or serious mental illness, or who are otherwise at risk of avoidable emergency room care. As of September, it had served nearly 280,000 enrollees, but the state doesn’t have data on how many became employed.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which is among the largest private employers in Pennsylvania, running both a sprawling hospital system and a Medicaid plan, has hired over 10,000 of its Medicaid enrollees since 2021 through its training and support services. Among other jobs, they took positions as warehouse workers, customer service representatives, and medical assistants.
The vast majority left low-paying jobs for full-time positions with health benefits, said Dan LaVallee, a senior director of UPMC Health Plan’s Center for Social Impact. “Our Pathways to Work program is a model for the nation,” he said.
Josh Archambault, a senior fellow with the conservative Cicero Institute, said Medicaid should focus on improving the financial health of those enrolled.
While the first Trump administration approved Medicaid work requirements in 13 states, the Biden administration or federal judges blocked all except Georgia’s.
“I don’t think states have been given ample chance to experiment and try to figure out what works,” Archambault said.

Photo by Erick Diaz VelizOn the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, which kicked off the American Revolution, hundreds of Michiganders gathered outside the Michigan State Capitol Saturday to protest against the Trump administration and its actions, especially as they pertained to immigration. They also marched along the sidewalks surrounding the Capitol, joining protests taking place in cities across the country.
The sound of church bells around downtown Lansing coincided with the start of the rally organized by Stand Against Extremism, or  SAGE, and promoted on social media, highlighting their call for freedom, equality, and justice, and their solidarity with nationwide protests organized by grassroots protest group 50501. 
Protests were also held across Michigan, including in Coldwater, Detroit, Flint, Grand Rapids, Livonia, Port Huron, and Portage.
As the first speakers took their positions at the entrance to the Capitol, hundreds more people approached the Capitol grounds with anti-Trump, anti-authoritarianism, and anti-Nazi signs and banners.
“This is the anniversary of the beginning of the American Revolution, and the democratic rights that were established during that revolution, and later confirmed and developed in the American Civil War, are now under attack,” said Tim Rivers, 65, a member of the socialist movement, during his speech.
“Hundreds have already been sent [to the El Salvodoran prison known as CECOT], and now Trump is threatening to take American citizens and deport them to El Salvador,” Rivers added.

On April 17, Juan Carlos López-Gómez, 20, was released after being arrested in Florida by federal immigration agents, despite being a natural-born American citizen. However, Lopez-Gomez was not the only U.S citizen who had an encounter with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Ramiro Martinez, a Mexican immigrant and U.S. citizen, was surrounded and detained by ICE in Michigan earlier this month.
Additionally, concerns about border patrol agents’ actions under Trump’s policies have been fueled by emails sent on April 11, around the country, by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to immigrants who entered the country using CBP One, a mobile app developed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with an American citizen in Michigan also receiving those messages.
Around 12:30, the march began on W. Allegan Street and marched once around the Capitol, as protesters chanted against the current administration.

“The purpose of our march was basically to defend our democracy. We wanted people to come out and express their discomfort with what is going on a national scale,” said Daniel Pfau, 37, a volunteer with SAGE. “I hope that people see this event is by the people, for the people. We didn’t need a national organization in charge. We showed up, and we took care.”
After the march, a series of speakers took the microphone to express their concerns to the audience. Among the speakers were community members, social activists, and elected officials who primarily spoke out against the federal government’s targeting of immigrants across the country.
“They are trying to distract us. They want people divided. They want to bring out the worst impulses in many people’s hearts,” said State Rep. Jasper Martus (D-Flushing) during his speech. “We need to think about all those folks who are going to church tomorrow morning and saying they’re okay with deporting people who are here illegally. I’m a believer, but that’s not what I believe in.”
During the speeches, support was given for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident the Trump administration erroneously deported to his native El Salvador, which was echoed and chanted by the audience in favor of his release and return to the US.
Abrego Garcia was arrested March 12 as he drove his 5-year-old son home, and was informed by ICE agents that his status had changed, despite an order that determined it was more “likely than not that he would be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador” if he were returned there, according to court documents.
Although ICE accepted his deportation was due to an administrative error, and the Supreme Court of the United States later ordered his return, on April 14, U.S. President Trump and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele announced in the Oval Office that they would not release Abrego Garcia.
Toward the end of the demonstration, near the Capitol, on the side of North Capitol Avenue, a Trump supporter counter-protested, giving speeches and holding a sign that read “God, put Trump in.” This situation generated tense moments among the protesters, who approached to confront and argue with the lone counter-protestor. 
By the end of the day, no acts of violence or physical confrontations had been reported.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The Trump administration proposed a new rule Wednesday that would rescind widespread habitat protections for species protected under the Endangered Species Act, a landmark law enacted in 1973 to conserve the country’s imperiled animals and plants.
That would open the door for developments across the country to be approved even if they significantly disrupt critical habitat for species listed under the Endangered Species Act. The proposed rule, posted in the U.S. Federal Register by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service, would “rescind the regulatory definition of ‘harm,’” which is defined as any significant habitat modification or degradation that actually kills or injures wildlife.
Environmental groups lambasted the proposal.
“There’s just no way to protect animals and plants from extinction without protecting the places they live, yet the Trump administration is opening the floodgates to immeasurable habitat destruction,” said Noah Greenwald, co-director of endangered species at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This administration’s greed and contempt for imperiled wildlife know no bounds, but most Americans know that we destroy the natural world at our own peril. Nobody voted to drive spotted owls, Florida panthers or grizzly bears to extinction.”
If approved, he said, the rule would mean endangered species would only be protected from actions that intentionally lead to the harm of a species. “It’s just foundational to how we’ve protected endangered species for the last 40-plus years, and they’re just completely upending that,” Greenwald said.










This administration’s greed and contempt for imperiled wildlife know no bounds.


–  Noah Greenwald, Center for Biological Diversity


Just the day before Wednesday’s proposed rule, the Trump administration put out a rescission notice to roll back a rule that put conservation on equal footing with extractive uses on the nation’s public lands. The two decisions, along with scores of others in recent months since President Trump took office, threaten species and the habitats they depend on across the country, experts and environmentalists say.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond to a request for comment.
 What does ‘harm’ mean? 

By law, the ESA prohibits the “take” of an endangered species, which includes actions “to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.” Historically, the “harm” part of this mandate encompasses “any activity that can modify a species’ habitat.”
This interpretation of “harm” has long been used by agencies to extend protections for endangered species to the land or ocean area that it relies on. For example, an oil or gas project may not be able to drill or be forced to modify operations in a certain area that provides habitat for an endangered animal, such as a dune sagebrush lizard. In many cases, the “harm” rule has not blocked projects altogether, but rather resulted in different designs that reduce impacts on endangered species.
In 1995, a group of landowners and timber interests in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast challenged the regulation’s interpretation in a push to log forests where endangered northern spotted owls and red-cockaded woodpeckers lived. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upheld the broad definition of “harm” on the basis of the Chevron Doctrine, a principle that defers to federal agencies’ expertise for carrying out laws. Last year, however, Chevron was overturned, and the Trump administration has seized on that in the new proposed rule.
The new proposal would eliminate this “harm” definition—and the habitat protections that come with it, according to Dave Owen, an environmental law professor at the University of California, San Francisco.
“The shift here would be to say that just habitat modification that is detrimental to a species, even if the detriment is fairly direct, is not encompassed within the word ‘harm,’” Owen said. The majority of habitat protections related to the ESA fall under the “harm” interpretation, according to a 2012 study by Owen. Now, under the proposal, “the word ‘harm’ is essentially going to be read as an inconsequential nullity,” he said.
The Trump administration says that its proposal is more in line with the language in the ESA, arguing that the regulations surrounding the word “harm” should be defined as an “affirmative act directed immediately against a particular animal,” rather than one that could indirectly harm an endangered species’ population, according to the posting of the proposed rule in the Federal Register. However, research shows that habitat loss is a primary driver of extinction in the United States.
In the case of the spotted owl, nests must have a 70-acre circle of land around them protected, even on private lands used for timber. “With this change, they don’t have to do that anymore,” said Greenwald with the Center for Biological Diversity.
The Trump administration’s proposal is the latest in a series of deregulatory moves to undermine the ESA, which Republicans have long attacked for stifling economic development and interfering with states’ ability to manage wildlife. Rolling back its ability to protect species was outlined in Project 2025, the conservative roadmap published before the 2024 elections guiding much of the administration’s actions.
On Inauguration Day, President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency,” which outlined a process to enable fossil fuel projects to bypass the typical environmental reviews associated with approval, including those required by the Endangered Species Act. The order directed the heads of all agencies and the secretary of the Army to identify projects “that may be subject to emergency treatment” within 30 days. By mid-February, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers marked for review more than 600 permit applications for energy-related projects that could qualify for the fast-pass treatment, though environmental groups argue these efforts would disrupt crucial wetlands.
To support efforts for “unleashing energy dominance,” the secretary of the Department of Interior, Doug Burgum, issued several orders in February that aim to “suspend, revise, or rescind” several ESA regulations enacted during the Biden administration. This new proposal to rescind the harm definition could also pave the way for new energy projects, experts say.
The historic interpretation of the regulation served “as sort of a caution to people not to go down and knock down trees where red-cockaded woodpeckers were nesting. And if you change the definition, I think there’s the risk that people are going to go out and engage in that behavior in the real world,” said Andrew Mergen, the director of Harvard Law School’s Emmett Environmental Law and Policy Clinic. “The rule plays a really important role in preventing people from doing that sort of thing, and at the same time, it has hardly damaged the economy, or made economic progress impossible.”
The public will have 30 days to submit comments on the proposal. Environmental groups like Earthjustice have vowed to challenge the rule in court.
 A series of attacks on conservation

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the administration proposed rescinding the Public Lands Rule—a landmark achievement of the Biden administration that placed conservation on equal footing as extraction across the nation’s public lands following an extensive public comment period. Ninety  percent of comments received supported the rule. Another rule implemented last year that restricts oil and gas development across millions of acres of public lands in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was also rescinded.
“This is not policy—it’s a blatant giveaway to industry that threatens to dismantle decades of conservation progress, shut down public access, harm wildlife and accelerate the reckless sell-off of our natural resources,” said Alison Flint, senior legal director at The Wilderness Society, in a statement concerning the two proposed rescission notices.
Already this year, a series of executive orders and actions by Trump have removed protections across millions of acres in national forests to boost the logging industry, streamlined the permitting process for mines, made the extraction of minerals on public lands with suitable resources the priority use, and targeted national monuments elimination. Staff at national parks have also been gutted.
All of this has come despite polling showing that conserving public lands is universally popular across party lines.
“The Trump administration is just working to undermine all protections for air, for water, for wildlife and climate—systematically and rapidly,” Greenwald said.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)MANSFIELD — When DeSoto Regional Health System took out $36 million in loans last year to renovate a rural hospital that opened in 1952, officials were banking on its main funding source remaining stable: Medicaid, the joint federal-state health program for low-income people and the disabled.
But those dollars are now in jeopardy, as President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress move to shrink the nearly $900 billion health program that covers more than 1 in 5 Americans.
DeSoto CEO Todd Eppler said Medicaid cuts could make it harder for his hospital to repay the loans and for patients to access care.
“I just hope that the people who are making these decisions have thought deeply about it and have some context of the real-world implications,” he said, “because it’s going to affect us as a hospital and going to affect our patients.”

One of the decision-makers is Eppler’s representative in Congress: House Speaker Mike Johnson, who lives about 35 miles north of here. He said he knows the Republican leader and his staff understand hospitals’ plight: The mother of Johnson’s chief of staff is CEO of a rural hospital in the district.
“I’ve never met a congressman yet that wanted a rural hospital in their district to close, and certainly Mike is no exception to that rule,” Eppler said.
Last year nearly 290,000 people in Johnson’s district were enrolled in Medicaid, about 38% of the total population, according to data compiled by KFF, the health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
About 118,000 of them are in the program thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which allowed states including Louisiana to expand Medicaid to cover low-income adults, many of whom were working in low-paying jobs that don’t provide health insurance.
Louisiana ranks second in Medicaid enrollment, at nearly 32% — a reflection of the state’s high poverty rate. As Republicans weigh cuts, their actions could have dramatic consequences for their constituents here. Of the eight GOP-held House districts with the most Medicaid enrollees due to the expansion, four are in Louisiana. Johnson’s largely rural district ranks sixth in expansion enrollees.
Among them is Chloe Stovall, 23, who works in the produce aisle at the SuperValu grocery store in Vivian. She said her take-home wage working full time is $200 a week. She doesn’t own a car and walks a mile to work.
The store provides health coverage, but she said she won’t qualify until she’s worked there for a full year — and even then, it will cost more than Medicaid, which is free.
“I’m just barely surviving,” she said.
In February, Johnson pushed a budget resolution through the House that calls for cutting at least $880 billion over a decade from a pool of funding that includes Medicaid, to help fund an extension of Trump’s tax cuts and his border priorities. Republicans in Congress are now considering where to make cuts, and Medicaid is likely to take a big hit.
Defending the plan, Johnson said that Medicaid is “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Stovall said almost everyone she knows on Medicaid works at least one job. “I don’t even own a TV,” she said.
Contacted for comment, Johnson’s office pointed to his remarks at a conference in Washington last month. “We’re going to be very careful not to cut a benefit for anyone who is eligible to receive it and relies upon it,” Johnson said.

KFF Health News spoke with two dozen Medicaid enrollees in Johnson’s district. Most said they were unaware their congressman is leading the Republican charge to upend the program. Those informed of the Republican plan said it scares them.
Some GOP members of Congress want to eliminate the ACA’s Medicaid expansion funding, which led to 20 million working-age adults gaining coverage and helped slash the nation’s uninsured rate to its lowest level in history. Forty states and the District of Columbia have agreed to the change, which promised extra federal funding in exchange for expanding eligibility.
In this heavily Republican district, where Johnson won with 86% of the vote in November, 22% of residents live in poverty.
Like Trump, Johnson says he wants cuts to Medicaid but hasn’t elaborated other than saying the program should not cover “able-bodied” adults without imposing a work requirement.
“Everybody is committed” to preserving Medicaid benefits “for those who desperately need it and deserve it and qualify for it,” Johnson said at a news conference in February. “What we’re talking about is rooting out the fraud, waste, and abuse.”
Medicaid recipients in Johnson’s district, told about GOP plans to cut the program, said their lives are hard enough in a state where the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Without Medicaid, they said, they couldn’t afford health coverage.
In Vivian, near the borders with Arkansas and Texas, close to half of the 2,900 residents live in poverty. The main-street shops are mostly shuttered, except for a thrift store and a mom-and-pop restaurant that specializes in fried pork chops.
“Most everybody you know is on Medicaid here,” said Doris Luccous, 24.
Luccous said she makes $250 a week after taxes as a housekeeper at a nursing home while raising her 2-year-old daughter in her childhood home. While shopping with her father — who doesn’t work, because of a disability — she said she counts on Medicaid for her bipolar medicines and to pay for therapy appointments.
“I don’t know where I would be without it,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Neither Luccous nor Stovall said they voted in the last election, and neither knew that Johnson is their representative in Congress.
Vivian has few large employers, and most employers pay the minimum wage, which hasn’t changed since 2009. “We are just stuck,” Stovall said.
Still, she said, “it’s a community where everybody knows everybody, and people are always willing to lend a hand because so many are in difficult financial circumstances.”
Willie White is CEO of David Raines Community Health Centers, which operates six outpatient clinics in northwestern Louisiana that serve primarily Medicaid enrollees. He said that Louisiana already ranks among the worst states for people’s health and that Medicaid cuts would only worsen the situation.
“You cannot expect health outcomes to improve if people can’t afford to access care,” White said.
While the clinics provide primary and dental care on a sliding fee scale for uninsured patients, signing them up for Medicaid gives them better access to specialists and brings the health centers revenue to cover the cost of delivering care.

Many of the centers’ patients gained coverage through Medicaid expansion. Afterward, rates of screenings for colon and cervical cancer went from 10% to 50%, White said.
But if Congress cuts Medicaid, the health centers would be forced to cut services, he said.
“Mike Johnson has been here and knows us, and he and his office have been responsive about our issues,” White said. “The message in prior years was, ‘We need additional funding,’ but now it is asking for no cuts.”
Community health centers, which in 2023 provided care nationally to more than 32 million mostly low-income people, have seen funding increases from Republicans and Democrats for decades.
“Everyone is supportive, but the question remains what that support will look like under the current administration,” White said. “If there are to be reductions, they need to be done with a scalpel.”
Expecting cuts, the health centers have already restricted travel and put a hold on filling vacant positions, White said.
Sitting in a David Raines clinic in Bossier City, Benjamin Andrade, 57, said having Medicaid has been a lifesaver since he needed heart surgery in 2020. Andrade is a chef and said he supports his wife and two children on $14 an hour.
He had not heard about any potential cuts to the program. Without Medicaid, he said, “it would be very hard for me to pay for all the medicines I take.”
Dominique Youngblood, 31, who was at the clinic for a dental checkup, said she’s had Medicaid most of her life. “Medicaid helps me so I don’t have to pay out-of-pocket going to the doctors,” she said.
Youngblood, who has two children, makes $12 an hour at a day care center. Asked about GOP efforts to scale back the program, she said, “It’s not fair, because it helps a lot of people who cannot afford medications and emergency room trips, and those are costs you can’t control.”

Back in Mansfield, Eppler’s hospital is more than just a health facility — it’s where many people in town come for lunch. The cafeteria was packed on a recent Friday as workers served boiled shrimp, fried okra, and baked fish.
Eppler said he’s aware Republicans in Congress are targeting a system of taxes that some states, including Louisiana, levy on hospitals and other health providers to draw down more federal Medicaid funding. That money helps finance what are known as supplemental payments to providers. Some conservatives belittle the extra funding as “money laundering.”
But that money accounts for about 15% of the DeSoto health system’s budget, said Eppler, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who has been CEO for a dozen years. “We are using that money to invest in the next 50 years of Desoto Parish, to build a hospital that they can have that will be sustainable,” he said.
The supplemental payments, for example, help pay to provide mental health services at three outpatient clinics. “If that $4 million went away, we would have to limit services — it’s just that simple,” he said.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Opponents are turning to legal challenges to try to block or delay major public transit expansions — even after voters approve them.
Recent lawsuits in Arizona, Tennessee and Texas have attempted to slow voter-passed projects.
In Nashville, Tennessee, voters passed a $3.1 billion referendum in November to raise the city sales tax half a cent and fund expanded bus service, pedestrian improvements and 54 miles of “all-access” transit corridors. But a Tennessee court, while upholding most of the project, ruled last week that the city could not use the funds raised to purchase land for affordable housing or parks.
The ruling affects only 1% of the total revenue, the court said. But it was a signal that even well-funded, voter-backed transit efforts are vulnerable to some legal roadblocks.
After voters in Maricopa County, Arizona, last year approved an extension of a half-cent sales tax for transportation, the county GOP sued to try to invalidate the results, arguing the vote didn’t meet a 60% supermajority.
In Austin, Texas, a 2024 class-action lawsuit attempted to block the city from collecting property taxes unless it excludes a tax approved by voters in 2020 to fund Project Connect — a major transit expansion. But a judge dismissed the lawsuit late last year.
Public support for expanded transit is surging across the United States. In 2024 alone, voters approved 46 of 53 transit-related ballot measures, unlocking over $25 billion in new funding for transit projects and improvements, according to the American Public Transportation Association.
But despite support at the ballot box, cities often face legal, zoning and political barriers.
Nashville, in particular, is becoming a case study in both momentum and resistance to transit investment and development, according to researchers at the Urban Institute.
“There’s been a sea change,” said Gabe Samuels, a research analyst in the Housing and Communities Division at the Urban Institute. “Nashville had two failed transit referenda in the past decade. This time, it passed decisively. Voters want alternatives to sprawl and traffic.”
But transit-oriented development — the strategy of clustering housing and businesses near high-quality transit — is often hindered by outdated zoning, Samuels and colleague Yonah Freemark told Stateline.
According to an Urban Institute study, more than 90% of Nashville’s residential land is zoned for single- or two-family homes, a pattern common in Southern and Midwestern cities. That zoning limits the density needed to support high transit ridership, the report said. Currently, only 13% of Nashville’s housing lies within a quarter-mile, what the report calls easy walking distance, of its planned transit corridors.
“You’re investing millions — sometimes billions — into transit systems,” said Freemark. “If you’re not thinking about land use and density alongside that, you’re wasting the opportunity.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-20 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Chris Murphy, a new ‘pugilistic populist,’ maps resistance to Trump",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/20/chris-murphy-trump-pugilistic-populism/,Chris Murphy says President Trump is bullying key institutions into submission. He wants to meet the moment with uncompromising defiance.,"Sen. Chris Murphy was dropped at the L Street entrance of Washington, D.C.’s convention center and hustled through the kitchen to a ballroom where 2,000 progressive activists waited to hear his thoughts on what to do about the 47th president of the United States and the sorry state of the Democratic Party.
The audience was midway through a weeklong, largely off-the-record summit of “America Votes,” the self-described “coordination hub of the progressive community.” It promised “experts, strategists, and renowned progressive leaders to begin writing the next chapter of the American story.”
Among them was Murphy, 51, the Democratic junior senator from Connecticut. Reelected in November to a third term, Murphy is in his third new phase as a senator — the first 10 years building a gun control movement, the last two as a broker of bipartisan deals on gun safety and border control.
“And now I’m trying to convince my party to meet the moment and bash these guys over the head with a baseball bat, metaphorically,” Murphy said.
The moment, as Murphy describes it in increasingly heated terms in person and online, is a campaign by President Donald J. Trump and Elon Musk to undermine the press and bully law firms, universities and business leaders into submission, and the only way it can be met is with uncompromising, if risky, defiance.
“Our democracy isn’t at risk of dying. It is dying as we speak. We are watching it die. It is not too late to save it,” Murphy said in a Senate speech on April 10. “We say that again, it is not too late to save our democracy, but we can’t continue to close our eyes and think that our democracy can survive a coordinated assault on those four key institutions of accountability.”
Murphy is a multiplatform messenger, a believer in repetition. On Thursday night, unshaven and casually dressed after a basketball game with the youngest of his two teenage sons, he delivered a live video briefing on Instagram that repurposed and updated the Senate speech.
“So, I want to go over events that have been developing really, really fast. Trump’s plan is real. He has a plan,” said Murphy, who has 200,000 followers on Instagram and one million on X. “He is implementing it to convert our democracy to some form of autocracy, and that’s the only way that you can get away with the corruption and the thievery.”

Online, where his Instagram remarks got more than 12,000 “likes” by Saturday morning, or the previous week while addressing a live audience in the convention center ballroom, Murphy preaches and teaches the gospel of resistance, rallies and “mass mobilizations” as the counter to Trump’s efforts to quell dissent.
“They’re playing a different game, and whether we like it or not, we have to choose to fight on the terms that they’re setting,” Murphy told the activists. It is time, he said, for Democrats “to take big swings” on both tactics and policies. The message from Murphy is not new, but similar calls are popping up in unexpected places, such as buttoned-down David Brooks calling for an “uprising” on the New York Times opinion page.
As Murphy told the activists, he would have preferred that Democrats boycotted the president’s speech to a joint session of Congress, as he did.
“He has an obligation to give a real State of the Union speech, not run a reality show, not stand up on stage and tell lie after lie after lie,” Murphy said. “He’s not willing to play that on the level. Why are we willing to play that, right?”
Murphy voted to confirm Marco Rubio as secretary of state, but says there will be no more gestures of cooperation, of recognizing institutional norms. If they are a Trump nominee, they are complicit and to be opposed. He wished his Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, had not voted with Republicans for a budget resolution drafted with no Democratic input. Let the government shut down. Let them own it.
Yes, Murphy said, it would have carried a risk.
“For ordinary Americans to take risks, or, for instance, for law firms or universities to take risks and just say no to this guy when he tries to extort them, then political leaders need to be willing to take risks as well. Right?”  Murphy said.
It was an applause line.

Fundraising like Bernie
Murphy entered the ballroom knowing that a campaign finance filing soon would show that his relentless, blunt and occasionally profane critiques of the Republican president and Democratic Party was putting him in a league with Bernie Sanders in the online game of raising money off opposition to Trump.
The report filed Wednesday shows Murphy spent $3.4 million in the first three months of 2025 on online pitches for help supporting “a political opposition movement” that remains a work in progress, so far producing a single town-hall meeting in Warren, Mich., and the promise of two more this week in North Carolina and Missouri. 
The online appeals, buttressed with constant presence on social media platforms and cable television, plus featured turns with everyone from the New Yorker’s David Remnick to the comedian podcaster Hasan Minhaj, brought in an eye-popping $8 million.
“It’s obviously an uncommon amount of money,” Murphy said. “I mean, it was shocking to me. It was shocking to me that so many people were interested in contributing. And I just feel like I have an obligation to put that money on the ground right now. Even though they were contributing to my election funds, they were really contributing as a means to try to help meet the moment.”
After expenses, Murphy netted $4 million for the quarter, adding to the $5.5 million leftover from his easy reelection last year. 
OK, listen, it is scary. I’m not going to tell you it’s not scary.U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.
Among senators not facing reelection in 2026 or 2028, only Sanders raised more in the same period. The independent from Vermont and undisputed leader of the American progressive movement raised $11.4 million, while spending only $1.3 million to prime the pump with digital appeals.
The 83-year-old Sanders has been on the road since Feb. 21 with his “Fighting Oligarchy Tour,” staging 15 rallies in the midwest and west with his 35-year-old ally, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Their stops in Denver and Los Angeles each drew more than 30,000 people.
Sanders figures prominently in Murphy’s retooled messaging: Economic populism should have been the tentpole of Kamala Harris’ campaign, and elements of the Democratic Party owe Sanders an apology for dismissing the two-time presidential candidate as occupying a place on the fringe of politics.

Pugilistic populism
At the America Votes’ summit, which ended as Congress left Washington for a two-week recess on April 11, Murphy insisted the Biden administration, by reinvigorating the Federal Trade Commission and authorizing antitrust actions, had a credible record of standing up for workers and against corporations.
“But Joe Biden wasn’t out there every single day beating the hell out of the tech companies that were poisoning our kids, against the oil companies that were price-gouging us at the pumps, the retail companies that were shipping all of our jobs overseas,” Murphy said. “You have to be engaged in a daily fight with the corporations, the greedy corporations, the price gouging corporations that are screwing Americans.”
Murphy said his new populist rhetoric signifies a change in tone, not philosophy.
“While I’ve always, I think, been a populist, I’m maybe a louder populist,” Murphy said. “I’m maybe more interested in being more pugilistic in my populism.”
During an interview in his office the next day, between speaking at a tax-fairness rally in a park by the Capitol and then giving a floor speech on the mounting threats to democracy, Murphy said a pugilistic populism means naming names, not blandly promising to “fight special interests.” 
“That’s a purposefully cowardly term,” Murphy said. “But when you say, ‘I’m going to attack the way that Amazon is destroying local businesses. I’m going to stop Pfizer and Bristol-Myers from bankrupting families, I’m gonna stop big agriculture from driving up the cost of food’ and tell them how you’re gonna do it, that’s a much more believable populism.”
Stylistically, Murphy runs cooler than Sanders and AOC, who draw energy from crowds. Murphy can sound like he is giving a TED Talk, conversational and informative. On Thursday, after warning that civil disobedience might be necessary sooner than later, he paused and said, “OK, listen, it is scary. I’m not going to tell you it’s not scary.”
Murphy, who managed a congressional campaign when he was 22, always has thought like a political strategist as much as a politician. His rhetoric and fundraising have renewed speculation of presidential ambitions, but some admirers wonder if a better role model would be LBJ, the master of the Senate, not president.
“As long as you are nimble, there are a lot of ways to be continually relevant and make a difference on behalf of things that you care about,” he said, taking break in office. He had just addressed a tax fairness rally outside the Capitol and was about to deliver a speech to the Senate.
He insists his rainmaking, his road trips and his social media are not prepatory to a campaign for higher office. 
“I think part of the reason that my voice is breaking through a little bit right now is that it’s not poisoned by personal ambition,” he said. “I think the reason that I feel and sound a little bit more authentic in my worry about where the country is is because I’m genuinely seized by my worry. And I’m posting videos not to gain followers. I’m posting videos to try to change people’s minds and to try to raise people’s urgency.”
He asserted a strategic role on Nov. 10 with a series of tweets and a 4-minute video in which he delivered a calm if devastating post-mortem of why so many blue-collar Democrats either defected to Trump or didn’t show up.
“We are not listening to the people we claim to represent,” Murphy said in the video. “We claim to be the party of the working class, the party of poor people, and yet we let interest groups and think tanks tell us what those people need. That’s why we end up with these relatively small-ball solutions. Not saying they don’t matter, but more roads and bridges, bulk negotiation of prescription drug prices, little bit bigger tax credit for families with kids, that’s not meeting the moment.”

Spent last week licking wounds. Now it's time to get to work. Some thoughts on the path forward. In short, we need to rebuild the left. No band aids. Admit that our policies don't connect with people emotionally. Stop being so afraid of populist fights. Build a bigger tent. pic.twitter.com/MPNn2mAEFJ— Chris Murphy  (@ChrisMurphyCT) November 10, 2024

That video created an immediate buzz, especially among Sanders supporters who had given up on the Democratic Party, people like Mike Figueredo, the founder and host of “The Humanist Report” podcast. On a show in November, he summarized Murphy’s message as an unexpected validation of Sanders.
“Wow. I’ve got to say I am genuinely shocked to see a sitting Democratic Party senator admit this about the party,” Figueredo said. “I mean, we all know it’s true, but to see them admit it is quite the thing to behold. And of course, he’s exactly right. Democrats shun their working class base because they think that those high income supporters are going to be the ones to carry them.”
Not all of Murphy’s prescription was applauded by Figueredo or others on the left. While pushing the party to be more aggressive and risk-tolerant in fighting Trump, he is also urging it to be less judgmental as a necessary step to reestablishing Democrats as the big-tent party.

On X, Murphy wrote, “You need to let people into the tent who aren’t 100% on board with us on every social and cultural issue, or issues like guns or climate.” In his speech to the activists, Murphy noted he spent the better part of a decade making sure that support for universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons was a litmus test for Democratic presidential candidates.
“I remember patting myself on the back in 2020 when we held a big forum on gun violence in Las Vegas, Nev., and every single Democratic candidate for president was there, right?” he said. “And every single one of them was singing the same tune. Everyone was for a ban on assault weapons and universal background checks. And I was like, ‘Alright, I did my job.’”
Cultural litmus tests have limited the ceiling for Democratic seats in the Senate to 52, Murphy said, and he suggests across-the-board litmus tests might be counterproductive, even on his issue of guns. 
“We maybe should be nominating candidates who believe in the economic populist tentpole but might not line up with us on all of the other cultural, social and hot-button issues,” Murphy said. “That’s a difficult call to make, but I think that might serve two purposes: That might grow the coalition so we win more elections, and that might actually put us in a position to change people’s minds.” 
That was not an applause line, nor did Murphy expect it would be. Murphy was doing his TED Talk thing. He was in teaching mode. 
“Frankly, if you are zeroed in on this question of the billionaire takeover of government, the corporate seizure of our economy, then you can frankly confront the right on their unconscionable scapegoating of gay, transgender kids or immigrants in the exact same sentence in which you are anchoring our message on economic populism, right?” he said.

Distraction and division are elements of Trump’s playbook, he said. Forget about Greenland, the 51st state of Canada and the Gulf of America and keep focused on the real threat of funding tax cuts for the rich by cutting Medicaid, most likely by rolling back the expansion passed as part of the Affordable Care Act. Ninety percent of the expansion is federally funded, and a retreat to the 50-50 state and federal split for the rest of Medicaid would cost Connecticut nearly $1 billion.
“You can say, ‘Listen, the Republicans are corporate shills. They are in the pockets of billionaires, and so they want you to believe that your problems are being caused by gay kids or drag shows or Mexican immigrants,’” Murphy said. “That’s not who’s screwing you, right? Who’s screwing you are unscrupulous insurance companies. What’s screwing you are the tech companies that are poisoning and addicting your kids to their devices. Who’s screwing you is your billionaires who are so rapacious that they’re arguing to cut your insurance off so that they can get another $50,000 tax cut.”
Murphy has been warning about the dangers of disaffection and loneliness since 2022, both in a political and sociological sense. He did so again at the convention center. At a time when the economic metrics were good, he said, too many voters just weren’t feeling it.
“You were seeing epidemic rates of self reported unhappiness in America at a time when unemployment was at a structural low, crime was dropping, test scores were going up,” Murphy said. “And I don’t think you were doing your job as a political leader if you didn’t step back and ask yourself, ‘Why?’ ” 
Democrats didn’t answer that question, at least not in a manner that was heard by disaffected voters, he said. The beneficiary was anyone who practiced the politics of grievance. 
“When you’re feeling powerless, when you’re feeling alone, when you’re feeling empty and devoid of meaning, that’s the moment the demagogues live for, right?” Murphy said. “That’s the moment where somebody who is going to sell a message of division and scapegoating, man, that’s their opportunity.”
Murphy’s higher profile comes at an awkward time. Five days after issuing the election post-mortem, Murphy and his wife, Cathy Holahan, informed friends and, ultimately, the general public of their separation. Five months later, there is no record of either filing for divorce. The topic is one Murphy declines to discuss. 
Last week, the first of the two weeks of the congressional recess, Murphy had no public schedule and spent time with his two sons, who are 13 and 16. Next week, he is going on the road with town-hall meetings in Saxapahaw, N.C., on Thursday and Chesterfield, Mo., on Friday. Both are in Republican congressional districts.

His wingman will be U.S. Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost, an up and coming 28-year-old Democrat who represents the 10th Congressional District of Central Florida. He was with Murphy at his event in Warren, Mich. Elected at age 25, Frost is the youngest and first Generation Z member of the House.
Frost ran with the backing of Sanders, and he appeared on stage with him at the Coachella music festival last week.
“I just think he’s one of a handful of members that is meeting the moment,” Murphy said. “I have a real sense of urgency. And if I’m going to be traveling with somebody, I want them to have the same sense of urgency.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MURPHY-PROFILE-27-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-20 06:02:58.649103

By act of Congress, citizens were asked to turn to their Creator in supplication and meditation. This national day of prayer was to be celebrated in statehouses across the land, with every individual invited to offer hosannas or amens or other holy words of praise. The places of lawmaking were transformed into houses of worship, where the symbols dear to the faithful festooned the galleries and holy banners fluttered from balconies.
When the appointed day arrived, lawmakers made thunderous speeches and pounded their desks in protestations of righteousness. There was no louder din than in the capitol building of an interior province, a region known as much for its piety as for the bountiful harvests of wheat and corn. Under a great copper-sheathed dome, choirs of young people sang the praises of the One who made the sky while lawmakers clustered elbow to bended elbow and murmured their approval.
Few remembered the ancient day when the day of supplication became the law of the land, or the war that had prompted its passage, or the innkeeper and the lawmaker who had championed it. An ambassador of this interior province, was not yet born when the day was proclaimed, but from a dais in the capitol rotunda he addressed the assembled flock.
His face was stern as he clutched his holy book and urged the assembled to celebrate the land’s deliverance from the rule of the godless. At long last the battle for theocracy had nearly been won. The faithful were in power under the great copper dome. It would be a small matter to extinguish the infidels entirely. No true patriot could doubt the land was specially ordained by the Almighty for greatness. Victory was at hand. The ambassador bowed his head and asked the One to bestow wisdom on the leaders of the land. He unashamedly asked this for all in the name of peace and love.
No one could remember a more passionate or powerful sermon.
Then an aged stranger approached. She moved silently down the aisle and mounted the platform, her chalky robe swirling like smoke. Her white hair fell in rivulets to her shoulders. Her face was as pale as those of the statues of long-dead statesmen in the alcoves of the rotunda.
The stranger touched the ambassador on the arm and bid him step aside, which the startled man did. She grasped the lectern with skeletal hands and surveyed the congregation with eyes burning with uncanny light.
“I am sent from the Throne,” she said, her voice solemn and deep. “The One has heard your prayers, and they will be granted — if you wish. But know that for every prayer answered, another must be dashed. Each request for favor brings with it the unspoken plea that another be disfavored. All supplications for earthly power are wishes both selfish and damned.”
Her eyes smoldered.
“You have asked the One for victory,” she said, “so that you might rule this land in the way which pleases you. Very well. I will repeat your prayer, as it falls upon the ears of the One above the clouds.”
There were calls for the capitol guards to remove the stranger, but they stood as transfixed as the crowd.
“Almighty One, grant us the power over our political enemies, so that we may not only exalt You but punish them,” she said, her voice growing stronger. “Let us make laws that take the food from their mouths, the homes of their families, and their ability to pay for medicine and doctors to see them through sickness. Grant us the power to choose in their stead the governing of their bodies and their minds. Allow us to restrict the means of controlling conception and then force women to bear unwanted children, even when violated.”
The stranger paused and clutched the robe to her breast.
“Let us purge from their libraries those books we deem to be improper or impious. Allow us to deny our enemies the ability to seek redress by controlling the manner in which their leaders are selected. Grant us the right to banish from our shores those who utter seditious dissent.”
The crowd grew still.
“Let our enemies live from this day forward with fear in their hearts,” the stranger said. “Let them fear the loss of their positions if they speak of equity or inclusion, make them cower if they dare say azure instead of crimson, allow them pain if they insist on choosing how they shall be called by others. Make their nights sleepless in expectation of a knock at midnight’s door. Grant them freedom of worship only if they worship as we do, deny them public office if they refuse any manner of worship, and enforce the social and marital codes of a society these thousands of years dead.”
The ambassador attempted to mutter “blasphemy,” but the word caught in his throat. The stranger regarded him for a moment with pity, then turned back to the crowd.
“Allow no truth to free a human soul,” the stranger continued. “Shutter the great houses of learning lest a whisper be made against the ambassador or his earthly king. Make a virtue of intolerance and paint it as just. Make retribution the supreme law of the land, power the only virtue, and chaos the only mode. Force them to abandon the sacred civic code that once governed this land, just as we have, and accept in their stead whimsy, nonsense and malice. Allow the land to wither beneath tariffs on foreign things, the fear of strangers, and the rapacious hunger of misers and kings.”
The stranger shook her head and her hair floated cloud-like about her face.
“Finally, Greatest One, ignore the prayers of the meek, the young, the sick and the old,” she said, her voice growing soft. “Comfort not those who pray with pure hearts. Reward not those who thirst for righteousness. Punish those who seek the truth. Banish those who challenge power with fact. All are enemies of the state, Greatest One, and are therefore your enemies. Damn their hopes, dash their dreams, and make their eyes wet with tears. Deny them comfort, afflict their spirits, and fill their hearts with lead. Smite them and their generations to come. Forever make them inequal to us. Grant us the end of history and relieve us of the will to change. This we implore of You, in the name of love.”
The stranger paused.
“This is the prayer of your secret hearts,” she said, her voice a quaver. “If you still desire it, speak! The messenger of the One awaits.”
It was reported afterward that the old woman was a lunatic, because there was no sense in what she said. On the way to the asylum, a copy of Mark Twain’s “The War Prayer” was found in the folds of her voluminous robe.

And for some, the solutions are simple, if impractical.","While I’m on vacation this week I thought I’d revisit a commentary I wrote in 2014. Judge for yourself how little has changed in 11 years.=======================================Everybody loves to complain about our traffic. And for some, the solutions are simple, if impractical. If there were easy answers to our woes, they’d have been implemented by now.
Look… this is really a matter of supply and demand: too much demand (highway traffic) and not enough supply (space on those roads). I think the solution is to manage the demand. But others say it’s a “supply side” issue.


So here are a few of the crazier ideas for fixing our traffic that I’ve seen proposed over the years:
1) Double-deck I-95: Seriously, this was once proposed by the Stamford Chamber of Commerce. Can you imagine the decades of construction and billions in cost, with “upper level” roads having to soar hundreds of feet over existing bridges?
2) Allow trucks on the Merritt Parkway: There are two words to explain why this can’t happen: low bridges.
3) Ban trucks from our interstates: This was once suggested to me by a Fairfield County First Selectman. But as I reminded him… trucks are high-occupancy vehicles delivering goods to the stores where you drive your single-occupancy vehicle to shop. No trucks, no goods, no shopping.
4) Drive in the break-down lane: This was then-Gov. John Rowland’s idea in 2000 and he even wasted a million dollars studying it. But if you think of that far right-hand lane instead as the “emergency rescue lane,” you’ll see why this doesn’t make sense. This plan would also require re-striping the road to create narrower lanes, making driving even more dangerous.
5) Widening I-95 to four lanes: Again, billions in cost and decades of construction. And if you build it, they will come. The immutable law of “induced demand” means that traffic will expand to fill available space. Then what, a fifth lane?
There are better ways to manage congestion, some of them already being implemented:
Operational lanes: Adding a fourth lane from on-ramps to the next off-ramps gives traffic a better chance of merging on and off the highway without blocking the through-lanes.
Widening choke points: For example, the exit 14-15 bottleneck in Norwalk. But this widening project (for less than one mile) cost $50 million and took three years. The I-84 / Route 8 “Mixmaster” rebuild in Waterbury took six years and cost $253 million. Both projects were funded mostly with federal funds, but it’s anyone’s guess what will happen to that money pot under the new administration’s budget cutting.
Add a zipper lane: Sure, this may require highway widening, but just one lane that’s reversible depending on demand, a system that was used successfully on the Tappan Zee Bridge before its reconstruction. By moving the extra lane, capacity can be added to the direction where there’s the most traffic.
Change commuting hours: Does everyone really need to work 9 a.m. – 5 p.m.? How about starting earlier or later and spreading out the traffic? Your employer should understand and you’ll be happier and more productive.
And the very best idea of all: improve mass transit to encourage drivers to  get off of the roads.
As I say, there are no simple solutions to highway congestion. So when anyone says he or she has one, be skeptical. It’s easy to identify the problems. But fixing them will always be hard… and usually expensive.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Traffic-congestion-on-I-95.png,,,2025-04-20 05:00:28.260002

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Major pieces of a $12 billion tax package passed the Washington state Senate on Saturday without a clear sign that Gov. Bob Ferguson supports them.
Democratic senators used their near supermajority to override Republican opposition, approving bills to expand the capital gains tax, increase tax rates on large corporations and big banks, and begin collecting sales tax on an array of services.
Collectively, the legislation would raise around $3.2 billion in the next two-year budget and $5.5 billion over four years, money Democrats are counting on to erase a multibillion-dollar shortfall and enact a balanced budget before the regular session ends next weekend.
The most heated debate Saturday centered on Senate Bill 5814, which produces the most dollars — a projected $2.9 billion in the next budget and $4.7 billion over four years. It would affect an estimated 35,000 firms, according to a Department of Revenue fiscal analysis.
Meanwhile, the House Finance Committee on Saturday advanced the tax package’s other significant components. 
Those measures — expected to receive floor votes Monday in the House — would permanently increase the state’s business tax rate, impose a new sales tax on rented self-storage units, and add a new levy on the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. 
The committee also voted out a bill to lift the cap on annual increases in property tax growth. 
Democrats plowed ahead on these multiple fronts without clarity on how Ferguson would respond if the bills reached his desk.
The first-term governor on Thursday called their $12 billion package “unsustainable” and “too risky,” citing unknowns about the economy and the flow of federal funding with the Trump Administration. Ferguson insisted again that a mix of progressive revenue and spending reductions is needed to resolve the budget issue, but stopped short of specifics.
He met virtually with Democratic leaders Thursday, but did not cite any specific taxes in the package he dislikes. 
Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, who took part in the meeting, didn’t speculate on whether the bills passed Saturday would get signed.
“I can’t speak for the governor,” he said. “This is consistent with what we have talked with him about in terms of our approach on revenue.”
Tax time
When the session began, Democrats forecast the need for new and higher taxes to sustain public services at or near or existing levels. Saturday marked the first time any significant tax measure made it to the floor of either chamber. 
Senate Bill 5814, which passed 27-22, produces the most dollars, an estimated $2.9 billion in the next budget and $4.7 billion over four years. It applies the retail sales tax to more services, such as temporary staffing, advertising, security and lobbying.
Sen. Noel Frame, D-Seattle, the caucus leader on finance legislation, described the bill as making the state’s tax code “more appropriate for the 21st Century.”
“Our taxes fund core public services,” she said. “That’s what this is about.”
Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco, assistant budget leader for the Republican caucus, said there is “nothing modern about this bill.”
“This would be an unprecedented increase in the sales tax,” she said. “We were told that the wealthy need to pay what they owe but this bill hurts everyone.”
Democrats also pushed through Senate Bill 5813 to squeeze more money from the capital gains tax. In addition to the existing 7% tax on gains over $270,000 from the sale or exchange of long-term assets like stocks, bonds and business interests, the bill tacks on another 2.9% for gains exceeding $1 million. It would bring in $282 million in the coming budget and $561 million over four years, a fiscal analysis found. The bill passed 27-21.
Senate Bill 5794 advanced on a 26-22 vote. It revises or repeals a number of tax breaks. Republicans tried without success to preserve some, including exempting operators of self-service storage facilities from paying a business and occupation tax on the renting or leasing of individual units. Most storage unit users are not homeowners, they argued.
“This is a tax on renters,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia.
‘There’s no need’
Pedersen said budget writers “have scrubbed and scrubbed” and come up with $7 billion in savings through cuts, delays and deferrals. He said bills like those Senate Democrats approved are needed for crucial programs related to health care, housing, child care and schools.
Republicans pushed back hard. 
“There’s no need for any of the tax increases,” said Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, who led a GOP effort to craft an alternative budget proposal that doesn’t rely on tax hikes.
He lambasted a provision that requires businesses with $3 million or more in taxable retail sales next year to make a one-time pre-payment of sales tax to the state. This maneuver would pull more tax revenue into the 2025-27 budget that otherwise would have been due the month after it ends.
“This is completely a budget gimmick that should not be tolerated,” Gildon said.
In mid-afternoon, Senate Republicans attempted to pull their budget bill to the floor through a parliamentary move, but failed.
“It doesn’t play games and use ghost money,” Gildon said. “It is the only budget proposal that lives within its means.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1573-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-19 23:06:37.771023

(Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline)Thousands of Coloradans gathered at the state Capitol in Denver on Saturday to attend the month’s second Hands Off! protest against the Trump administration’s policies regarding immigrants, civil rights and marginalized communities. 
The protest was organized by young people from groups like Women’s Strike, Raise Her Voice, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation, according to co-organizer McKenzie Hales, 20. The Colorado State Patrol estimated about 3,000 people were in attendance as protesters began to march at 1:30 p.m. The previous Hands Off! rally in Denver on April 5 attracted more than 8,000 attendees. 
Similar protests happened in cities across Colorado, such as Boulder, Colorado Springs, Grand Junction and Fort Collins. Similar protests were planned throughout the country.
“We deserve a country that doesn’t just say the word ‘freedom’ but one that practices it,” Hales said.

Mandy Swartz, an organizer with Raise Her Voice, a group that teaches political skills to women and marginalized communities, told Colorado Newsline that including young people in the protest is a way to ensure the momentum continues. 
Swartz said she had several “doors slammed in (her) face” as a young organizer, and she wants to change that dynamic for today’s youths.  
“We need to pass the torch on to our youths,” Swartz said. “When we’re gone, we need our youths to carry this on.”

Protesters started gathering at the intersection of Lincoln Street and East 14th Avenue about 90 minutes before the protest began. Many carried upside-down American flags — a symbol of distress — and homemade signs calling for the protection of due process rights for legal immigrants like Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom the administration of President Donald Trump erroneously sent to prison in El Salvador without allowing him to have a court hearing. 
As the crowd grew, protest songs like “For What It’s Worth” by Buffalo Springfield, “Can You Get to That” by Funkadelic, and “Revolution” by The Beatles could be heard playing through loudspeakers. The smell of burning sage and marijuana hung in the air. Passersby honked car horns in a show of solidarity with the protesters. 
Police officers in unmarked cars drove down Lincoln Street to keep protesters on the sidewalks. Once the crowd became too large, police shut down the intersection and diverted traffic away from Lincoln Street.
Speakers highlighted the deportation proceedings against local labor organizer Jeanette Vizguerra as an example of the unfair treatment immigrants are receiving under Trump. Vizgeurra’s arrest drew widespread condemnation across the country, with Denver Mayor Mike Johnston likening it to “Putin-style political persecution.” 
Some also called on congressional and local lawmakers to repair the social contract for marginalized groups like people with disabilities, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community. Others spoke in opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza and what they characterized as America’s complicity in the conflict. 
“Until we address and rebuild America’s foundation, this house will fall,” said Dr. Robert Davis (no relation to the author), an activist with the Denver Task Force to Reimagine Policing.

Clinton, who was president at the time of the attack, returned to the site of the 1995 Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing Saturday to deliver the keynote address to a crowd of over 1,600 that attended to remember and honor those who died and were injured in the attack.
While the event is typically held outdoors at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, the site of the bombing, it was moved indoors due to inclement weather. The crowd that arrived to commemorate the anniversary was so large that once the pews were packed, people stood along the walls and filled an overflow room.

“The domestic terrorists who did this awful thing believed that it would spark a nationwide upheaval against the American government, and would eventually destroy our government, our democracy and our life,” Clinton said. “Instead, you gave them, as the mayor said so eloquently, the Oklahoma Standard. You gave them service, honor and kindness.”
Clinton, a Democrat, came to Oklahoma City days after the 1995 attack to address a devastated crowd assembled at the Oklahoma State Fair Arena. He said he’s returned to Oklahoma City in subsequent years to commemorate the event.
Three decades later, Clinton said that the country has again grown more polarized. When Oklahoma City was the “center of polarization” 30 years ago, it chose to move forward together, he said.
“America needs you, and America needs the Oklahoma Standard,” Clinton said. “And if we all live by it, we would get a fairer economy, a more stable society. We would understand one another, and we wouldn’t feel weak if we admitted we were wrong about something.”
Thirty years ago, a fertilizer and fuel oil bomb placed inside a Ryder truck outside the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City exploded at 9:02 a.m., killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injuring around 850.
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols were arrested for their roles. Both were found guilty. McVeigh was executed June 11, 2001, by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.

Michael Fortier was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to report his knowledge of the bombing plot.
Investigators said McVeigh held extremist views and planned the bombing on the anniversary of the end of the Waco siege between law enforcement and the Branch Davidians.
Other speakers at Saturday’s remembrance event included prominent Republican officials such as Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, former Gov. Frank Keating, and U.S. Sen. James Lankford. Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt also spoke. Most of Oklahoma’s Congressional delegation was present, as were a few other former governors, current state lawmakers and other officials.
There have been nearly “11,000 tomorrows” since the bombing and in Oklahoma City, Holt said, and the city has grown in that time. He said 30 years since the bombing signifies a “generation.”
While younger Oklahomans may not remember the bombing, Stitt said, they live in a state shaped by it and the “commitment to service, honor and kindness” that followed.
Lankford said Oklahomans need to ensure the lessons learned from the bombing and its aftermath are passed to future generations to ensure there is “no generation that rises up that does not remember.”
The Federal Building housed federal agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, the agency that initially launched the Waco raid. But the building also held a day care, military recruitment offices and other various federal agencies.

Family members of victims read the 168 names to the crowd Saturday in an effort to “humanize” the people, said Kari Watkins, president and CEO of the memorial museum.
The building was imploded after the rescue operations and evidence collections were completed. A new federal building was built nearby.
The memorial was built where the old federal building once stood. The 168 chairs erected at the site each represent an empty seat at the dinner table. The smaller chairs represent the children who died. A reflecting pool represents the time between 9:01 a.m. and 9:03 a.m. April 19, 1995. Officials were able to preserve an American elm tree that survived the blast. It is known as the “Survivor Tree.”
In the aftermath of the attack, the state became known for the “Oklahoma Standard,” a term used to describe the “selfless actions” of thousands who offered help.

(Photo via FIU)Florida International University’s police chief believes the university community would be best served by the department signing an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, although the faculty is uneasy. 
During a Faculty Senate special meeting Friday, interim President Jeanette Nuñez, the former lieutenant governor, and FIU Police Department Chief Alexander Casas fielded questions from faculty members about what a 287(g) agreement with ICE will mean for students and faculty, particularly ones fearing detainment.
Under the agreement, FIUPD officers could act as immigration enforcement officials to question and detain people they suspect are in the country without authorization.
“If we have to deliver someone, we’re the ones you want to do it, because it will be done in the most FIU way, the most Panther way, we can think of,” Casas said. 
Casas signed the agreement with ICE, as have several other university police departments in the state, and is awaiting a response from the federal agency before officers can begin training. When it’s signed, Casas said, he will choose his “best officers” to be trained. 
“If I don’t sign that agreement, we open the door for other agencies who are on this agreement, whether they’re federal agencies in power to do so or state agencies directed by our governor or local agencies that have agreed,” Casas said. 
Casas told faculty he wants his department to have a say in how immigration enforcement goes at the South Florida institution.
“Once I deliver someone to Krome or turn them over to ICE, you’re right, I lose control. But, absent this agreement, I don’t even have input. At the very least, once they execute it, at least now I have input and my officers do have a little say in what could be the outcome,” Casas said.
“If it has to happen because there’s a warrant in the system, who do you want interacting with you? God, I hope you say it’s me,” Casas said. 
Nuñez said she spoke at length with Faculty Senate Chair Noël Barengo earlier in the week after he reached out. She added that she wants to make sure she is “constantly addressing concerns.”
Faculty Senate members were not so convinced. Florida universities have made national news for signing the agreement with ICE.
Students live in fear for their ability to remain in the United States, faculty members said. One professor shared about a student who is not a citizen who came to him worried after receiving a parking ticket. 
Juan Gómez, director of the Carlos Costa Immigration Human Rights Clinic at FIU, said students have approached him to say they are afraid to look up items on their computer. Some, in abusive relationships, are afraid to call police. 
“I don’t know the status of any of our students. PD does not have access to any of that information,” Casas said, adding that his department has to follow FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

Casas said he did not get a call from the governor encouraging him to seek a 287(g) agreement; instead, he approached Nuñez after conversations with other law enforcement convinced him it “really is with our best interest at heart.”
Faculty senators approved a resolution opposing the agreement, saying it “goes against the university’s values of truth in the pursuit, generation, dissemination, and application of knowledge, freedom of thought and expression, and respect for diversity and dignity of the individual.” The resolution called for the university to withdraw. 
Well into the two-hour meeting, Philip Carter, an FIU professor, remained unconvinced.
“It’s been good to hear you,” Carter said. “I haven’t heard anything that convinces me that this is a good agreement. It still sounds like a really bad agreement. I still worry about the safety of our students on campus who fear for their status and their safety. I worry, frankly, about all of us, I worry about faculty, I worry that there’s a slippery slope beneath us.”
Nuñez stressed that visa revocations and ICE agreements are different but sometimes get conflated. FIU has no control over visa revocations, she said. 
Earlier this week, FIU confirmed to the Phoenix that 18 students have had their visas revoked since Jan. 1. The University of Florida told the Phoenix that eight visas have been revoked; Florida State University, three.
Alana Greer, director of Community Justice Project, said the FIU 287(g) is “deeply unprecedented” and the “agenda behind relaunching these 287(g)’s is specifically engineered to break trust, to tear apart our communities and to get us to see our neighbors, our peers, our students as ‘other.’”
Greer referenced her involvement with a story the Phoenix reported on Thursday, when 20-year-old Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen, was arrested by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper as an “unauthorized alien” and held for ICE.

The report, written by longtime natural resources manager John Tubbs, calls the financial implications of federal lands transfer “staggering and disproportionately impactful for a rural state with large swaths of national public lands.”
“The costs associated with maintaining national public lands at the state level — ranging from wildfire operations to the loss of essential federal funding for rural counties — would be far too great for Montana to bear per capita,” the report states. It amounts to an $8 billion “gamble on Montana’s future.” 
Tubbs, who authored the report with support from the Montana Wildlife Federation, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Mountain Mamas and the Montana Conservation Voters Education Fund, is the former director of the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation under Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock.
The long simmering dispute over whether the federal government should relinquish lands managed by the Departments of Interior and Agriculture to individual states has been turned up at all levels, from the halls of Congress to Montana’s capitol.
The estimated roughly $8 billion increase to Montanan’s balance sheet would be primarily driven by the costs of managing the land, according to the report, including for wildfire, deferred maintenance backlogs, and abandoned mine reclamation.
Citing reports by the Legislative Fiscal Division, the report states that during the last 20 years, Montana has paid more than $2.3 billion in wildfire mitigation costs on federal land — comprising just 25% of total cost, as the federal government covers 75% of costs. 
A transfer of federal lands to state management would shift the cost of future wildland fire suppression to state taxpayers to the tune of $5.5 billion — the bulk of the total.
On a press call about the report, Tubbs pointed to the essential partnerships with federal agencies  — including the large fleets of firefighting aircraft operated by the Forest Service — and the difficulty in replicating that from the state or private industry. 
“That is untenable,” he said.
 Tubbs also focused on Payment in Lieu of Taxes funds the federal government disseminates. The PILT program channels money to rural counties with swaths of untaxable federal land to support vital services such as public safety, housing, social services and transportation. 
In fiscal year 2023, Montana counties received more than $40 million in PILT funds — and another $16 million from the similar Secure Rural Schools program — a loss the state likely couldn’t make up. 
Tubbs said such a loss would result in the largest “unfunded mandate” in state history, and “several of Montanaʼs counties would be bankrupt—- in particular, the 11 counties in which more than half of the acreage is owned by the federal government.”
The report also states that Montana would be on the hook for $623 million in deferred maintenance and repairs on current federal lands; between $474 million and $1 billion for reclamation work on the state’s 5,000 abandoned mines; and a 1,600% increase in grazing fees. 
 “The state simply cannot afford the responsibility of managing such vast swaths of land without significant financial strain,” the report concludes. 
Tubbs said the value of public lands goes far beyond the numbers, and supporters need to strengthen efforts. 
“The core value I think most of us find in public lands is there’s some landscape that means something to each of us,” he said on the press call. 

Discussions about the federal lands transfer came to the forefront in Washington D.C. and nationwide following statements by the Trump administration that federal lands are part of the nation’s “balance sheet” and could be utilized to help pay off the national debt. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate passed a federal budget in a series of late night votes, and one particular budget amendment saw Montana’s two Republican Senators buck their party. 
The amendment, brought by Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado, would have prevented the sale of public lands to lower the federal deficit. 
Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy joined all Democrats in supporting the amendment, but it was defeated 51-49. 
In a similar vein, Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, Montanan’s western representative, reintroduced his “Public Lands in Public Hands Act,” earlier this year with a Democratic senator from New Mexico.
The provision would ban the U.S. Department of Interior and U.S. Forest Service from selling or transferring “most public lands” except in specific circumstances. It also would require Congressional approval for disposals of publicly accessible federal land tracts over 300 acres and for public land tracts over 5 acres if accessible via a public waterway.
“In Montana, public lands are our way of life. It’s not just Yellowstone and Glacier, it’s also the BLM and Forest Service areas where a kid fills their first tag, a lake in the Beartooths that is the perfect picnic spot, and the trail just down the road that helps you clear your head after a long workday,” Zinke, a former Secretary of the Interior during Trump’s first term, said in a press release. “Public lands must remain public, and the federal government has a responsibility to manage and ensure access to those lands.”
Earlier this month, Montana’s eastern representative, Republican Troy Downing, signed on as a cosponsor to the legislation, as did Idaho Republican Rep. Mike Simpson. 
In Helena this legislative session, Montana’s state lawmakers also got to offer their own takes on the issue thanks to a lawsuit filed by the State of Utah against the federal government in favor of land transfer.
The suit, which claimed federally-managed land infringed on the state’s sovereignty and sought a return of millions of acres, was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Despite that, freshman Rep. Tom Millett, R-Marion, introduced a resolution supporting Utah’s position.
While Millett stated House Resolution 24 did not concern Montana’s federal public lands, his comments were broadly applicable to all states. 
“Nothing in the U.S. Constitution authorizes the federal government to hold vast unreserved swaths of unreserved territory in perpetuity over the states’ express objection,” he told the House Energy, Technology and Federal Relations Committee during a hearing. “The U.S. generates significant revenue from these unappropriated lands — millions of dollars annually that would go toward our counties and schools. But instead, we get but a pittance, leftover crumbs from what should be our lands.”
The bill passed out of committee on partisan lines, but saw broad bipartisan opposition on the floor. 
“Montanans have overwhelmingly rejected transfer time and time again,” Rep. Debo Powers, D-Whitefish, told her colleagues during the debate. “In fact, 87 percent of Montana voters considered the conservation — not the transfer, but the conservation — of public land to be influential in their voting decisions. That’s why so many political candidates in Montana from every political party pledged to keep public lands in public hands.”
The bill failed to pass the House floor in a bipartisan 33-66 vote.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/52200523998_54a5016229_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-19 14:04:23.814161

(Adam Wesley/USA Today)ASHLAND, Wis. — In less than 10 years, three catastrophic floods ravaged northwestern Wisconsin and changed the way people think about water. 
The most severe, in July 2016, slammed Ashland with up to 10 inches of rain in less than a day — a month’s worth of rain fell in just two hours. As rivers swelled to record highs, major highways broke into pieces and culverts washed away. It took months for roads to reopen, with more than $41 million in damage across seven counties. 
The Marengo River, which winds through forests and farmland before meeting the Bad River that flows into Lake Superior, was hit hard during these historic deluges. Centuries earlier, the upper watershed would have held onto that water, but logging and agriculture left the river disconnected from its floodplain, giving the water nowhere safe to go. 
Today, the Marengo River stands as an example of a new kind of solution. Following the record floods, state leaders invested in opening up floodplains and restoring wetlands to relieve flooding. As the need to adapt to disasters grows more urgent, the Marengo River serves as an example that there’s a cheaper way to do so: using wetlands. 
“We can’t change the weather or the patterns… but we can better prepare ourselves,” said MaryJo Gingras, Ashland County’s conservationist. 
 This story is part of the series Down the Drain from the Mississippi River Basin Ag & Water Desk, an independent reporting collaborative based at the University of Missouri in partnership with Report for America, with major funding from the Walton Family Foundation.
Wetlands once provided more natural flood storage across Wisconsin and the Mississippi River Basin, soaking up water like sponges so it couldn’t rush further downstream. But about half of the country’s wetlands have been drained and filled for agriculture and development, and they continue to be destroyed, even as climate change intensifies floods.
As the federal government disposes of rules to protect wetlands, environmental advocates want to rewrite the ecosystem’s narrative to convince more people that restoration is worth it. 
Wetlands aren’t just pretty places, advocates argue, but also powerhouses that can save communities money by blunting the impact of flood disasters. A 2024 Wisconsin law geared at preventing such disasters before they happen, inspired by the wetland work in the Marengo River watershed, is going to test that theory. 
“Traditionally, the outreach has been, ‘We want to have wetlands out here because they’re good for ducks, frogs and pretty flowers,’” said Tracy Hames, executive director of the Wisconsin Wetlands Association. “What do people care about here? They care about their roads, their bridges, their culverts … how can wetlands help that?” 
Bipartisan bill posed wetlands as flood solution
Northern Wisconsin isn’t the only place paying the price for floods. Between 1980 and 2025, the U.S. was struck by 45 billion-dollar flood disasters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with a cumulative price tag of nearly $206 billion. Many parts of the vast Mississippi River Basin receive up to eight inches more rain annually than they did 50 years ago, according to a 2022 analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit organization that analyzes climate science. 
Damaging floods are now so common in the states that border the Mississippi River, including Wisconsin, that the issue can’t be ignored, said Haley Gentry, assistant director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy in New Orleans. 
“Even if you don’t agree with certain (regulations) … we absolutely have to find ways to reduce damage,” Gentry said.
Former Wisconsin state Rep. Loren Oldenburg, a Republican who served a flood-prone district in southwest Wisconsin until he lost the seat last year, was interested in how wetlands could help.
Oldenburg joined forces with Republican state Sen. Romaine Quinn, who represents northern Wisconsin and knew of the work in the Marengo River watershed. The lawmakers proposed a grant program for flood-stricken communities to better understand why and where they flood and restore wetlands in areas that need the help most. 
 
Jennifer Western Hauser, policy liaison at the Wisconsin Wetlands Association, met with Democratic and Republican lawmakers to advocate for the bill. She emphasized problems that might get their attention — related to transportation, emergency services, insurance, or conservation — that wetland restoration could solve. She said she got a lot of head-nods as she explained that the cost of continually fixing a washed-out culvert could vanish from storing and slowing floodwaters upstream. 
“These are issues that hit all over,” she said. “It’s a relatable problem.”   
  State Highway 13, a major north-south route in Wisconsin, collapsed in rural Ashland County in 2016 after a massive rainstorm caused area rivers to swell to record highs. The county used state funds to restore wetlands, hoping to prove that they’re a natural flooding solution.(MaryJo Gingras/Ashland County Land & Water Conservation Dept.)
The bill passed unanimously and was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in April 2024. Evers and the Republican-controlled Legislature approved $2 million for the program in the state’s most recent budget. 
Twenty-three communities applied for the first round of grant funding, which offered two types of grants — one to help assess flood risk, and another grant to help build new wetlands to reduce that risk. Eleven communities were funded, touching most corners of the state, according to Wisconsin Emergency Management, which administered the grants. 
Brian Vigue, freshwater policy director for Audubon Great Lakes, said the program shows Wisconsinites have come a long way in how they think about wetlands since 2018, when the state government made it easier for developers to build in them. 
There’s an assumption that wetland restoration comes only at the expense of historically lucrative land uses like agriculture or industry, making it hard to gain ground, Vigue said. But when skeptics understand the possible economic benefits, it can change things. 
“When you actually find something with the return on investment and can prove that it’s providing these benefits … we were surprised at how readily people that you’d assume wouldn’t embrace a really good, proactive wetland conservation policy, did,” he said. 
Private landowners need to see results
About three-quarters of the remaining wetlands in the lower 48 states are on privately owned land, including areas that were targeted for restoration in the Marengo River watershed. That means before any restoration work begins, the landowner must be convinced that the work will help, not hurt them. 
For projects like this to work, landowner goals are a priority, said Kyle Magyera, local government outreach specialist at the Wisconsin Wetlands Association, because “they know their property better than anyone else.”
Farmers, for example, can be leery that beefing up wetlands will take land out of production and hurt their bottom line, Magyera said. 
In the Marengo watershed, Gingras worked with one landowner who had farmland that wasn’t being used. They created five new wetlands across 10 acres that have already decreased sediment and phosphorus runoff from entering the river. And while there hasn’t been a flood event yet, Gingras expects the water flows to be slowed substantially.
This work goes beyond restoring wetland habitat, Magyera said, it’s about reconnecting waterways. In another project, Magyera worked on a private property where floods carved a new channel in a ravine that funneled the water faster downstream. The property now has log structures that mimic beaver dams to help slow water down and reconnect these systems.

Now that the first round of funding has been disbursed in Wisconsin’s grant program, grantees across the state are starting work on their own versions of natural flood control, like that used in Marengo. 
In Emilie Park, along the flood-prone East River in Green Bay, a project funded by the program will create 11 acres of new wetlands. That habitat will help store water and serve as an eco-park where community members can stroll through the wetland on boardwalks.
In rural Dane County, about 20 miles from the state capital, a stretch of Black Earth Creek will be reconnected to its floodplain, restoring five and a half acres of wetlands and giving the creek more room to spread out and reduce flood risk. The creek jumped its banks during a near record-breaking 2018 rainstorm, washing out two bridges and causing millions of dollars in damage. 
Voluntary program could be of interest elsewhere
Nature-based solutions to flooding have been gaining popularity along the Mississippi River. Wisconsin’s program could serve as a “national model” for how to use wetlands to promote natural flood resilience, Quinn wrote in a 2023 newspaper editorial supporting the bill.
Kyle Rorah, regional director of public policy for the Great Lakes/Atlantic region of Ducks Unlimited, said he’s talking about the Wisconsin grant program to lawmakers in other states in the upper Midwest, and that he sees more appetite for this model than relying on the federal government to protect wetlands.  
And Vigue has found that stakeholders in industries like fishing, shipping and recreation are receptive to using wetlands as infrastructure. 
But Gentry cautioned that voluntary restoration can only go so far, because it “still allows status-quo development and other related patterns to continue.”
Still, as the federal government backs off of regulation, Gentry said she expects more emphasis on the economic value of wetlands to drive protection. 
Some of that is already happening. A 2024 analysis from the Union of Concerned Scientists found that wetlands save Wisconsin and the upper Midwest nearly $23 billion a year that otherwise would be spent combating flooding. 
“Every level of government is looking at ways to reduce costs so it doesn’t increase taxes for their constituents,” Gingras said. 
John Sabo, director of the ByWater Institute at Tulane University, said as wetlands prove their economic value in reducing flood damage costs, taxpayers will see their value. 
“You have to think about (wetlands) as providing services for people,” Sabo said, “if you want to get people on the other side of the aisle behind the idea (of restoring them).” 
And although the Wisconsin grant program is small-scale for now, he said if other states bordering the Mississippi River follow its lead, it could reduce flooding across the region.
“If all upstream states start to build upstream wetlands,” he said, “that has downstream impacts.”

(Courtesy of CleanAIRE NC)Jabaar Edmond has long advocated for better air quality in his Childs Park neighborhood in St. Petersburg, Florida.
For decades, residents of the predominantly Black neighborhood complained of a persistent gasolinelike odor.
“We had an initiative called ‘Smell something, say something,’” said Edmond, former president of the neighborhood’s association. Residents have long sounded that alarm, blaming the noxious odor on a nearby oil recycling facility.
Last year, the city funded the planting of more than 180 trees across the neighborhood. Trees help battle the urban heat island effect and filter pollutants, which can mitigate odors and improve air quality. The project was funded by a federal grant from the U.S. Forest Service.
But now, the agency is hindering such efforts, canceling a grant that supports tree-planting in disadvantaged communities.
Communities across the nation are losing federal funds that helped pay for environmental justice efforts designed to mitigate the health effects of pollution and other hazards on historically underserved communities. President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted those initiatives in its drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs.
Tribes, long shut out from their own health data, fight for access and sovereignty

“Where it hurts for us is we still have a huge environmental problem that’s occurring in real time that we’re attempting to mitigate,” Edmond said.
Environmental justice refers to equitable access to healthy environments. Federal housing policies and disinvestment in historically segregated communities have been linked to numerous health consequences. Communities of color have been disproportionately exposed to refineries and other sources of pollution. Air pollution is linked to asthma, cardiovascular problems and lower life expectancy.
Such systematic, disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants and disinvestment is known as environmental racism. Research shows, for example, that Black Americans living in communities that were redlined — a discriminatory practice under which the federal government and banks systematically denied mortgages to residents of minority neighborhoods — have lower life expectancy and more exposure to air pollution and other hazards. Meanwhile, many tribal communities have been the sites of or near mineral mining and oil and gas development.
The Biden administration awarded grants to help correct those harms, centering environmental justice and climate change across multiple federal agencies. The Justice40 initiative aimed to invest 40% of federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water benefits in historically underserved communities.
Now, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.
Democrats are accusing EPA of illegally canceling the grants, as many were funded through Biden-era congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act. EPA canceled the grants as part of sweeping cuts to what the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency task force deem unnecessary spending. In recent weeks, Democrats have demanded Zeldin reverse the cancellations.
The Trump administration has also shut down the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice, as well as the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.
State environmental and health departments, regulatory agencies, city and county governments, elementary schools, nonprofits and tribal communities were among those that received grants.
The grant-funded projects had a broad range of missions: They included child lead-poisoning prevention efforts, community air monitoring, tree-planting efforts and solar energy investments.
“I don’t know how we’ve come to demonize the idea that people deserve to breathe clean air, drink clean water and have access to environments that are non-polluting,” said Diana Hernandez, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “It’s a big loss, and it’s destabilizing.”
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

Hernandez, a former member of New York City’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board, researches health, housing and energy insecurity. Many of her studies focus on communities like the South Bronx, the neighborhood she calls home, where the air is heavy with emissions because multiple highways converge there. Children and adults in the Bronx have higher rates of emergency room visits for asthma than residents of any other New York City borough.
“I grew up in a community of need. It’s officially labeled as an environmental justice community, a disadvantaged community,” she said. “My mom is my next-door neighbor, and so we weekend in the ’hood. We still have our place there.”
The goal of her work has been to elevate the “lived realities of people in communities like the South Bronx.”
“You can’t take care of people if the organizations and agencies that are looking out for their best interests through oversight are gone,” she said.
‘A gut punch’
Many grantees, particularly those associated with universities, are hesitant to speak out about the impact a loss in funds will have on their projects.
“They’re just struggling and trying to figure out, ‘How do we push back in a way that doesn’t put a target on us?’” said Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government.
His organization is leading a pro bono network offering legal advice to hundreds of groups as well as to state and local agencies whose grants are frozen or canceled.
Hathaway previously served under the Biden administration as director for environmental justice and the White House Interagency Council on Environmental Justice.
“It’s still shocking to me to have these interviews,” he said. “We’re talking about whether or not it’s good for children to be able to drink water safely. It just feels like a gut punch.”
Black children, for example, are more likely to have higher average blood lead levels, from exposure to water pumped through lead pipes in older buildings, as well as through lead paint. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible cognitive development damage in children as they rapidly develop.
Among the grants targeted for cancellation was a $500,000 award to the nonprofit Childhood Lead Action Project, as well as a $1 million award to Kansas City, Missouri, for soil lead mitigation. A $14 million grant awarded to Texas A&M University and the Black Belt Unincorporated Wastewater Program aimed to install wastewater treatment systems throughout 17 Alabama counties. In highly documented cases, residents were contracting infections such as hookworm, more commonly associated with developing countries in the global south, amid a lack of proper, expensive septic systems.










There's just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.


– Ryan Hathaway, director of environment and climate justice at Lawyers for Good Government


CleanAIRE NC, which works to address air pollution across North Carolina, was slated to install 40 air monitors across four low-income white, Black and Hispanic communities in north Mecklenburg County. But about two weeks ago, the group’s $500,000 grant was terminated. The team had used less than half of the funds, and planned to train “air keepers” to track and monitor air quality.
One of the communities included a historic Black neighborhood near old asbestos factories and at the convergence of freeways and industrial complexes, said Executive Director Jeffrey Robbins. Many residents there struggle with asthma and heart disease, he added.
It’s “sad that we’re at this juncture,” Robbins said. “But we’re going to continue to battle and fight for information and the science behind it, and for the communities that are being impacted.”
Dr. Lisa Patel, a Bay Area pediatric hospitalist and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, noted that pollution affects babies’ health even before they’re born.
“The children that I worry about the most are the ones that are placed at a disadvantage before they’ve even drawn first breath,” she said. “Fossil fuel pollution crosses the placenta, enters the developing fetus. And so essentially, children are born pre-polluted, and there’s a higher risk of that if you live in these neighborhoods that tend to be systemically divested.”
Patel said that organizations her group’s research has helped are “trying to find ways to ensure that kids can have a healthy start.”
“And that’s the money that’s being taken away,” she said.
Some states have their own environmental justice agencies or laws and have filed motions to challenge the Trump administration’s direction. Others are continuing to lean on their own agency strategies amid the chaos.
The Massachusetts Department of Health, for example, was awarded a $191,000 grant for an asthma control project, another grant targeted for elimination.
In response to an interview request, an official with the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs said in a statement that the agency will “continue to invest in communities facing environmental challenges and extreme weather events.”
“We’re dedicated to promoting environmental justice and equity by breaking down barriers and creating economic opportunities for communities hit hard by pollution and climate change,” wrote Maria Belen Power, the office’s undersecretary of environmental justice and equity.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Massachusetts, New Jersey and several other states filed a motion to defend a federal chemical accident safety rule. The attorneys general say the rule is a crucial tool to protect vulnerable communities near chemical manufacturing plants.
Continuing efforts
In 2020, New Jersey enacted a landmark law requiring the state to evaluate environmental and public health impacts of facilities on overburdened communities.
The law mandates permit denials if the facilities cannot avoid disproportionate impacts on the surrounding communities already deemed overburdened by industry. The state also uses an environmental public health and environmental justice tracking tool.
“Our [environmental justice] law and our rules are being appealed before our intermediate appellate court right now. There are some industry players who are concerned that it will scare away business,” Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s commissioner of environmental protection, told Stateline.
But LaTourette said the state is not pausing its environmental justice efforts in the meantime.
Meanwhile, Hathaway’s group, Lawyers for Good Government, is hearing from many organizations with unfinished efforts.
“Be it EV charging station infrastructure or improving bus idling in the cities,” Hathaway said. “There’s just so many programs that help neighborhoods be better places to live that states and communities were counting on.”
Abigail Fleming, associate director of the University of Miami’s Environmental Justice Clinic at the School of Law, said many groups the clinic works with have had their federal grants frozen, including grants toward air monitoring in Miami-Dade County and cleaner water.
“There was so much excitement about some of the future of these projects and what they could conquer,” Fleming said.
For Edmond, the St. Petersburg resident, that momentum isn’t over.
“We need to do it with or without the federal dollars,” he said.

(Taiwan Office of the President photo)JUNEAU — Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy flew to Taiwan last month to pitch business and government leaders on Alaska’s state-sponsored liquefied natural gas export project.
The same day Dunleavy and other Alaska officials arrived in Taipei on the unannounced trip, his office received an email from China’s vice consul in San Francisco, Ba Yanfeng. The consulate was aware that Dunleavy was leading a trip to the “province” of Taiwan, and Chinese government officials wanted a meeting with his chief of staff, Ba said.
Dunleavy had stepped into a simmering geopolitical conflict — an issue that China’s government describes as the most important and sensitive in its relationship with the U.S.
 
Take a trip to the Asian island that could play a role in Alaska’s future

	China claims Taiwan as its own territory and regularly conducts military drills nearby — including some that have simulated blockades and involved firing missiles over the island. 
The U.S. doesn’t officially recognize Taiwan’s independence. But it’s a longtime ally, sells arms to the government and has committed in legislation to support the island’s defense.

	In a formal follow-up note, the Chinese government said Dunleavy’s trip “sends a very wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces,” and it urged the governor “to correct such mistakes and avoid their recurrence.”
But Dunleavy, in an interview, said he was undeterred. 
“I don’t allow myself to get pushed around by too many entities or people,” he said.
Alaska does significant trade with China, namely in seafood products, though that’s diminished since President Donald Trump began levying tariffs during his first term. Still, Alaska exports more than $500 million in seafood products to China each year.
But amid China’s broader, ongoing trade war with America, experts said it’s unlikely that the country will target Alaska with retaliatory action even if the LNG project moves forward with Taiwanese partnership.
“I think this is probably fairly low on China’s list of priorities. They have a lot on their plate,” said David Sacks, an expert on Taiwan and China and a fellow for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Sacks described the Chinese correspondence with Dunleavy’s office as “pretty pro forma,” even if it sounds strident. He also said there’s nothing unusual about an American governor or legislator traveling to Taiwan — and he noted that other states, like Arizona, have done robust business with Taiwanese firms without prompting a backlash from China.
“I think it would be fairly unprecedented for the Chinese to take aggressive action here that specifically targets Alaska,” he said.
Dunleavy’s trip to Taiwan last month came amid a new push by his administration to recruit investment in the $44 billion LNG development. Top Trump administration officials have also been touting the project to Asian allies, and a private firm, Glenfarne, has taken over leadership of the development from a state agency.
Dunleavy’s trip also included stops in Thailand, South Korea and Japan, where he met with politicians and corporate executives.
But his Taiwan visit garnered the most headlines. In Taipei, Dunleavy met for an hour with President Lai Ching-te and held a lunch with the vice president, according to his schedule. He also met with officials from Taipower, the country’s primary electric utility, and from the state-owned oil and gas company, CPC.

	CPC has signed a nonbinding letter of intent to buy one-third of the LNG produced by the Alaska project, and the letter also contemplates investment in the development, according to a description by officials from the state’s gas pipeline agency. The letter itself is confidential, according to the agency.
Promoters of Alaska’s LNG project, including Dunleavy and Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, say that investment in and purchases of gas from the development can provide Asian allies with a secure source of fuel — with a shorter transit time than shipments from the Middle East. Importing Alaska gas would also lower Taiwan’s trade deficit with the U.S., which could curry favor with Trump.
But it’s still far from certain that the project will be built. Alaska’s government has spent decades studying construction of a gas line, and the current iteration of the project has been dogged by projected high costs.
Taiwanese investment in the project, and any American engagement with the island’s government, also risk pushback from China.
In a prepared statement to Northern Journal, the spokesman for China’s embassy in Washington, D.C., Liu Pengyu, called Taiwan “an inalienable part of China’s territory” and urged “the relevant U.S. side” to cease all forms of official contact with Taiwan. 
“China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the United States and Taiwan, under any pretext or in any capacity,” the statement said.
Dunleavy, in the interview, said he did not know how the Chinese government became aware of his visit to the island. 
They “wanted me to abort the trip, apparently,” he said.
Dunleavy would not directly say whether he recognizes Taiwan’s sovereignty, calling that “the biggest loaded question.”
“These are human beings, 23 million people. They would like to have a great relationship with the United States,” he said. “We want to sell energy. They want energy. I’d love to partner.”
Alaska has a long history of trade with Taiwan, and other state officials have traveled there in recent years, including two state senators in 2024. Former Gov. Frank Murkowski has visited more than a dozen times, including as an observer of one of Taiwan’s presidential elections.
The Chinese response to Dunleavy’s trip, first reported by conservative news site Must Read Alaska, is “pretty boilerplate,” said Sacks, the expert from the Council of Foreign Relations. 
But its “ominous” language could also be an attempt by the Chinese to ward off business dealings in Taiwan by an American official who’s not well-versed in the island’s tense political dynamics, Sacks added, in comments that were echoed by a statement from the U.S. Department of State.
“Around the world, including in the United States, the Chinese Communist Party attempts to leverage economic and diplomatic pressure to try to prevent officials from interacting with Taiwan,” the statement said. “Robust cooperative activities with Taiwan, including by state leaders, are consistent with U.S. policy.” 
The statement added that the letter of intent from CPC “is another example of the longstanding, deep, and growing trade and investment ties between the United States and Taiwan, which create American jobs and mutual prosperity.”
Sacks said he sees the LNG project as being in America’s interests — both because of its potential to reduce Taiwan’s trade deficit and to give its people a more reliable supply of energy. 
But while Sacks described the risk of repercussions to Alaska as low, he also wouldn’t completely rule them out. He pointed to a recent move by China instructing the nation’s airlines to stop accepting deliveries of jets made by Boeing. 
“The context might change now, because the Chinese are looking for ways — in a way that they weren’t before — to punish the Trump administration for the tariffs,” Sacks said. “I wouldn’t foreclose that.”

States across the country are worried about losing pandemic aid that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending. (Photo by Stephen Smith/The Associated Press)Early this month, the U.S. Department of Education issued an ultimatum to K-12 public schools and state education agencies: Certify that you are not engaging in discrimination under the banner of diversity, equity and inclusion, or risk losing federal funding — including billions in support for low-income students.
The backlash was immediate. Some states with Democratic governors refused to comply, arguing that the directive lacks legal basis, fails to clearly define what constitutes “illegal DEI practices,” and threatens vital equity-based initiatives in their schools.
After lawsuits from the National Education Association teachers union and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Department of Education agreed to delay enforcement until after April 24.
But states across the country, both liberal- and conservative-led, are worried about losing other aid: the pandemic-era money that in some cases they’ve already spent or committed to spending.
The Department of Education has long played a critical role in distributing federal funds to states for K-12 education, including Title I grants to boost staffing in schools with high percentages of low-income students, and emergency relief like that provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conservative-led states — particularly Mississippi, South Dakota and Arkansas — rely the most heavily on these funds to sustain services in high-need districts.
The 15 states with the highest percentage of their K-12 budget coming from federal funding in fiscal year 2022 — the latest year with data available from the National Center for Education Statistics — voted for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Similarly, 10 of the 15 states receiving the highest amounts of Title I funding in fiscal year 2024 also voted for Trump.
Mississippi and Kentucky have sent letters to the Department of Education expressing concern over halted pandemic aid.
The clash over federal funding comes even as the future of the Department of Education is murky, given President Donald Trump’s pledge to dismantle the department.
In Iowa, 14% of the state’s K-12 budget was funded by the federal government in 2022, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, with a total of $1.13 billion.
DEI-related cuts
In letters to the Department of Education, state officials and superintendents in Illinois, New York and Wisconsin pushed back against the DEI directive.
New York officials said they would not provide additional certification beyond what the state already has done, asserting that there “are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.” Illinois Superintendent Tony Sanders wrote that he was concerned that the Department of Education was changing the conditions of federal funding without a formal administrative process. Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly questioned the legality of the order.
New York State Department of Education Counsel and Deputy Commissioner Daniel Morton-Bentley noted that the federal department’s current stance on DEI starkly contrasts with its position during Trump’s first term, when then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos supported such efforts.
Colorado and California also confirmed they would not comply with the Department of Education’s order.
While some states with liberal leaders are gearing up for legal battles and possible revocation of funding, conservative-led states such as Florida have embraced the federal directive as part of a broader push to reshape public education.
In Florida, anti-DEI laws have been in place dating back to 2023. In fact, many school districts and the state education department say they plan to follow the federal department’s directives, noting the similar state laws.
Pandemic aid cancellations
In March, the Department of Education abruptly rescinded previously approved extensions of pandemic-era aid, ending access to funds months ahead of the original March 2026 deadline.
When the Massachusetts governor’s office voiced concern over that decision, the federal department’s reply on social media was blunt: “COVID is over.”
Sixteen mostly Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia filed a federal lawsuit against the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon, challenging the abrupt rescission of previously approved extensions for spending COVID-19 education relief funds.
But backlash against abrupt federal cuts to education has not been limited to blue states.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs
Mississippi’s Department of Education warned the cuts would jeopardize more than $137 million in already obligated funds, slated for literacy initiatives, mental health services and infrastructure repairs. “The impact of this sudden reversal is detrimental to Mississippi students,” state Superintendent Lance Evans wrote in a letter to McMahon.
The letter also outlines the state’s repeated — but unsuccessful — efforts to draw down millions in approved funds since February.
Shanderia Minor, a spokesperson for the Mississippi education department, told Stateline the agency is awaiting next steps and direction about the funds and federal directives.
In Kentucky, state Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher told districts — which stand to lose tens of millions in pandemic aid — that abrupt federal changes leave them “in a difficult position,” with schools already having committed funds to teacher training and facility upgrades.
According to Kentucky Department of Education spokesperson Jennifer Ginn, the state has about $18 million in unspent pandemic aid funds left to distribute to districts. And districts have about $38 million in unspent funds, for a total $56 million that could be lost.
Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher, told Stateline that schools that receive Title I money are already underfunded — and the federal threat only widens the gap.
“Florida is pouring billions into education — but where is it going? Because we’re not seeing it in schools, especially not in Title I schools,” said Farrow. “I taught five minutes away from a wealthier school, and we didn’t even have pencils. Teachers were buying shoes for students. Why is that still happening?”
Effects in the classroom
Tafshier Cosby, senior director of the Center for Organizing and Partnerships at the National Parents Union, a parents advocacy group, told Stateline that while most families don’t fully understand the various school funding systems, they feel the impact of cuts in the classroom.











There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.


– Lauren Farrow, a former Florida public school teacher



Cosby said parents are worried about the loss of support services for students with disabilities, Title I impacts, and how debates about DEI may deflect from more urgent needs like literacy and teacher support.
“We’ve been clear: DEI isn’t the federal government’s role — it’s up to states,” she said. “But the confusion is real. And the impact could be devastating.”
Today, as a consultant working with teachers across Florida’s Orange County Public Schools — one of the largest districts in the country — Farrow says many educators are fearful and confused about how to support their students under changing DEI laws.
“Teachers are asking, ‘Does this mean I can’t seat a student with glasses at the front of the room anymore?’ There’s so much fear around what we’re allowed to do now.”
“There’s no one giving teachers guidance or even basic acknowledgment. We’re just left wondering what we’re allowed to say or do — and that’s dangerous.”

(Photo by Lanny Hartmann)In 2023, Gov. Wes Moore joined Maryland to California’s Advanced Clean Cars II program, pledging to slash greenhouse gas emissions by phasing out gasoline vehicle sales by 2035. Barely two years later, he signed an executive order delaying penalties for these Zero-Emission Vehicle Goals, blaming insufficient charging infrastructure.
The real culprit? A large portion of Maryland’s public chargers are utility-owned and routinely broken — mocking the drivers who rely on them and the ratepayers who funded them.
Since 2019, the Maryland Public Service Commission has let utilities like BGE, Pepco, Delmarva Power, Potomac Edison and SMECO operate public EV chargers in a pilot program now nearing its end. BGE alone spent $15 million installing chargers at libraries, parks and government buildings.
The utilities vowed these stations would match the reliability of their electric grid. Instead, they’ve delivered a charging disaster. Now, they want four more years — and more ratepayer cash — to keep it limping along.

The utilities’ pitch in 2018 was simple: Give us millions, and we’ll build a dependable electric vehicle network. But drivers know the truth: These chargers are often down. Worse, utilities outsourced most operations to third-party contractors. When a charger fails, EV drivers don’t call BGE for a quick fix — they’re stuck dialing a “network provider,” where complaints vanish into a virtual black hole, sometimes taking months to resolve. This isn’t service; it’s abandonment.
In 2023, the General Assembly demanded accountability, passing House Bill 834, the Electric Vehicle Charging Reliability Act, requiring 97% uptime, backed by quarterly reports and penalties for failure. Two years on, the Public Service Commission has yet to see those reports. Drivers, meanwhile, feel reliability worsening.
Moore’s executive order, citing the very infrastructure utilities failed to deliver, only deepens the distrust — easing pressure on automakers instead of fixing the public charging networks.
Fed up, I joined 12 other Maryland EV drivers to survey every fast charger statewide. Our Maryland Fast Charger Survey visited 304 locations, testing over 1,000 ports.
Tesla, running more than half of Maryland’s fast chargers, delivered 99.6% availability — 541 of 543 ports worked. BGE? A measly 33% (30 of 90 chargers operational). Delmarva Power’s Eastern Shore network was the worst at 31% (4 of 13). These aren’t chargers; They’re proof utilities can’t deliver.
Now, utilities propose bigger budgets for a second phase of the pilot program, funneling more money to contractors for obsolete chargers. Unlike Tesla’s stations—built near 24-hour stores with 8 to 16 plugs pumping up to 325 kW—most utility chargers are stuck at 50 kW, often with just one or two ports. They’re not at vibrant hubs but in desolate corners of parking lots, like behind state office buildings.
Why pour millions into slow, outdated chargers nobody wants to use?
Moore’s order admits the infrastructure isn’t ready, but after six years, that’s no excuse — it’s a failure of leadership. Utilities have had time and money to build a network that works. Instead, they’ve squandered trust and dollars.
The Public Service Commission must end this failed experiment, redirect funds to proven models like supporting commercial charger programs, and demand Moore recommit to Zero-Emission Vehicle Goals with infrastructure that delivers. Marylanders deserve better than broken chargers and weak promises. It’s time to pull the plug.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/54447410884_ae7daf624d_k-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-19 09:02:08.318787

(Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)Five years of COVID-era relief for federally-insured mortgages has helped millions of American homeowners retain their properties, while artificially inflating home prices and leading to the potential for Bubble 2.0, insist some experts who are hailing a decision from President Donald Trump’s administration, announced Tuesday, to end one program in September.
The move comes after President Joe Biden, days before leaving office, instructed the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make the relief efforts permanent.
Critics of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) COVID relief policy, which allows the agency to front payments on behalf of troubled borrowers, say it’s keeping unqualified borrowers in their homes without making a payment for two to three years, and delaying scarce inventory from going on the market.
COVID-era mortgage relief, initiated by Trump in 2020 and extended by Biden in 2021, “has created another subprime housing bubble and put taxpayers at risk. Trump should end it,” says a February editorial in the Wall Street Journal. “Under the guise of Covid relief, the Biden administration masked the growing troubles in the housing market by paying off borrowers and mortgage servicers to prevent foreclosures. Of the 52,531 FHA loans last year that went seriously delinquent within their first year, only nine resulted in foreclosure.”

Nationwide one in every 1,515 housing units had a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of 2025, reports ATTOM Data, a real estate analyst.  Nevada ranked third in the nation for the highest rate of foreclosure filings (behind Delaware and Illinois) with one filing for every 874 housing units.
By comparison, in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, one in 14 Nevada homes received a default notice.
‘Canary in the coal mine’
The national delinquency rate for all mortgages, which topped 10% during the Great Recession, has been rising for more than a year and edged up to 3.53% in February, according to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a housing finance company.
FHA mortgages, which make up less than 15% of all active home loans, but allow higher debt ratios and smaller down payments than other loans, accounted for 90% of the 131,000 home loans that went delinquent last year, ICE reports.
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, tweeted last month the FHA delinquency rate is “Leading Indicator #2,” behind only consumer confidence on his recession watch, calling it “a proverbial canary in the coal mine…”
“Not that the financial troubles of FHA borrowers are enough to push the economy into recession. Indeed, high and middle-income mortgage borrowers are having no trouble making their payments at this time – the gap between the FHA delinquency rate and those on Fannie and Freddie loans has never been as large,” Zandi wrote. “But if the economy is headed for trouble, it is FHA borrowers who will signal it first. And they are.”
FHA loans, which are targeted to low-credit, first-time buyers, are a popular option for Nevada borrowers. In 2024, FHA served 766,942 new borrowers nationwide, including just under 11,000 in Nevada, according to its annual report.
Additionally, some 3,500 Nevadans have received assistance via federal relief programs in the last three years, according to the website for the Nevada Affordable Home Assistance Corporation’s (NAHAC), which administers relief programs for some 80 lenders.
‘Extend and pretend’ 
The COVID relief program allows FHA to make payments, called partial claims, (‘partial’ because the payment is not covering the entire debt) on behalf of delinquent borrowers, and add the amount fronted by the government to the back end of the loan, interest free. The FHA payments on behalf of borrowers cannot exceed 30% of a loan’s unpaid principal balance.
“Consider a borrower who misses five $4,000 monthly mortgage payments,” says the WSJ editorial. “The servicer will add the $20,000 in missed payments to the mortgage and reduce monthly payments by $1,000 for three years—adding another $36,000 to their mortgage. So the borrower is $56,000 deeper in debt, though with no additional interest.”
Mortgage expert John Comiskey projects the FHA “made ~2.6 billion dollars in mortgage payments from these stand alone partial claims last year.” Records analyzed by Comiskey indicate some borrowers made no payments for several years, with the FHA stepping in to bring their loans current every three to four months.
Comiskey, who calls the effort “an abject FHA loss mitigation policy failure,” tweeted last month that about 70% of some 160,000 FHA Covid relief modifications originated during the past two years are delinquent, and about 55% are seriously delinquent.
“The extend and pretend music is still playing for these mortgages, though that music now has an end date, and when it stops many of these mortgages will head to foreclosure,” Comiskey wrote last month. On Wednesday, the day after HUD’s announcement, he predicted the end of FHA loss mitigation “will start hitting housing transactions in early ‘26 with maybe some precursor effect late this year.”
“Let’s not forget the reason why most of these people are in trouble. It’s not because they make bad decisions like in 2008,” says longtime Las Vegas Realtor Steve Hawks, referring to borrowers who purchased multiple properties with no-money-down loans. “They’re in trouble because they can’t afford the cost of living. The home they bought for $300,000 is now $550,000. Their property taxes and home insurance have gone up. The cost of maintenance has gone through the roof. They’re using credit cards for everyday expenses.”
It’s unknown how many Nevada homeowners will be affected.
“FHA does not have publicly available information on its home retention solutions by state or dollar amount,” a HUD spokesperson said via email.
Hawks projects Nevada’s phantom inventory of homes with non-performing loans, but no public record of default, could be in the tens of thousands.
“It’s not rocket science,” he says, adding the writing was on the wall when home prices soared and inventory dropped in 2021 and 2022. “A lot of people that were going to sell took their houses off the market,” and opted for loan modification and forbearance programs.












“Let’s not forget the reason why most of these people are in trouble. It’s not because they make bad decisions like in 2008.”

FHA officials contend the relief has worked, and maintain it is fronting payments on behalf of a small percentage of borrowers. The measures “have proven to be effective in helping struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure and reduce losses,” FHA Commissioner Julia Gordan said just days before Biden left office.
From April of 2020 through September 2024, some 1.7 million FHA borrowers took part in COVID-19 forbearance, according to the agency’s 2024 annual report to Congress. Of those, 77% were able to get back on track, either paying off their loan or becoming current on their mortgages. Some 371,000 borrowers (22%) remained in delinquency or forbearance.
As of September 2024, FHA held active mortgage insurance on 7.81 million single family mortgage loans. The share of FHA borrowers who are seriously delinquent stood at 4.15% in September 2024, a slight increase from a year ago but consistent with rates seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Of some 425,000 loss mitigation actions reported by FHA to Congress in its 2024 annual report, just under 324,000 were partial claims.
Loan servicers receive a monetary incentive for participating in the relief program – between $500 and $1,750 every time the FHA steps up on behalf of borrowers.
“The FHA made 556,841 ‘incentive payments’ to servicers over the past year to prevent foreclosures—nearly as many as the new mortgages it insured,” says the WSJ editorial. “Government-backed mortgage relief has become a cash cow for servicers, some of which originated the risky loans they are paid not to foreclose. Moral hazard, anyone?”
Las Vegas real estate expert Tony Ricco says he contacted an FHA lender in an attempt to buy delinquent loans but was turned down. “Why would they sell them? They’re getting paid by the federal government on non-performing loans.”
Ricco says the level of manipulation in the housing market is preventing “true price discovery” and “is skewing housing to be unaffordable.”
The end of FHA loss mitigation could see “some additional homes entering the market from the seller’s side as either those borrowers are forced to sell to avoid foreclosure or once the foreclosure is complete,” says Nicholas Irwin, Research Director at UNLV’s Lied Center for Real Estate. “The tricky part is that foreclosed homes become HUD homes and I don’t know how quick the process is from foreclosure to on the market.”
Additional housing supply results in downward pressure on prices, Irwin says. “How much of an effect will depend on how many folks are impacted in our area.”
Unlike 2008, when most properties were privately held, government-sponsored entities such as FHA, the Veterans Administration, the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, have skin in the game on about half of all mortgages.
“The government’s not going to foreclose on these people just to put them on another relief program,” Hawks said. “That’s why they’ve been letting them go for this long.”

Allen, reading letters from students he said support the requirement, spoke at length as Senate Republicans were filibustering their own bills to keep Democrats from speaking. Democratic senators in a committee hearing in early April said that it would require students to be exposed to parts of the song, particularly the third stanza, which critics have said is an attack on Black Americans who escaped slavery by joining the British Army.

Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, said after the bill’s passage that it potentially violates children’s constitutional rights, particularly free speech.
“When you start talking about fundamental rights. I think that’s going to be something that’s going to be challenged in courts too, in terms of whether or not — the constitutionality of — can you make kids listen to that on a daily basis, who may not want to and refuse,” Singleton said.
He also opposed making it a constitutional amendment, saying it would be “a forever permanent piece of law,” which he said was unnecessary. He said lawmakers should instead be focused on creating jobs and improving education in the state.
“I, too, am America, but do I have to love something that talks about me and the history of my slavery, that degrades me and my people? No, I don’t. So why make children have to sing that in school?” Singleton asked.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.












The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology




Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

(Photo courtesy of Washington State Department of Transportation)A creative plan in the Washington Legislature to raise billions of dollars to pay for the court-ordered removal of fish passage barriers appears to be a pipe dream, for this year at least. 
With just over a week until the scheduled end of the legislative session, the state Senate’s bipartisan proposal to borrow up to $5 billion to eliminate culverts faces, well, barriers on several fronts. 
Cities and counties fear missing out on state dollars for water, sewer and other projects that would be diverted to repay the culvert-removal bonds. 
And the governor’s office says the plan is coming at a bad time, given broad economic uncertainty.
The measure looked to help fulfill the state’s obligations under a 2013 federal injunction that the U.S. Supreme Court later upheld.
A judge found the state violated tribes’ treaty fishing rights by installing poorly designed and maintained culverts, typically pipes under roads or other infrastructure meant to allow water to flow. The judge’s order forced the state to pay to correct these barriers that impede salmon and steelhead migration in western Washington. 
The target has been to open up 90% of the habitat that culverts have long blocked by 2030. 
The state’s transportation department has estimated needing to address another 300 barriers to hit the benchmark. The most expensive remaining culvert projects range from $80 million to $240 million.
So last year, state officials returned to court to acknowledge they couldn’t meet the goal, as project costs have skyrocketed, and new barriers have been found.
The state and the 21 tribes that brought the original lawsuit are now going to mediation to potentially figure out a new path, recognizing Washington’s financial reality. 
Lawmakers hoped the cash infusion would show a good-faith effort to comply with the order as mediation begins. But opposition to the bond proposal appears insurmountable. 
“The state obviously has an obligation to meet,” said Rep. Steve Tharinger, D-Port Townsend, the House’s capital budget lead. “The question is how.”
The maneuver
The state’s transportation budget has traditionally paid for culvert projects. 
But like the state’s operating budget, transportation faces a major shortfall over the next few years. And the capital budget for construction projects is healthier, so senators moved the culvert funding over. 
This allowed the Senate transportation budget writers to cut in half their projected $8 billion shortfall over the next six years.
The transportation budget proposal from House Democrats does not include such a funding flip, instead earmarking more than $5 billion over the current budget and the next three budget cycles to pay for barrier elimination. The two chambers are currently negotiating over transportation funding.
The $5 billion in new bonds included in Senate Bill 5804, unveiled late last month, wouldn’t have to go toward state culvert removals specifically. The money could be used for both local and state projects identified as necessary through mediation. 
Even after the state removes its culverts, other downstream and upstream barriers continue to block fish passage and thwart Washington’s progress. 
Lawmakers looked to repay the bonds with revenue from an existing tax on electrical utilities that usually goes toward grants and loans for local public works departments. 
Enter the first concern: Local governments worry the redirection would threaten ongoing state money specifically set aside for their public works projects.  
The proposal’s supporters take issue with that critique. 
Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville, said “some people are screaming wolf,” noting the capital budget proposal he helped write backfills the hole in public works money with $150 million in other bonds, for a total earmark of $250 million.
But Gov. Bob Ferguson has also snubbed the scheme. 
A letter from his budget director tells lawmakers that “given market uncertainty and volatile interest rates, this is not the time to explore a novel form of bonding outside of the state’s constitutional debt limit.”
The bonds the bill authorizes are separate from the “general obligation” bonds the state otherwise commonly uses. The usual bonds have low interest rates because they’re backed by the “full faith, credit, and taxing power of the state,” under the state Constitution. The proposed bonds are not, so they would carry higher borrowing costs.
The input disappointed Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma. 
“My hope would’ve been that the governor would’ve been more enthused about this path forward,” she said, noting Ferguson was attorney general when the court case was decided.
Estimates from the state treasurer’s office also raised doubts that the utility tax could even generate the revenue necessary to service $5 billion in new debt.
Schoesler said he’s waiting for his colleagues to offer an alternative solution to what he described as “one of the biggest financial challenges” facing the state. 
“Show me a better idea,” he said.

[…]","Billy Long speaks during a press conference before filing for to be on the ballot in the Missouri GOP Senate primary on Feb. 22, 2022, in Jefferson City (Madeline Carter/Missouri Independent).Former Missouri Congressman Billy Long received $137,000 in campaign contributions — just enough to pay off a personal loan to his campaign — soon after he was tapped to lead the Internal Revenue Service.
 Some of the donations are connected to companies that will be policed by the agency Long has been nominated to run.
According to recently filed financial disclosures, which were first reported on by the investigative journalism site The Lever, Long only raised roughly $36,000 in the last two years. 
He was named as President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the IRS in December, and in January received $137,000 in donations. He then paid back the remaining $130,000 in debt from a $250,000 loan he made to his unsuccessful 2022 U.S. Senate campaign.
The donations, and their timing, have renewed criticism of Long’s appointment, which still awaits Senate confirmation. Senate Democrats have already called for a criminal investigation of firms with ties to Long that they allege are involved in fraudulent tax credit schemes. 
Among the donors to Long’s campaign are financial advisers from some of those firms.
“When they told Billy he’d be in charge of revenue collection, did they forget to tell him that meant for the American people, not his own bank account?” said Sean Nicholson, a longtime progressive activist and campaign consultant in Missouri. 
Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for the liberal watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the timing of the donations and the “explicit knowledge that they’d end up directly in Long’s bank account, it’s hard to see them as anything other than an attempt to curry favor with the future head of the IRS.”
Long did not respond to a request for comment. 
Billy Long, Trump’s nominee to lead IRS, touts credential tax experts say is dubious

After a career as an auctioneer and conservative radio host, Long served six terms representing a Southwest Missouri congressional district. He gave up his seat to run for U.S. Senate in 2022, losing in the GOP primary to now-Sen. Eric Schmitt. 
Long then worked for Lifetime Advisors and earned at least $5,000 in income from White River Energy. Both companies have drawn scorn from Senate Democrats, and intense media scrutiny, over their involvement in controversial tax credit programs. 
In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a limit on the amount of post-election funds a candidate can use to pay back personal loans. The majority found the limit an unconstitutional restriction on the freedom of speech, while the dissenting justices argued removing it would pave the way for political corruption.  
“Even if our broken campaign finance system allows this behavior,” Libowitz said, “it raises serious questions about future conflicts of interest and needs to be addressed in any hearings (Billy Long) has before Congress.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/candidatefilingday02222022000026-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-19 07:05:57.798734

Yet, all children and families are stretched thin, doing their best in systems that weren’t built for everyone to succeed—especially those who have been historically left behind.
Child maltreatment is a preventable, solvable, public issue when we invest in support and services for families when they need them. But for every $10 the U.S. spends on child welfare, only $1.50 goes toward primary prevention. That means most funding goes toward reacting after abuse or neglect has already happened—when investing earlier could strengthen families and give all children the nurturing, positive childhoods they deserve.
April is Child Abuse Prevention Month and it’s a time to promote the positive solutions that strengthen families and build strong foundations for children. This year’s campaign theme is Powered by Hope, Strengthened by Prevention. HOPE stands for Healthy Outcomes from Positive Experiences. Positive Childhood Experiences (PCEs) are experiences in childhood that build a child’s sense of belonging and connection. Studies indicate that the absence of positive experiences has a bigger impact on our health and wellbeing than the presence of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs).
And we do feel hopeful this Child Abuse Prevention Month.
North Carolina Governor Josh Stein recently proposed over half a billion dollars in targeted tax relief to help working families cover the high costs of child care and other essential expenses that come with raising children, including:

Working families tax credit – 20% of federal Earned Income Tax Credit, worth up to $1,600
Child Tax Credit – Up to $300 for family of four
Child & Dependent Care Tax Credit – up to $600 for family of four
Back to school tax holiday

These proposals from the Governor are aligned with Positive Childhood Alliance North Carolina’s policy priorities and the positive experiences we hope to grow for all North Carolina children and families.
Just like no family can do it alone, neither can one single organization or agency. We urge the community to let your legislators know how these investments can strengthen families and prevent child abuse. It takes all of us—families, communities, policymakers, and organizations working together in partnership by:

Focusing on community-based solutions, such as local organizations like Family Resource Centers supporting families where they live.
Connecting families with support systems and building networks to support families and strengthen communities.
Advocating for policy change with programs and policies that help all children and families thrive– like affordable childcare, paid leave, and financial stability.

When parents and caregivers are overloaded with stress from financial insecurity, lack of health care, unstable housing, or the high cost of childcare, it’s like a car carrying too much weight—eventually, it breaks down. That overload of stress can then lead to a cascade of other problems including substance use, depression, and mental illness, some of the other major risk factors for maltreatment.
We must advance policies and practices that create the conditions proven by research to reduce the risk of maltreatment—because responding after harm has occurred is not enough. Addressing root causes by providing concrete support for parents is one of five protective factors proven to lower the risk of child maltreatment. Solutions such as paid family leave, housing assistance, and affordable childcare lightens the load and better equips parents to ensure their children’s well-being.
In addition, research shows that for every $1,000 that states invest in families living in poverty, Child Protective Service rates, foster care entries, and child fatalities drop. To reduce the number of children entering our child welfare system, which is also stressed and overloaded, we must invest in creating positive environments and experiences for families so that their children can thrive.
The bottom line: financial stability is foundational. By ensuring all families have access to support before challenges become crises, we can create a future filled with hope and opportunity. That’s good public policy and will create a healthier, more prosperous future for us all.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Postive-Childhood-Alliance-1024x459.png,,,2025-04-19 07:05:57.798734

Therefore, the relevant question we must ask ourselves writ large is this: is our goal as a society true justice or simply punishment? 
Research by pioneering psychologists like Erikson and Piaget is so respected that it is routinely taught in psychology textbooks. Although not indicated by name, that foundational research and the court’s indication that the neuroplasticity of a developing brain before the age of 25, as well as relevant case law, was instrumental in the decision to disallow the affected age group to be automatically sentenced to life without parole for first degree murder (building on the 2022 decision regarding 18-year-olds).  
Utilizing prevailing research as a component of legal decision-making is a win for logic, reasoning, and science but the dissenting opinion of the decision cannot be ignored. The dissent, penned by Chief Justice Clement, indicated that first degree murder is a grave offense, and, a “…punishment of great severity is therefore proportionate,” while also indicating that the majority decision focuses on examining the offender and not the offense.  
Therein lies the issue with what we tell ourselves, as a society, about how and why we incarcerate and hints at the reasoning behind the United States leading all developed nations in per capita prison populations.  Especially in Michigan. 
This is all rooted in the notion that we, as a society, view ourselves as a rehabilitative one that values change and personal responsibility… in theory. Faith-based and popular media stories routinely feature redemption arcs of men and women that have committed heinous crimes and acts but can find a place in society through change and sacrifice.  
The belief in these redemption arcs seem to end with Michigan’s prison population wherein, much like the dissenting opinion, a blanket punitive sentence is applied regardless of the rehabilitative potential of the offender. In large part based off the “tough on crime” rhetoric of the 1990s, the state is left with a prison population serving long sentences far greater than the majority of other states. The Council on Criminal Justice (2023) indicated that 66% of Michigan’s prison population is serving 10+ years based on 2016 releases and the average sentence is 20 years, which is much higher than most other states.  
It appears that we have not only given up the idea of rehabilitative incarceration but moved in the exact opposite direction. To date, the youngest ‘juvenile lifer’ in the state was Dontez Tillman. He was sentenced in 2011 at the age of 17 to life without parole for participating in the murder of a homeless man with friends where he was first arrested and in the system at 14. In 2025, he is now 30 years old. While Tillman was subsequently resentenced in 2015 to a term of 32-and-a-half to 60 years in prison, the earliest he could be set free is 2041.
If we continue to apply that blanket approach to sentencing and noting that only these long sentences can keep our communities safe, then are we to throw out the entirety of research on the matter, our purported belief in the ability for one to redeem themselves, and basic common sense? 
Although I have never met Mr. Tillman, I have encountered and worked in an academic and forensic setting with many men and women who are currently serving very long sentences for crimes committed in their youth. I would hazard that Mr. Tillman is a functionally different person than he was when he was in his adolescence. Recrimination and remorse are routinely part of an incarcerated person’s daily existence, but the system that we have in place does not have a mechanism to recognize that. If one can grow, learn, and become fundamentally changed in one environment, then that should apply to all environments… including our prison system. 
In addition, think of the standard brain development the court used to base the recent decision on. Brain development and socialization are not standardized, of course, but Piaget, Erikson, and others have mapped out general stages. However, some differences are common. This is under the assumption that development and socialization take place in an average society. What if, like Mr. Tillman and many others, that development takes place in a prison environment? 
There are no predictors on what incarceration does on brain development for adolescents, but the effects of incarceration on adults are startling. A rehabilitant society would never entertain the thought of allowing young people who have made terrible mistakes and choices to simply rot and, essentially, grow up in one of the most violent and hopeless landscapes imaginable.  
Yet, fear still pervades our societal view, and that fear means we must do whatever possible to ensure our safety. Just as long as that safety does not involve investing in the future of groups of people that we have already labeled as ‘monsters’ or ‘evil’. The use of those terms is low-hanging fruit for fearmongers, allowing an arbitrary, and largely fantastical, definition of a word to become the reasoning for disallowing a person to grow beyond what is ofttimes a single, horrible decision on a single, horrible day.  
As it stands, long prison sentences do nothing to actually make Michigan safer. They are not a deterrent to crime, quite obviously, and only function to punish without recourse. We only talk the rehabilitative game. 
Kudos to the Michigan Supreme Court for the current decision, but it does little to address the larger, systemic issues in sentencing in Michigan. As a society, allowing this decision to alleviate whatever pangs of guilt are felt whenever we see that our courts, much like an overzealous bartender, over serve justice to the cheers of voters is dangerous. I fear most people would agree with Chief Justice Clement’s dissent.

Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's pick for HHS secretary, appears at his nomination hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Jan. 29, 2025. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)After the Senate voted to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary, supporters of his “Make America Healthy Again” movement cheered at having a champion in the federal government.
Now the grumbling has begun. Some of Kennedy’s allies say he’s become almost inaccessible since his confirmation and complain that he’s made glacial progress advancing MAHA goals, such as halting mRNA-based COVID shots and removing fluoride from drinking water.
The fractures underscore the clash between Kennedy’s movement and President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agenda. Kennedy is pulled between his supporters who want swift action to disrupt traditional health care and Trump, who is focused more on tariffs and increasing deportations than on disease, according to four people close to Kennedy who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Many of the priorities driving Kennedy’s MAHA program are not top priorities of his boss.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Kennedy’s capacity to navigate those tensions has been further strained by a measles outbreak and the threat of a bird flu pandemic, the people said.
Some of his deputies are still being vetted and other key positions remain unfilled. That, along with resignations of top HHS leaders and sweeping staffing reductions, has created a gap in expertise. Kennedy sometimes calls close informal advisers on the run before meetings, and the crises have put him in a reactionary stance, working on weekends and marshaling staff for Sunday meetings, according to the people.
More churn is coming because of an HHS reorganization set to eliminate about 20,000 jobs, including a 19% cut to the workforce at the FDA, which oversees food, nutrition, and vaccines.
HHS spokespeople didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.
To be sure, Kennedy’s ascendance represents a breakthrough for the MAHA movement, a broad collection of gadflies, groups, and wellness influencers who extol raw milk, metabolic health, and sustainable farming while lambasting Big Pharma, vaccines, and processed foods.
The coming months will test Kennedy’s ability to juggle the challenges and achieve Trump’s goals without losing the support of MAHA adherents, especially special interest and advocacy groups that helped him reach his influential perch overseeing one of the nation’s largest federal agencies. HHS, with a budget of almost $2 trillion, includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
But the MAHA goals aren’t top agenda items for GOP voters, who tend to be focused more on the price of eggs than whether they’re organic.
The MAHA faithful “expect action” but their to-do list is not necessarily a high priority for voters or lawmakers, said Robert Blendon, a professor emeritus of health policy and political analysis at Harvard. “And should there be a big measles outbreak or avian flu, it would hurt the White House if there was a big conflict over vaccines going on,” he said.
An additional challenge for Kennedy is that not all MAHA and MAGA goals overlap. Trump wants to slash the workforce, which Kennedy has embraced. But fulfilling MAHA wishes will require more regulation, which runs counter to MAGA dogma favoring a smaller federal government.
MAHA wants fluoride out of water because followers say it leads to lower IQ levels in children, as well as arthritis and bone cancer. Kennedy said on X that fluoride is dangerous and that the Trump administration would recommend it be removed from America’s drinking water. Fluoridated water is credited for vastly reducing rates of tooth decay in the U.S. In 2015, the CDC called water fluoridation one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century, and only 15% of Americans think fluoride is harmful or detrimental to the public, based on a poll in January by market research company Ipsos.

MAHA adherents believe in the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, and Kennedy just tapped a vaccine opponent to work on a study on possible connections. In fact, HHS has launched an effort that Kennedy said will determine by September what has caused the “autism epidemic.” Many autism researchers say this timeline sows doubts about the study’s seriousness. Most voters support vaccines and believe in their benefits. Eight in 10 parents with children under age 18 say they normally keep them up to date with recommended childhood vaccines, according to a KFF poll in January.
And MAHA wants to replace seed oils, which the movement’s followers claim without evidence are unhealthy, with animal fats such as beef tallow, which is high in saturated fat, which can contribute to high cholesterol and heart disease. Only 13% of Americans believe seed oils are unhealthy to consume, based on a poll by the industry-backed International Food Information Council.
Perhaps no goal is more important to many MAHA followers, however, than banning the mRNA technology behind covid vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer.
“The big threat is that we still have covid-19 vaccines on the market,” said Peter McCullough, a former cardiologist who has been criticized for spreading covid misinformation and has informally advised Kennedy. “It’s horrendous. I would not hesitate; I would just pull it. What’s he waiting for?”
The FDA says COVID shots are safe. They are credited for saving millions of lives worldwide during the pandemic, and two NIH-funded scientists who advanced mRNA technology were awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2023.
Yanking authority for mRNA-based covid vaccines could backfire because Trump sees “Operation Warp Speed,” the federal effort to develop the shots, as one of his signature achievements, according to one of the people close to Kennedy. And it would have been impolitic to take action before the confirmation of an FDA commissioner, the person said. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins University researcher, was confirmed on March 25 to the post.
Kennedy also isn’t calling all the shots. He was initially unaware of the appointment of Gerald Parker, a veterinarian who recently chaired an NIH advisory board, to head the White House’s pandemic office, according to one of the people.
Kennedy did choose Susan Monarez, a former deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, as acting CDC director. Trump nominated her for Senate confirmation to lead the agency on March 24. Kennedy felt she had worked well with Trump’s job-cutting Department of Government Efficiency and did a great job in her acting director position, one of the people close to him said.
Kennedy is also in a difficult position regarding Trump’s Make America Healthy Again commission, which Kennedy chairs. The panel’s charge to investigate and deliver an action plan on the nation’s decades-long increase in chronic illness, with a special emphasis on children, is a clear pitch to the MAHA movement. But Trump has told Kennedy, according to one of the people, that he wants to see measurable progress in a year to 18 months — which is hard both to define and to achieve.
While Kennedy is a scion of the country’s most famous Democratic family, he is widely distrusted in the medical community because of his fringe views on vaccines and his rejection of established science. Since taking office, he has tried to cultivate relationships with MAGA-leaning state officials, including West Virginia’s governor, Republican Patrick Morrisey. And his alliance with Trump is new. When Kennedy was running for president in 2024, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to say, “Kennedy is a Radical Left Democrat, and always will be!!!” — though Trump’s administration includes other onetime adversaries such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Many of Kennedy’s nutrition and health goals would require regulation, which clash with Trump’s anti-regulatory agenda and his focus on a lean federal government.
Meanwhile, he’s relied on his principal deputy chief of staff, Stefanie Spear, a longtime Kennedy aide who has taken on the role of traffic cop in the department. He’s also leaned on HHS chief of staff Heather Flick Melanson for expertise. She was a senior adviser to former HHS Secretary Alex Azar in Trump’s first term.
Kennedy’s close circle of informal advisers includes nontraditional doctors, fellow vaccine opponents, media personalities, and self-appointed health gurus. Some have gained unprecedented influence and access to the innermost workings of federal health agencies.
Calley Means, for example, is a Kennedy ally whose business sells wellness products such as saunas and supplements. His statements have dismayed some scientists, such as when he called covid vaccine mandates for children a “war crime” and said without evidence that “metabolically healthy” people don’t die from covid. In March, Means joined the White House as a special government employee and MAHA adviser.
Others in Kennedy’s orbit include Del Bigtree, a television producer who founded the anti-vaccination group Informed Consent Action Network, and some officials from the previous Trump administration. Aaron Siri, a lawyer for Kennedy, is no longer involved in vetting candidates for HHS positions, one of the people said.
“‘Nontraditional’ as a description for these people is not enough. We’re talking about beyond the outer fringes of medicine,” said Irwin Redlener, senior adviser for the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, of Kennedy’s inner circle. “This faux expertise is really dangerous.”
Even as some MAHA adherents press for swifter action, Kennedy’s recent comments and actions suggest public health ideas once dismissed as fringe or unscientific now have an advocate at HHS.
Kennedy claimed without evidence that cod liver oil is an effective treatment for measles. He’s suggested letting the bird flu virus rip unchecked through infected chicken flocks even though scientists say that could unleash dangerous mutations.
And he’s backed cellphone bans in schools, saying phones cause cancer in kids. Most studies have found no such link.

Matthew Ariwoola, 32, was a fourth-year doctoral chemistry student at USC, scheduled to graduate in December. But on April 8, USC staff informed Ariwoola he could not continue studying and teaching due to a change in his immigration status.
U.S. District Judge Jacquelyn Austin granted a temporary order late Friday to prevent Ariwoola’s detention or deportation while the case makes its way through the court system.
In the order, which applies for two weeks, the judge wrote the government should not stop Ariwoola from “continuing to pursue his academic and employment pursuits that he is authorized to pursue.”
Ariwoola is one in a wave of more than 1,000 international students at colleges nationwide suddenly facing the possibility of arrest and deportation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the Trump administration terminated their student visas.
In South Carolina, at least a dozen USC students, a pair of Furman University students, and some students at Clemson University have had their student visas revoked or records terminated without warning, according to Allen Chaney, the legal director of the ACLU of South Carolina who is representing Ariwoola. (Chaney said those are the students his organization knows about; there could be more.)
“Matthew is yet another victim of the Trump administration’s haphazard and flagrantly unconstitutional dragnet of our international students,” Chaney said. “It’s hard to see how ejecting a hardworking and law-abiding doctoral student is anything but the product of an unmasked hatred of non-Americans. No one is better off if Matthew is deported, no one.”
U.S. Senate GOP wants mass deportations to ‘start early’ next year, Graham says

International students enter the United States most commonly through the F-1 student visa program and are monitored through a federal database, known as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).
Once a student is granted a visa and residency status, they can typically stay in the U.S. even if that visa expires as long as they remain enrolled full time in school and aren’t convicted of a violent crime. There are also restrictions on off-campus jobs they’re authorized to take.
Ariwoola was researching ways to make medications more effective and teaching four chemistry courses at USC. He had been supporting his family through the stipend he receives from the university. Now he won’t be able to pay rent and could end up homeless, the ACLU of SC wrote.
Chaney said the federal immigration agency gave his client no warning that it intended to terminate his record.
The only reason listed in the federal database: “OTHER – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.”
“There’s no process, no notice, they’re just shipping them straight to termination,” Chaney said.
Ariwoola has never been convicted of a crime.
Police arrested him in 2023 on a warrant out of Georgia for alleged “theft by deception,” a crime which can involve the use of in-person or cyber scams to steal from a victim. But according to the ACLU, Ariwoola had never contacted the accuser and the prosecutor had dismissed all charges.
Historically, students whose visas were revoked or expired have not lost their legal residency status and could stay in the U.S. to finish school. It only prevented their leaving the U.S. and returning without reapplying.
In a similar case in Michigan involving four students from the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, lawyers from the government leaned into this, arguing in court documents filed this week that “terminating a record within SEVIS does not effectuate a visa revocation” because students can apply to have their status reinstated.
But immigration lawyers have questioned why Homeland Security terminated the records at all if it did not intend to revoke the students’ legal status.

Chaney also said applying for reinstatement involves a new set of arguments and assumes the student’s records were rightfully terminated in the first place.
“If ICE believes a student is deportable, it has the authority to initiate removal proceedings and make its case,” the ACLU of South Carolina wrote in court documents. “It cannot, however, misuse SEVIS to circumvent the law, strip students of status, and bully them into self-deporting without any process of law.”
The ACLU also argued in court documents that universities themselves could lose the ability to host any current or future international students if they fail to comply with federal regulations by allowing a student with a revoked status continue to attend.
This creates a self fulfilling prophesy, leading to visa revocation if a student can’t remain enrolled.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SC25-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-19 06:03:08.463442

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Nearly every country in the world has a central bank — a public institution that manages a country’s currency and its monetary policy. And these banks have an extraordinary amount of power. By controlling the flow of money and credit in a country, they can affect economic growth, inflation, employment and financial stability.
These are powers that many politicians — including, currently, U.S. President Donald Trump — would seemingly like to control or at least manipulate. That’s because monetary policy can provide governments with economic boosts at key times, such as around elections or during periods of falling popularity.
The problem is that short-lived, politically motivated moves may be detrimental to the long-term economic well-being of a nation. They may, in other words, saddle the economy with problems further down the line.
That is why central banks across the globe tend to receive significant leeway to set interest rates independently and free from the electoral wishes of politicians.
In fact, monetary policymaking that is data-driven and technocratic, rather than politically motivated, has since the early 1990s been seen as the gold standard of governance of national finances. By and large, this arrangement, in which central bankers keep politicians at arm’s length, has achieved its main purpose: Inflation has been relatively low and stable in countries with independent central banks, such as Switzerland or Sweden — certainly until the pandemic and war in Europe began pushing up prices globally.
In comparison, countries such as Lebanon and Egypt, where independence was never extended, or Argentina and Turkey, where it has been curtailed, have experienced more bouts of high inflation.
But despite independence being seen to work, central banks over the past decade have come under increased pressure from politicians. They hope to keep interest rates low and reap voter gratitude for a humming economy and cheap loans.
Trump is one recent example. In his first term as president, he criticized his own choice to head the U.S. Federal Reserve and demanded lower interest rates. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that tariffs are “highly likely” to trigger inflation, Trump lashed out on April 17, 2025, in an online post in which he accused Powell of being “TOO LATE AND WRONG” on interest rate cuts, while suggesting that the central banker’s “termination cannot come fast enough!”
As political economists, we are not surprised to see politicians try to exert influence on central banks. Monetary policy, even with independence, has always been political. For one thing, central banks remain part of the government bureaucracy, and independence granted to them can always be reversed — either by changing laws or backtracking on established practices.
Moreover, the reason politicians may want to interfere in monetary policy is that low interest rates remain a potent, quick method to boost an economy. And while politicians know that there are costs to besieging an independent central bank — financial markets may react negatively or inflation may flare up — short-term control of a powerful policy tool can prove irresistible.
 
Legislating independence
If monetary policy is such a coveted policy tool, how have central banks held off politicians and stayed independent? And is this independence being eroded?
Broadly, central banks are protected by laws that offer long tenures to their leadership, allow them to focus policy primarily on inflation, and severely limit lending to the rest of the government.
Of course, such legislation cannot anticipate all future contingencies, which may open the door for political interference or for practices that break the law. And sometimes central bankers are unceremoniously fired.
However, laws do keep politicians in line. For example, even in authoritarian countries, laws protecting central banks from political interference have helped reduce inflation and restricted central bank lending to the government.
In our own research, we have detailed the ways that laws have insulated central banks from the rest of the government, but also the recent trend of eroding this legal independence.
 
Politicizing appointees
Around the world, appointments to central bank leadership are political — elected politicians select candidates based on career credentials, political affiliation and, importantly, their dislike or tolerance of inflation.
But lawmakers in different countries exercise different degrees of political control.
A 2025 study shows that the large majority of central bank leaders — about 70% — are appointed by the head of government alone or with the intervention of other members of the executive branch. This ensures that the preferences of the central bank are closer to the government’s, which can boost the central bank’s legitimacy in democratic countries, but at the risk of permeability to political influence.
Alternatively, appointments can involve the legislative power or even the central bank’s own board. In the U.S., while the president nominates members of the Federal Reserve Board, the Senate can and has rejected unconventional or incompetent candidates.
Moreover, even if appointments are political, many central bankers stay in office long after the people who appointed them have been voted out. By the end of 2023, the most common length of the governors’ appointment is five years, and in 41 countries the legal mandate was six years or longer. Powell is set to stay on as Fed chair until his term expires in 2026. The Fed chair position has traditionally been protected by law, as Powell himself acknowledged in November 2024: “We’re not removable except for cause. We serve very long terms, seemingly endless terms. So we’re protected into law. Congress could change that law, but I don’t think there’s any danger of that.” But Trump’s firing of leaders of other independent federal agencies has set up a legal challenge that could affect the Fed, too.
In the 2000s, several countries shortened the tenure of their central banks’ governors to four or five years. Sometimes, this was part of broader restrictions in central bank independence, as was the case in Iceland in 2001, Ghana in 2002 and Romania in 2004.
 
The low inflation objective
As of 2023, all but six central banks globally had low inflation as their main goal. Yet many central banks are required by law to try to achieve additional and sometimes conflicting goals, such as financial stability, full employment or support for the government’s policies.
This is the case for 38 central banks that either have the explicit dual mandate of price stability and employment or more complex goals. In Argentina, for example, the central bank’s mandate is to provide “employment and economic development with social equity.”


Conflicting objectives can open central banks to politicization. In the U.S. the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. These goals are often complementary, and economists have argued that low inflation is a prerequisite for sustainable high levels of employment.
But in times of overlapping high inflation and high unemployment, such as in the late 1970s or when the COVID-19 crisis was winding down in 2022, the Fed’s dual mandate has become active territory for political wrangling.
Since 2000, at least 23 countries have expanded the focus of their central banks beyond just inflation.
 
Limits on government lending
The first central banks were created to help secure finance for governments fighting wars. But today, limiting lending to governments is at the core of protecting price stability from unsustainable fiscal spending.
History is dotted with the consequences of not doing so. In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, central banks in Latin America printed money to support their governments’ spending goals. But it resulted in massive inflation while not securing growth or political stability.
Today, limits on lending are strongly associated with lower inflation in the developing world. And central banks with high levels of independence can reject a government’s financing requests or dictate the terms of loans.
Yet over the past two decades, almost 40 countries have made their central banks less able to limit central government funding. In the more extreme examples — such as in Belarus, Ecuador or even New Zealand — they have turned the central bank into a potential financier for the government.
 
Scapegoating central bankers
In recent years, governments have tried to influence central banks by pushing for lower interest rates, making statements criticizing bank policy or calling for meetings with central bank leadership.
At the same time, politicians have blamed the same central bankers for a number of perceived failings: not anticipating economic shocks such as the 2007-09 financial crisis; exceeding their authority with quantitative easing; or creating massive inequality or instability while trying to save the financial sector.
And since mid-2021, major central banks have struggled to keep inflation low, raising questions from populist and antidemocratic politicians about the merits of an arm’s-length relationship.
But chipping away at central bank independence, as Trump appears to be doing with his open criticism of the Fed chair and implicit threats of dismissal, is a historically sure way to high inflation.

Garmatz U.S. Courthouse in Baltimore. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Education argued Friday that the department’s “Dear Colleague” letter criticizing some diversity, equity and inclusion practices was merely a reminder to schools that existing civil rights law protects white children from discrimination just as much as children from a minority group.
But to opponents, the letter represents a significant change in policy, which compels teachers to restrain their speech about diversity for fear that their schools could lose access to critical federal funding.
The arguments were part of wide-ranging hearing in U.S. District Court for Maryland over a lawsuit by the American Federation of Teachers, its Maryland chapter and the American Sociological Association seeking to block enforcement of the Feb. 14 letter, which says schools that do not comply with civil rights law “face potential loss of federal funding.”
“The government is saying, with its power of the purse: ‘We don’t like diversity, equity and inclusion,’” said Brooke Menschel, a senior attorney at Democracy Forward, who was representing the plaintiffs.
U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher did not rule Friday on the request for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the government from enforcing its “Dear Colleague” letter, but said she plans to issue a written ruling in the days ahead. A similar case is unfolding in New Hampshire, where a federal judge heard arguments Thursday from the government, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association. That judge is also yet to rule.
On Friday, Gallagher peppered each side with questions on a number of grounds. Did teachers have standing to challenge rules directed at school districts and states? What type of action exactly did the letter constitute? And therefore, what procedural rules did the government have to follow in order to issue it?
At one point, Gallagher probed about how the “Dear Colleague” letter may be enforced, asking whether a school could come under investigation simply because one student reported feeling troubled by classroom discussions about the historical actions of a particular racial group.
“Some people are more sensitive to discussions in a classroom setting than others,” Gallagher said. “Where does that line get drawn?”
Brown joins another lawsuit against Trump administration, taking on Education Department

Abhishek Kambli, a Justice Department attorney, said the letter was not meant to police such classroom discussions. It was meant to address situations in which students are classified based on race, he said. He highlighted “privilege walks,” wherein participants are categorized based on advantages and disadvantages they’ve faced because of their backgrounds.
He argued that the Civil Rights Act already disallows such activities because they are discriminatory, even though the discrimination may victimize students who comprise a majority group rather than a minority.
“It’s highly unlikely that they’re going to go after a school because they taught a certain book,” Kambli said. “All this letter does is just clarify what the existing obligations are under Title VI [of the Civil Rights Act].”
“They’re trying to make the letter into something that it’s not,” Kambli said of plaintiffs.
But Menschel said that the department, through the letter, was “putting its thumb on the scale of a particular perspective,” causing reasonable teachers to fear reprisal because of particular classroom lessons, and thereby creating a chilling effect on school speech.
One passage in the letter says that “educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices.” Menschel also pointed to the department’s creation of an online portal titled “End DEI,” through which community members can report instances of discrimination.
“The name of the portal itself points to exactly their perspective, and they are trying very hard to coerce people into sharing their views — and doing so under threat of withholding funds,” Menschel said.
But Kambli argued the portal’s name was just evidence that the department has a new priority in enforcing existing civil rights law: Rooting out discrimination occurring under the guise of “DEI.”
“It is perfectly allowable for the government to have a portal that’s aimed at that particular enforcement priority,” Kambli said.
A portion of Friday’s hearing focused on whether the teachers’ groups and the American Sociological Association had legal standing to file suit and seek a preliminary injunction.
Kambli argued that the Department of Education does not directly regulate individual teachers or school administrators, but rather school districts. The teachers would have to show that they sustained a direct harm from the Feb. 14 letter in order to have standing in court, he said.
But the department has yet to open an investigation focused on something like classroom speech, Kambli said, so the educators’ fears are only hypothetical in nature.
“If they’re censoring based off of something that the DCL [Dear Colleague letter] does not say is disallowed, then that harm is self-inflicted,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In March, the department announced that it had opened investigations into dozens of colleges and universities stemming from the Dear Colleague Letter. A department news release said 45 of the schools came under investigation because they were participating in “The Ph.D Project,” which the release called “an organization that purports to provide doctoral students with insights into obtaining a Ph.D. and networking opportunities, but limits eligibility based on the race of participants.”
Six schools came under investigation for “allegedly awarding impermissible race-based scholarships,” and one is being investigated for “allegedly administering a program that segregates students on the basis of race.”
Although none of those investigations focus on classroom speech in particular, Menschel said they provide a “relevant and important backdrop” for assessing teachers’ concerns that their own classroom conversations about diversity could result in their schools being penalized by the department.
To combat claims that the issuance of the Feb. 14 letter may have violated procedural rules, including by not offering an opportunity for public comment before implementation, Kambli argued that the department only issued the letter as a courtesy to schools. The department could have started investigating instances if considered problematic applications of DEI under existing law, he said.
“We didn’t have to provide any of this anyway,” Kambli said. “We did that to put the schools on as much notice as possible.”
But, Menschel asked, if the Dear Colleague letter didn’t represent a change in policy, why did the department pull “hundreds of pages” of prior civil rights guidance documents from its public-facing website?
Kambli argued that new presidential administrations are allowed to rescind Dear Colleague letters from prior administrations, calling it a “common practice.”
Menschel also said the department’s requirement that school systems certify their compliance with the letter indicates that it is a policy change. The plaintiffs asked\ Gallagher to pause enforcement of the letter as well as the certification requirement.
Gallagher said the latter request gave her pause, because the certification process was not mentioned in the plaintiffs’ original complaint, which focused entirely on the letter because the certification process had yet to be issued by the department.
“I’m struggling with the fact that I am being asked to enter a preliminary injunction with something that is not mentioned anywhere in the complaint,” Gallagher said.
But Menschel pushed back, arguing that the certification process is a continuation of the letter itself.
“The department is just recycling the letter, in a way, and taking another step toward implementation,” Menschel said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-1024x860.jpg,,,2025-04-19 05:00:42.067631

(Photo by Petty Officer 1st Class Luke Pinneo/U.S. Coast Guard)Officials at the state Department of Information Technology pushed back on a new audit that raises questions about how much progress has been made on issues found in earlier reviews.
The new report updates a 2024 review that cited more than a dozen concerns, including some redacted cybersecurity issues, at the department. While some progress had been made on those issues, auditors said the department “had not resolved some or all of the recommendations” from the earlier report.
But agency officials said they had fully implemented corrective action on four and were working on others. When auditors disagreed, Acting DoIT Secretary Melissa Leaman wrote in a response letter that “there are many factual inaccuracies in the draft report that we hope are addressed prior to OLA finalizing the report.”
It is common for auditors to share a draft copy of a report with department heads so that they can respond before an audit is released to the public.
The audit team said it stands by the accuracy of its report.
“DoIT’s response notes pervasive disagreement with our conclusions and several assertions that our comments were factually inaccurate,” Legislative Auditor Brian S. Tanen, wrote in the audit. “We reviewed DoIT’s responses and stand by the facts presented … which were factually accurate based upon documentation DoIT was able to provide during our fieldwork.”
The tug-of-war comes as lawmakers in Annapolis have taken a renewed interest in DoIT, following audits and concerns that the agency is not properly overseeing major and expensive technology projects. One top lawmaker characterized the agency’s efforts as a money pit.
The March 25 review by the Office of Legislative Audits looked at November 2024 to January 2025 and found that the department “had not resolved some or all of the recommendations in the 10 non-cybersecurity related findings” in a March 2024  report, that “concluded that DoIT’s accountability and compliance rating was unsatisfactory.”
The latest review showed many the earlier recommendations still unresolved, Tanen wrote in a letter to the legislative Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee.
DoIT claimed it had corrected concerns with ensuring major projects remained on time and on budget, evaluating outside project managers hired by contractors, and providing support documentation for costs in annual reports sent to the governor and legislature.
Auditors, in the most recent review, disagreed saying the efforts were “in progress.”
In another instance, auditors raised concerns about $25 million in cybersecurity remediation work orders. The auditor said the department had not done enough to ensure that nearly $12 million in work invoiced by the vendor related to those work orders.
The department reported to auditors that the issue had been corrected. Auditors, in their report, said corrective efforts were “in progress.”
The department also did not provide any updates on a nearly $589 million technology project called MDThink. Auditors said the recommendations from an earlier audit were not fully implemented.
The department has become a source of frustration for some lawmakers, including Sens. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) and Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore).
Both lawmakers said the agency’s “lack of clarity, authority and management and oversight really has led to poor project management, cost overruns and failures.”
One of those failures, according to Hester, was an 80% cost overrun on the MDThink project proposed by Gov. Larry Hogan (R). The senator called the resulting $588 million cost “pretty sad.”
Hester and Hershey sponsored a bill this year imposing more oversight over the agency.
The department also caught the attention of Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard). He called the agency “a mess.” He added money for IT projects has been “going down a hole in many ways and in many projects. And it’s really a shame.”
The chair at the time vowed that the situation “has got to get handled, and it’s going to get handled.”
The General Assembly passed identical bills — House Bill 738 and Senate Bill 705 — aimed at refocusing the department on major projects and ensuring compliance with recommendations from the auditor. The bill now awaits action by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
Hester and Del. Anne Kaiser (D-Montgomery), sponsor of the House bill, are co-chairs of the Joint Committee on Cybersecurity and Information Technology.
The legislation as passed imposes new oversight and reporting requirements.
A key part of the bill expands and defines the responsibilities of the department secretary on oversight of major IT projects. The bill also prohibits contracting for IT services or products that are not consistent with its master plan.
The secretary must also meet quarterly with the chief information officer of agencies or departments with planned or ongoing IT projects.
It also sets up an expert panel to advise the legislature on IT issues and requires the Senate Budget and Taxation and House Health and Government Operations committees to convene a work group to evaluate the bill and other potential changes. The work group will also determine if other actions are needed to resolve issues raised by the auditor.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1126510-newsletter-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-04-19 05:00:42.067631

Just one set of tariffs, announced by President Donald Trump on April 2 — what he called “Liberation Day” — will cost the average American household about $2,100. If all of his proposed tariffs for 2025 go into effect? That number jumps to $3,800.
Pain is real
Nebraskans certainly didn’t vote in 2024 to have nearly four grand pulled out of our pockets.
The concern about costs isn’t a Republican issue or a Democrat issue: It’s an everybody issue.
Poll after poll shows the majority of voters are worried about prices. Even Trump’s own pollster found cost of living is the top concern for his supporters and swing voters. Nebraskans voted for policies that would ease inflation and let us keep more of what we earn. What we’ve gotten instead is the opposite.
The tariff-heavy approach doesn’t reflect the message many sent at the ballot box.
Inflation is already projected to go over 4% this year, and after the April tariff news, the stock market had its worst week since the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumer confidence has been dropping every month in 2025. It’s now the lowest it’s been since late 2022.
The hit to Nebraskans’ wallets is only part of the story. New tariffs are also hurting the backbone of Nebraska’s economy: agriculture.
We’re the Cornhusker State for a reason. Our corn production brings in more than $8 billion each year. But now our top export is at risk. In 2024, more than 90% of Nebraska’s corn exports went to Canada, Mexico and China, the countries being hit the hardest by these tariffs.
Agriculture always pays
This isn’t a new kind of pain for Nebraska’s farmers. Back in 2019, the Nebraska Farm Bureau said tariffs cost us $1 billion. That’s a tough pill to swallow, but for many farmers, it’s just more of the same.
Paul Krueger, a corn and soybean farmer from Bladen said it best: “Any time our country gets involved with any sort of tariffs that affect the agriculture industry, every farmer just kind of groans about that. We’re powerless to do anything except take what comes out in the wash.”
He’s right. And it’s not just farmers. It’s business owners across Nebraska who feel forgotten. While tariffs grab the spotlight, other policies that could actually help drive down costs are being pushed aside.
Take the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which would extend tax cuts that spurred the economy during the president’s first term. This key legislation still hasn’t been extended. Policies that would cut red tape to empower small businesses are also on the backburner. Crucial industries like manufacturing, which is huge for our state, seem to be being ignored.
Tariffs can have a purpose. But the way they’re being used right now doesn’t match what voters asked for. Even some of President Trump’s former advisors have said we should’ve gone with tax cuts before tariffs.
It’s not too late
That said, it’s not too late. There’s still time to put working families first, to make the economy more affordable and to follow through on the promises that got officials elected.
Nebraska’s own U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., is moving in the right direction. He introduced a bill in Congress to give more say back to Congress on trade policy. He put it simply: “The Constitution is clear … Congress has the power of tariffs and taxes and we gave some of that power to the executive branch. … In hindsight, that was a mistake.”
It’s that kind of thinking we need. It shows he’s looking out for Nebraska families, farmers and workers who just want relief from rising costs.
We don’t need more economic strain. Nebraskans voted for lower prices and a better standard of living.
It’s time for our leaders to deliver.
