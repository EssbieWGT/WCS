(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — While Byron Donalds hasn’t received the backing of Gov. Ron DeSantis in his quest to succeed him as governor of Florida next year, the U.S. House member from Naples has no problem showering the love on the state’s chief executive.
“We have the best governor in America right now,” Donalds said Saturday during a campaign appearance in Tampa. “I don’t play political games. He’s the best. We have to build on what he has done and take our state to a whole ‘nother level.”
Donalds, the Trump-endorsed early frontrunner for the Republican nomination for governor next year, got deep into policy prescriptions while addressing a crowd of at least 150 people who gathered at La Teresita, a Cuban eatery in the city’s Hispanic district.
The candidate spent nearly half of his hour-long visit answering questions submitted in advance by members of the audience.
The property tax issue
One such query asked whether he would support a proposal on the 2026 November ballot to eliminate or substantially reduce property taxes “without all the legal jargon where one can understand in simple terms what they’re voting for?”
“That second part is going to be really hard,” Donalds immediately responded.
“Would I love to eliminate property taxes? Yes,” he said. However: “If we eliminate property taxes in the state of Florida, we’d have to double the sales tax.”
He went on to say that doubling the 6% sales tax statewide would lead to a decrease in tourism from working people and thus isn’t a real option (the co-chair of the select committee in the Florida House studying the issue has already said that the total elimination of property taxes is a non-starter).
Instead, Donalds offered a couple of remedies — included raising the homestead exemption from $50,000 to between $300,000 and $400,000.
“So, you do that on homesteaded property, and then you create a harder cap that would have to apply for the school taxes,” he said. “Because Save Our Homes and all the other homesteaded exemptions do not apply to school districts. They only apply to the cities and the counties. … It has to apply to [school] districts as well to see a real decrease in property taxes.”
Another suggestion he made was that the millage rate assessed by local governments should instead be set by the county tax collector.
And he said that if elected he would continue the DOGE efforts enacted by Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia. “Everybody’s budget is going to be examined. Every year. All the time. Not just local. But state as well.”
He called the idea of property tax reform a step in the right direction, ultimately, “because at the end of the day, we can’t have people being priced out of their homes. We can’t have it. I don’t care what project you got going on in your local government. If you’re pricing people out, then guess what? That’s a bad project. You need to go back to the drawing board.”
He’s no longer all about charter schools
Donalds, who served in the Legislature from 2016-2020 before moving on to Congress, said he’s evolved in his thinking on one form of education policy.
“When I first got to the Legislature, I used to think that charter schools were the only thing that could change education, and I thought it was ‘all charters, all the time,’” he said.
And now?
“I’ve gotten off of that,” he said. “I’m agnostic when it comes to schools. In terms of which schools are allowed and which schools are not. That’s one of the reasons why I am such a vehement supporter and believer in parental empowerment and true school choice.”
He said state educators need to start looking at so-called “co-locational schools” as a remedy for school districts suddenly populated with fewer students but the same number of physical buildings.
“If there’s a fledgling charter school, a fledgling private school, or a fledgling parochial religious school and they’re trying to get started and parents are choosing them, why is the school district having a building that’s half empty? Co-locate the schools. Allow those fledgling schools to come up.”
And he said it’s time to figure out how to build nonpublic school infrastructure, an idea he acknowledges is “outside the box.”
“If our parents are choosing nonpublic options, and we fund education because we believe that funding education is in the interest of the state and the future of the state, then we are going to have to look at solutions for nonpublic schools,” he said. “I think you can do it in a way that the taxpayer actually gets a semblance of a return and they’re not left holding the bag. So there’s a way to be able to deliver that.”
Another idea? Microschools, which has been described by EdChoice as a reimagining of the one-room schoolhouse, with small class sizes and curricula tailored to fit the needs of each class.
“Parents are saying, ‘You know what, we’re going to do a microschool. I think we should be open to all of that,” he said.  Florida lawmakers passed a bill (HB 1285) in the 2024 session that opened more options for school locations in the state. The measure allows private charter and microschools to rent or buy spaces like churches, libraries, community centers, theaters, or museums in the state to operate in.
One proposal that Donalds doesn’t appear to be on the same wavelength with Gov. DeSantis is to ban all vaccine mandates in Florida.
“We’re going to look at all the things that are rulemaking, not statutory,” he told the Phoenix as he exited the stage. “Stuff that’s statutory like mRNA vaccines? Probably not going to touch that.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-9-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-09-20 17:57:13.137512

Newsom signed laws meant to protect immigrants during President Trump's extensive deportation program. Some of the measures raise constitutional questions and likely will be challenged.,"In summary
Gov. Newsom signed laws meant to protect immigrants during President Trump’s extensive deportation program. Some of the measures raise constitutional questions and likely will be challenged.


Gov. Gavin Newsom today signed a set of bills meant to check the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown in California, including a first-in-the nation measure to prohibit officers from wearing masks and others that limit their access to schools and hospitals. 
The new laws echo the “resistance” measures California adopted during the first administration, when it passed a so-called sanctuary law to limit local law enforcement from cooperating with immigration agents, among other policies. 
“Immigrants have rights and we have the right to stand up and push back,” Newsom said at an event in Los Angeles where he signed the legislation.
President Trump promised a historic deportation effort and assault on sanctuary-style policies when he took office for the second time. His administration criticized the state’s new immigration laws even before Newsom signed them. 
The Department of Homeland Security earlier this week called on Newsom to veto the mask bill — one of the more contentious pieces of immigration legislation — calling it “despicable.” 
“Once again sanctuary politicians are trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a Sept. 16 press release.
California may struggle to enforce the new laws, some of which have already raised constitutional questions around the state’s role in federal operations, but lawmakers maintain that they are legally defensible. 
California political consultant Mike Madrid said in signing the laws Newsom is showing that he can stand up and fight, whether or not he has a chance of winning. 
“In this moment, when there are very few cards to play for state governments and state legislatures, California has done what no other state has done: establish itself as the tip of the spear on resisting a lot of these efforts that are an affront to its values,” said Madrid, a longtime Republican consultant who co-founded the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. 
“99% of this is the purview of the federal government. So a lot of it is just symbolic, but symbolism matters. It’s both politically astute but also morally right,” he said. 
The package of bills Newsom signed included:

Assembly Bill 49 prohibits schools from allowing immigration enforcement officers on campus without a warrant.
Senate Bill 627 widely prohibits federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties. 
Senate Bill 805 requires that law enforcement officers identify themselves while conducting their duties, with some exceptions. 
Senate Bill 81 prohibits immigration enforcement from entering restricted areas of a health facility without a judicial warrant or court order. 
Senate Bill 98 requires schools and higher education institutions to send community notifications when immigration enforcement is on campus, and prohibits immigration enforcement from entering certain areas without a judicial warrant or court order.

California Democrats began drafting immigration-related bills almost as soon Trump took office in January. Those efforts accelerated after the Trump administration launched aggressive immigration sweeps throughout Los Angeles, which led to weeks of protests and a subsequent National Guard deployment.
“All of this legislative resistance is to protect Angelenos from their own federal government. That is profound,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said at a news conference with Newsom and other Democratic leaders.
Will the laws make a difference?
Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said the legislation may have a marginal impact on federal immigration enforcement operations.
In 2018, for instance, California passed a law to restrict immigration arrests at superior court buildings. That hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from detaining people at those courts this year.
“The federal government is going to continue doing what it’s doing, in one form or another,” he said. “I do think the legislation gives some hope and optimism to communities that feel under fire, vulnerable and basically hated by the federal government.”
Shiu-Ming Cheer, deputy director at California Immigrant Policy Center, remains hopeful that the package of bills will ensure safety for people attending school and accessing health care.
“With most laws, there has to be really vigorous monitoring, both by the state as well as by advocates to ensure that it’s truly being implemented and followed,” she said. 
California police opposed mask ban
The most controversial bill in the package was Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener’s proposal to widely ban federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties. The law, also known as the “No Secret Police Act,” does not apply to certain forms of face coverings, such as face shields, and it exempts some officers, including those who are undercover. Officers who violate the law will face an infraction or misdemeanor.
Wiener and Democratic Sens. Jesse Arreguín, Sasha Pérez and Aisha Wahab championed the legislation after seeing footage of masked and unidentifiable agents carrying out operations.
“ICE’s recklessness creates chaos as agents run around with what are effectively ski masks and no identification, grabbing people, throwing them in unmarked vehicles, and disappearing them,” Wiener of San Francisco said at a legislative hearing in August. “When law enforcement officers hide their identities, it destroys community trust.”

California’s law enforcement groups widely opposed the bill, arguing it will largely apply to local police, rather than federal agents, because the federal government is likely to sue on constitutional grounds. 
“It’s using an emotionally charged issue on a federal level to pass a bill that will only affect local peace officers,” said Brian Marvel, president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, an umbrella labor organization that lobbies on behalf of police unions. “You’re upset with the feds, but you’re going to punish us.”
Other law enforcement experts echoed those concerns, arguing that it’s illegal to interfere with federal operations. 
“California cops are not going to enforce this law,” said Ed Obayashi, a longtime California police officer who now is a special prosecutor and policy adviser to the Modoc County Sheriff’s Office. “You cannot regulate lawful federal conduct, whether the Legislature likes it or not.” 
The law allows officers to be sued personally for “tortious conduct,” including if they assault or falsely arrest someone while masked. 
“Private enforcement could be the avenue where enforcement is the likeliest,” said Johnson.
The bill caused hours of contentious debate on the Senate and Assembly floors, with many Republicans calling it misguided. 
“My immigrant family is not afraid” of ramped-up immigration enforcement, Fresno Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa said, “because we did not break the law.”
But Democrats were animated because just days before, the U.S. Supreme Court had sided with the Trump administration and ICE for conducting roving sweeps through Los Angeles, apparently catching bystander day laborers or anyone who appeared Latino in their dragnet. The bill, they said, was their way of pushing back.
“We need a full front defense for the violence that is coming from this regime,” said Hector Pereyra, policy manager for the nonprofit Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, which co-sponsored the mask bill and another bill to protect the private data of street vendors. “We have to respond with a united front of strength and aggressiveness, not of passiveness.”

A federal judge in Missoula this week found that the U.S. Forest Service violated the law when authorizing expanded commercial livestock grazing leases north of Yellowstone National Park.  
In an order handed down Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy found that an Environmental Assessment conducted by the Forest Service was insufficient, as it did not adequately address the impacts to grizzly bears, an endangered species. 
“Despite knowing that livestock conflict remains a leading cause of death for grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Forest Service sought to expand cattle grazing on public lands surrounding the National Park,” said Patrick Kelly, Montana director with Western Watersheds Project, in a press release. “Judge Molloy’s decision has thankfully halted this misguided and illegal effort, likely preventing the deaths of many more grizzly bears.”
The order affirmed an earlier decision by federal judge Kathleen DeSoto.
Western Watersheds Project led a coalition of conservation groups in filing the lawsuit against the chief of the U.S. Forest Service and several federal agencies in 2022, arguing the government failed to consider the effects of expanded cattle grazing north of Yellowstone National Park on grizzlies under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.
The groups alleged that greenlighting grazing on an additional 1,356 acres for cows, along with a longer stock season with young calves, would lead to increased conflicts with grizzlies and greater mortality for the bears. 
The lawsuit notes portions of the six grazing allotments in question are in the grizzly bears’ Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem recovery zone. 
Arguing before Judge DeSoto last fall, a lawyer for the conservation groups, Matthew Bishop, said the Forest Service’s analysis of impacts was so cursory, it should at the very least be redone: “We heard more today on connectivity (for grizzly bears) than what’s in the record.”
But the Forest Service argued that it took a “hard look” at potential impacts on grizzlies as is required under NEPA, and the environmental assessment found limited impacts to the species’ population in the area. Attorneys for the federal government argued that because the proposed scope of grazing is limited, the impacts to grizzlies was also limited. 
This spring, DeSoto ruled in favor of the conservation groups. Under NEPA, she wrote, the federal government had failed to consider how the expanded grazing, and the cumulative effects of both public and private activities in the area, might affect connectivity of grizzly populations, a key to the species’ recovery and survival. She also found the agency failed to prepare an environmental impact statement, which is required by NEPA. 
However, she dismissed part of the complaint that the federal government had violated the Endangered Species Act. 
Both parties objected to parts of DeSoto’s ruling, but Molloy’s September order affirmed the decision. 
The court ultimately remanded the decision to the Forest Service to prepare a new analysis and vacated the decision to expand grazing on the six allotments. 
“The science is clear: grizzly bears need safe, livestock-free passage between population cores in order to fully recover,” said Lizzy Pennock, carnivore coexistence attorney at WildEarth Guardians, in a press statement. “We are grateful the judge redirected the U.S. Forest Service toward the best available science and its legal responsibility to protect wildlife.”
The other plaintiffs in the lawsuit are the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, the Native Ecosystems Council, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Wyoming Wildlife Advocates, the Sierra Club, Friends of the Bitterroot, Wildearth Guardians, and the Gallatin Wildlife Association.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Grizzly_credit-USGS-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-09-20 12:59:25.153017

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A long-running effort to broaden Colorado’s air pollution rules to include health limits on lesser-known hazards took another step forward on Friday, but advocates were again left frustrated by what they called a “missed opportunity” to go further.
Members of the state Air Quality Control Commission voted 8-0 to adopt an updated set of rules known as Regulation No. 30, establishing benchmarks for a group of “priority toxic air contaminants” identified by the commission earlier this year. The new health standards still need to be approved by the state Legislature, and they won’t be used in permitting or regulatory proceedings for at least another year.
Their enshrinement in Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment rules is another milestone for environmental and community groups that have fought for them for years — but it came with a reminder of the power that the business lobby has wielded in opposing those efforts at the state Capitol and beyond. Commissioners opted for a set of higher limits proposed by industry groups, rather than the lower limits proposed by environmental groups or a middle-ground position endorsed by CDPHE staff.

“This was a missed opportunity for the Commission to put community health first,” Patricia Garica-Nelson, an activist with nonprofit environmental organization GreenLatinos, said in a statement. “Coloradans came forward with powerful stories about the direct harm they face from toxic air pollution, yet decision-makers still chose weaker standards for most contaminants.”
The new rule’s five priority contaminants, also known as “air toxics,” were identified by state regulators with input from a scientific advisory group. They are among a class of hundreds of compounds classified as hazardous air pollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA, however, only sets federal health standards for a core group of six well-known “criteria” pollutants, including ozone and carbon monoxide, which are the target of extensive regulations under the Clean Air Act.










These exposures don’t act alone — they pile up, creating cumulative harms that send kids, the elderly, outdoor workers, and families living close to oil and gas wells to the ER and even shorten lives.


– Dr. Maria Chansky, advocate with Healthy Air and Water Colorado


In the absence of federal limits, Colorado has lagged behind other states in establishing its own state-level air toxics rules, and CDPHE came under scrutiny for allowing industrial pollution sources like Suncor Energy’s Commerce City oil refinery to effectively set their own emissions limits. After several years of trying, lawmakers representing Denver-area communities succeeded in passing a 2022 law directing the AQCC to begin regulating certain air toxics.
The five priority contaminants identified in the new rules are:

Benzene, a volatile organic compound often associated with oil and gas production and linked to leukemia and other adverse health effects
Hexavalent chromium, often emitted by industrial metal production and linked to lung cancer and respiratory problems
Ethylene oxide, often used to sterilize medical equipment and linked to cancers and respiratory problems
Formaldehyde, often associated with the production of wood products and resins and linked to cancers and other adverse health effects
Hydrogen sulfide, often associated with oil and gas production, wastewater and food processing plants, and linked to a variety of adverse health effects

High levels of hydrogen sulfide are believed to have caused the deaths of six people killed in an incident at a dairy farm in Weld County last month.
State law requires the AQCC to adopt “emission control regulations” pertaining to priority air toxics by April 30. CDPHE staff didn’t perform an economic impact analysis on the rule adopted Friday, they wrote, because for now it will have “no regulatory impact on any person, facility, or activity.”
“Once approved by the General Assembly, the health-based standards may be integrated into regulatory and/or permitting requirements,” staff wrote. “An analysis of potential economic impacts will be done at that time.”
The AQCC, a volunteer commission appointed by the governor, set the new standards by drawing on a variety of existing recommendations from EPA health assessments and regulations in other states. But members sided with industry groups in adopting a high “hazard quotient” for non-cancer exposure risks, rather than a lower quotient backed by CDPHE, which agency staff argued would account for cumulative exposures and provide “ample margin of safety, particularly for vulnerable groups.”
“These exposures don’t act alone — they pile up, creating cumulative harms that send kids, the elderly, outdoor workers, and families living close to oil and gas wells to the ER and even shorten lives,” Dr. Maria Chansky, a Glenwood Springs physician and advocate with Healthy Air and Water Colorado, said in a statement. “In light of ongoing federal environmental rollbacks, it is more important than ever that Colorado safeguard our air through strong health-based standards to curb harmful air toxics.”
Though he voted for the rule’s adoption, AQCC commissioner Jon Slutsky voiced uneasiness with siding against the calls of community advocates who testified before the commission about their experiences “living close to the problem.”
“When we have people in the community coming before us, time and time again … I think we have to do more than just listen to them,” Slutsky said. “We have to actually give them some love.”

The decision from Circuit Judge Daniel Green concluded that lawmakers properly combined bans on gender-affirming treatments for minors with reproductive rights in the proposed constitutional amendment but misled voters with the ballot language.
Quoting a Western District Court of Appeals ruling from 2020, Green wrote that “it was insufficient and unfair for a summary statement to fail to ‘alert voters to that change in some fashion.’”
And the ballot language, he wrote, fails to alert voters that it would repeal the reproductive rights section of the Missouri Constitution approved in the 2024 election.
In the ruling, Green ordered Secretary of State Denny Hoskins to submit revised language within seven days. Green also found that the “fair ballot language” summary posted on Hoskins’ office website was misleading for also failing to state abortion would be banned in most cases, and ordered revisions to be submitted within seven days.
The challenge to the proposal, which will appear as Amendment 3 on a ballot next year, asked Green to throw it out entirely for combining abortion and gender-affirming care for minors under 18. 
During an August hearing, attorney Chuck Hatfield argued that the inclusion of the gender-affirming health care ban was “ballot candy” meant to win over more voters but is a separate issue from reproductive health care.
Green disagreed in his ruling, saying the two issues are closely related enough to meet constitutional requirements for a single subject. In a footnote, Green pointed to the website of the Columbia Planned Parenthood clinic, which lists abortion and gender-affirming care among the services provided.
It is the ballot language that does not mention the abortion rights repeal, that is “insufficient and unfair,” Green wrote.
Republican state Senate leaders shut down a Democratic filibuster in May to push the measure to the ballot. 
If approved by a majority of voters, the abortion ban amendment would repeal a citizen-led reproductive rights amendment that passed last November legalizing abortion in Missouri until the point of fetal viability and enshrining other reproductive rights in the constitution, including in-vitro fertilization and contraceptives.
The new amendment would reinstate an abortion ban, allowing limited exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomolies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
After Hoskins delivers the revised language, parties in the case will have three days to submit arguments on whether it satisfies legal requirements.

(Photo by Eleonora Bianchi/The New Bedford Light)This story was first published Sept. 19, 2025 by The New Bedford Light.
The Interior Department agency regulating offshore wind development asked a federal judge on Thursday to revoke a key approval for the SouthCoast Wind project — an approval granted by the same agency in January in the final days of the Biden administration.
If the federal government’s request is approved, it would deal another blow to the beleaguered project — which has been delayed at least two years due to the Trump administration — and the industry at large.
This is the second time in a week that the administration has sought a remand of an offshore wind project approval, the other being for Maryland’s US Wind project. It comes just weeks after the Interior Department in court filings expressed its intent to remand not only its approval for SouthCoast Wind, but also New England Wind — two important projects for Massachusetts and New Bedford.
While the January approval, formally termed the Construction and Operations Plan (COP), gave the green light for construction, SouthCoast Wind was still hamstrung by three outstanding federal permits, and no power purchase agreement with Massachusetts or Rhode Island.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management filed the motion as part of a lawsuit brought by the Town of Nantucket in March against BOEM and Interior’s approval of the project, which calls for up to 147 turbines and would sit about 20 miles south of Nantucket (and south of Vineyard Wind).
This latest move illustrates the growing role that lawsuits brought by municipalities and activist groups against offshore wind are playing in President Trump’s crackdown on the industry. Of the 20 or so actions and orders issued since January, one has directed federal attorneys to review pending litigation against projects and consider a remand of permits that the litigation contests.
“BOEM is reviewing its approvals associated with the Project and has determined, based on its review to date, that it wishes to reconsider its COP approval. That is reason enough to grant a remand,” the new motion states.
Nantucket is asking the federal government to “set aside” its record of decision approving SouthCoast Wind and restart its environmental review — a process that took more than three years to complete and culminated in key permits allowing the project to move toward construction.
In Thursday’s filing, the government suggested the town’s concerns (and lawsuit) may become moot: “BOEM likely will take a further agency action, and that action may affect — and possibly moot — Plaintiffs’ claims.”
The motion and a declaration filed by BOEM Deputy Director Matthew Giacona are littered with references to Trump’s day-one wind memo and the subsequent actions that it has borne.
This includes the withdrawal of a 2021 opinion on how the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) should be interpreted, and the reinstatement of an opinion from the first Trump administration on the law. The motion states that BOEM staff are reevaluating all agency decisions that relied on the since-withdrawn 2021 opinion, which also informed the approval of New England Wind.
Under the reinstated opinion, Giacona said, SouthCoast Wind’s COP approval may not be compliant with OCSLA.
“BOEM determined that it ‘may have failed to account for all the impacts that the SouthCoast Wind Project may cause,’” the motion states. “BOEM also found that the Environmental Impact Statement and other record documents may have ‘understated or obfuscated impacts that could have subsequently been improperly weighed in making the determinations.’”
Giacona’s declaration also appears to call into question the lease itself, which SouthCoast Wind paid millions for and has been paying hundreds of thousands in annual payments to the federal government since.
He said the project-wide review, ordered under the day-one wind memo, “could result in identifying potential issues with SouthCoast’s lease” and that the timeline for that review is “uncertain.”
Ocean Winds North America, the project’s parent company, in a statement to The Light said it plans to “vigorously defend our permits in federal court.”
“SouthCoast Wind’s Construction and Operations Plan (COP) was approved … after a rigorous four-year review,” the statement read. “This review reflected an extensive public process that incorporated feedback from federal and state government agencies, commercial ocean users, Tribal Nations, and many other stakeholders. Stable permitting for American infrastructure projects should be of top concern for anyone who wants to see continued investment in the United States.”
SouthCoast Wind is an intervenor in the case and opposed the government’s motion. The project plans to use the Port of New Bedford for staging out of the Marine Commerce Terminal and for long-term operations and maintenance.
Mayor Jon Mitchell previously said a delay or cancellation of New England Wind and SouthCoast Wind could mean a loss of up to 200 jobs in the city.
According to Oceantic Network, an organization supporting the industry, SouthCoast Wind expects to invest $6 billion in the U.S. through wages for union labor; shipbuilding with a Louisiana port and shipbuilder; steel from Alabama and Kentucky; and investments in port infrastructure, including the New Bedford terminal.
Gov. Maura Healey, in an emailed statement Friday, said the project will create “thousands of good-paying jobs” and provide reliable, affordable power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses.
“This project has been thoroughly vetted and has already undergone years of expert review,” Healey said. “There is absolutely no need for the Trump Administration to reopen permitting processes and deny jobs, investment and energy power to the states.”
Healey’s office did not respond to a question as to whether it plans to intervene.
The request for a remand will be decided by a federal judge.
Per the federal government’s filing, “District courts have broad discretion to grant or deny remands and may deem a remand inappropriate ‘if the agency’s request appears to be frivolous or made in bad faith,’” but it also says courts “commonly” grant them.
As this plays out, more than a dozen states, including Massachusetts, are waiting on a federal judge to rule whether Trump’s first-day wind memo, the action underlying all of this, is unlawful. It’s unclear when that decision will come, and what scope of relief it could provide to the states, which are relying on the projects to meet climate mandates and rising grid demand.

By Ryan Colasanti, contributing Journalist
GREENWOOD, DE — Milford running back Andrew Sivels settled two yards behind his quarterback in the pistol formation with his pink gloves resting on his knees. Buccaneer quarterback Cayden Jarrett received the snap and turned toward Sivels.
Sivels took the handoff, took three steps to his left, paused as the running lane closed and redirected toward the middle of the field. Sivels’ patience paid off as a wide open running lane emerged, allowing him to sprint upfield for a 46-yard touchdown on Milford’s first offensive possession of the game.
Sivels scored four of the Buccaneers’ five touchdowns, leading Milford to its first win of the season, 35-0, over the Woodbridge Blue Raiders, Friday night.
Sivels, junior Tyjere Perry, and senior Gregory Lockett were a dominant trio on the ground. The three ball carriers combined for over 200 rushing yards and accounted for all five of Milford’s scores.
Four of the five touchdowns belonged to Sivels and the junior was responsible for over 120 of Milford’s rushing yards. Sivels’ ground totals were boosted by a 57-yard touchdown in the middle of the third quarter, adding to his long touchdown in the first. Sivels’ other two touchdowns came on shorter runs near the goal line as did Perry’s lone touchdown run on the Buccaneers’ opening possession out of halftime.
Jarrett’s right arm did a good job complementing the run game. Jarrett completed a few passes, including a deep pass down the right sideline to Jayden Williams for a gain of 32 yards that set up Perry’s touchdown run a few plays later. Williams made a tremendous catch, leaping over his defender to come down with the grab.
The Buccaneers’ defense fed off the energy of its offense and held the Blue Raiders without a score. Woodbridge was able to drive into the red zone a couple of times, but Milford’s defense stopped them before they could reach the end zone. The Buccaneers also forced a couple of takeaways in the first half that stalled any momentum Woodbridge developed.
The Buccaneers’ 35 points are the most they’ve scored this season, topping the 33 they scored in their first game of the season against Conrad. Milford’s victory breaks a stretch of four consecutive losses against Woodbridge dating back to right after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Blue Raiders will try and bounce back from this game as they travel to Abessinio Stadium next Thursday to take on a Howard team that beat Appoquinimack Friday night.
The Buccaneers will try and build off their victory against Delmar next Friday in their third of four straight road games after beginning the season at home.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/milford-vs.-Woodbridge-2025-scaled.png,,,2025-09-20 09:59:12.315501

The numbers come from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which reports bird flu detections in eight commercial South Dakota flocks and one backyard flock in the state during the last 30 days. 
Meanwhile, South Dakota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said blue-winged teal, a species of duck, have been identified as carriers of this season’s virus. John Cooper, a former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent and former state Game, Fish and Parks secretary, said it makes sense that the state would find itself combating bird flu early this year if teal are carrying it.
“Teal are traditionally our first migrators,” Cooper said.

Detections this early in the fall season are troubling, according to Thompson. The peak avian influenza seasons typically happen later during the fall and spring migration of wild birds, which can carry the virus without becoming sick.
In a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, the state Department of Health said “bird flu has the potential to be transmitted to humans from wild birds” but emphasized the risk to people remains low. 
The department pointed to federal guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which offers steps for hunters to reduce risks:

Gut and de-feather game birds in the field rather than at home and practice good hygiene to prevent disease spread.
Use dedicated tools for cleaning game, do not use the same tools around poultry, and wash and disinfect all tools and work surfaces afterward.
Wear gloves, a mask and eye protection when handling game birds.
Throw away the gloves and facemask afterward and wash hands with soap and water.
Cook meat to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

Commercial turkey products remain safe to eat thanks to existing food safety protocols in the industry, according to Thompson.
The bird flu depopulation process is federally mandated and involves killing all birds at affected sites to prevent the virus from spreading to nearby farms. Thompson said “foaming” is the most common method in turkey barns, where foam is sprayed atop turkeys inside the barn to suffocate them. 
She said the process is carried out with assistance from federal and state officials who oversee the work, with the federal government offering compensation for losses through indemnity payments. Those payments have totaled more than $1 billion nationally since 2020, according to an analysis by CBS News, including about $130 million in South Dakota.
 



 Recent avian influenza detections in South Dakota

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture lists the following detections of avian influenza during the past 30 days in commercial or backyard flocks in South Dakota. The list includes the number of birds killed in response to contain the spread of the disease.

Sept. 16: Commercial turkey meat bird in Beadle County, 53,000 birds affected.

Each has its own funding challenges. Some may put an emphasis on college preparation while others may seek to get students ready for the workforce. The beauty of local control is that it allows the school district patrons, through their school board, to decide how students should be educated.
That individuality is apparent in the way districts have approached student use of cellphones in the classroom. According to a South Dakota Searchlight survey and analysis of school district policies, about 60% of school districts in the state restrict cellphone use for at least part of the school day. About a third of districts take the further step of locking away students’ cellphones for at least a portion of the day.
While some schools may restrict student cellphone use in an effort to keep them from being distractions, in Wilmot the students are allowed to keep their phones as a way to teach them a lesson in responsibility. This contrasts quite a bit with the policy in other districts including Dupree, where high school students are required to put their cellphones in containers during the school day.
Three of five SD governor hopefuls endorse statewide approach to cellphones in classrooms

It’s that kind of difference, from school district to school district, that helps reflect the philosophy of educators, the needs of the individual communities and the strength of local control.
“There’s never going to be a one-size-fits-all,” said Dupree School District superintendent Brent Mareska.
Well, hold the phone.
One policy for every school district is exactly what three of the five candidates for governor are proposing. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, a Republican candidate for governor, said in a South Dakota Searchlight story that he would back a statewide prohibition on student access to cellphones during classes.
“The state government setting a broad-stroke policy and then having the execution of that strategy and management done at the local level will give us the best of both worlds,” Johnson said.
Of course, one of those worlds, in Pierre, would set the policy for all the school districts. Those districts, whether they like it or not, would have to carry it out, without regard for their current cellphone policy. A policy that may be working just fine for them.
South Dakota House Speaker Jon Hansen, another Republican candidate, would also support a statewide policy as a way for students to focus “on learning, not on distractions.” Democrat Robert Arnold, a 20-year-old college student who plans to run for governor, said a statewide policy would benefit students.
Another Republican candidate, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, said the decision on cellphone policy should be left up to school boards, though his approach seems more like a Mafia don than a governor: “As governor, I would absolutely lean on our local school boards to ban cellphones from the classroom.”

While Doeden would make school districts an offer they can’t refuse, Gov. Larry Rhoden, who has yet to declare his candidacy, is quizzing school leaders about whether they want their policy to come from the local level or the state. Some schools may welcome a state law, allowing them to put what could be an unpopular policy in place, all the while laying the blame at the feet of the Legislature.
Judging by the performance of the Legislature in 2025, it would be wise to leave decisions about education to school districts. A completely unscientific search of the Legislative Research Council website found that the Legislature considered 59 education bills this year. Among them were such winners as a failed requirement to display and add to the curriculum the Ten Commandments, a withdrawn effort to defund the Huron School District because of its bathroom policy, and a failed requirement to display the state seal.
A track record like that doesn’t inspire confidence in a Legislature or a governor who wants to make a one-size-fits-all cellphone policy. Obviously school districts are getting by just fine without a mandate from the state about how to regulate cellphones in the classroom. That’s how local control is supposed to work.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2158370531-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-20 09:59:12.315501

Jones, left, and Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell. Photos courtesy of Washington State University and University of Washington. For the first time in nearly a decade, Washington’s two largest universities welcomed new presidents within the same year. 
Elizabeth Cantwell became the first female president of Washington State University in April, and Robert J. Jones, in August, became the first Black president of the University of Washington. 
The two leaders made a joint appearance this week at the Association of Washington Business 2025 Policy Summit, in a panel mirroring one held at the summit in 2016. 
The summit brings together business leaders, policy experts and elected officials.  
During the panel, both university leaders lamented the breakdown of partnerships between universities and the federal government, and emphasized the need for more investment in higher education, especially in research.
“There’s an absolute bottom line for the time period that we’re in. If you continue to disrupt that bottom line, it will take decades to recover this nation to being the cutting edge for innovation, if we’re able to recover,” Jones said. 
Like most universities, Washington State University and the University of Washington each rely heavily on federal and state research dollars, as well as tuition, to maintain their operations. 
The money invested into research goes back to local economies, Cantwell said, adding that the research done at the University of Washington and Washington State University has helped drive the state’s economy for decades. 
“The ability to continue doing that is in jeopardy at the moment,” she added.
Jones and Cantwell both stressed the importance of continuing research into quantum computing and artificial intelligence. 
Both are developing fields that will become critical within the next decade, Jones and Cantwell said. 
“It’s not just about creating that technology. It’s: How do you also start to think about the research and innovation? How do you connect that to workforce development and opportunities for young people when they graduate to have jobs in this area?” Jones said. 
Washington is “incredibly well-positioned” to be a leader in quantum computing and AI research, Cantwell said. But amid ongoing state and federal budget pressures, further development in these fields will depend on how well institutions can collaborate rather than compete with each other.  
“There has to be this wide, deep collaboration among institutions that have the wherewithal to solve the problem,” Jones said. 
The presidents also acknowledged challenges around attracting students and the need to adjust their institutions’ offerings to cater to shifting workforce needs and to collaborate with K-12 leaders to increase high school graduation rates. 
Compared to fall 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, undergraduate enrollment this year  is down by about 4,600 students at Washington State University. At the University of Washington, it climbed by about 2,500 students between 2019 and the 2024-25 academic year.
Education leaders blame sluggish enrollment on drops in high school graduation rates and college readiness, but also the growing notion amongst students that college degrees aren’t valuable in the current economy. 
“A college degree is not just a personal benefit,” Jones said. “It’s a community benefit. It impacts all of us.”.
University leaders, Jones and Cantwell said, have a responsibility to work with K-12 educators to improve college readiness and to work with businesses to ensure students are learning the skills they need to get quality jobs. 
Teaching skills related to evolving technology like AI, as well as investing in training for specific trades, will likely be part of the solution, they said.  
“We all have, as public institutions, the obligation to provide the education that we have to the people who want it where they are and when they need it,” Cantwell said.  
Cantwell previously led Utah State University for 18 months and has held senior research positions at the University of Arizona and Arizona State University, as well as roles at several national laboratories. 
She pointed to Washington State University’s history as a land-grant institution, which receives money from the federal government for agricultural teaching and research, as a reason why she accepted the position. 
“There is a thread of history that is still meaningful today and meaningful into the future,” Cantwell said, calling Washington State University “one of the most iconic land grants in the entire country.” 
Jones joined the University of Washington following nine years as the chancellor of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and three years as president of the State University of New York at Albany. Before entering administration, he was a faculty member at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities for 34 years. 
“This is not my first rodeo, but it clearly will be my last,” Jones said, adding that he is excited to be “leading a university like the University of Washington at one of the most exciting but also most challenging periods in the history of all of our education.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uw-wsu-presidents-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-20 07:56:58.478410

The Quantifying Uncertainty and Action to Help Optimize Growth […],"Northern quahog clams. (Photo by NOAA Fisheries/Julie Rose)A bipartisan bill introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) aims to address the decline of the quahog and other shellfish populations on the East Coast — and the legislation even bears the name of Rhode Island’s official state shell.
The Quantifying Uncertainty and Action to Help Optimize Growth of Shellfish (QUAHOGS) Act would create a research task force of state and federal agency representatives, fishery management councils, and industry leaders dubbed the “East Coast Bivalve Research Task Force” to find out why fewer bivalves are in the water.
At its peak in 1959, nearly 5 million pounds of quahogs were harvested from Rhode Island waters, according to a March 2024 report by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM). Between 2020 and 2023, that number was less than 500,000 pounds.
“Quahogging in Narragansett Bay is a quintessential Rhode Island trade whose harvest brings us the Ocean State summer staples of clear chowder and stuffies,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “Unfortunately, quahog and other shellfish landings are in steady decline across the Eastern Seaboard, and it’s been difficult for shell fisherman and researchers to pinpoint exactly why.”
A state legislative commission spent nearly a year studying the quahog’s decline, but the 13-member panel never firmly settled on a definitive cause following eight public hearings. Their final report published in June 2024 did note that global climate change may be having an impact. More likely, the panel said, low levels of nitrogen in Narragansett Bay has decreased the nutrients quahogs feed on. 
The nitrogen decrease resulted from the state’s goal to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment facilities, leading shellfishermen on the panel to urge the state to permit additional nitrogen discharges treatment plants during the winter to fertilize more phytoplankton that feed quahogs.
The commission’s report stopped short of recommending such discharges.
Instead, the report called on lawmakers to increase funding for the state-funded Shellfish Transplant Program — which involves moving shellfish from waters that are closed off due to pollution into other areas where commercial harvesting is permitted. The practice began in 1954 and has occurred annually in Rhode Island since the late 1970s, with funding provided by fines levied on municipal wastewater treatment facilities.
This year saw a House resolution that would have allocated $2.3 million for the DEM to transplant more quahogs into Narragansett Bay and establish a shellfish hatchery program, but the proposal died in committee.
Commission members also recommended establishing a permanent quahog advisory commission or similar board composed of stakeholders — somewhat similar to the federal proposal now floated by Whitehouse.
Stephen DeLeo, a spokesperson for Whitehouse’s office, confirmed the state legislative commission served as inspiration for the bill.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Five Idaho legislators participated in a bipartisan conference for American state legislators this week that took place in and was sponsored by Israel amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner, R-Eagle; House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, House Local Government Committee Chairwoman Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls; House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee Chairman Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa; and Rep. John Shirts, R-Weiser, participated in the trip.
Boise State Public Radio first reported Wednesday that Idaho legislators were among 250 state legislators from across the United States who visited Israel to participate in the 50 States, One Israel conference. 
Skaug, Shirts and Rubel confirmed publicly they participated in the trip. Efforts to reach Ehardt and Tanner were unsuccessful on Friday.
The Idaho state legislators’ visit occurred amid the ongoing Gaza war as Israel sent ground troops and tanks into Gaza City. This week the U.N.’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory released a report stating Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. 
On Tuesday, the Idaho Israel Alliance posted photos of Rubel, Shirts, Skaug, Ehardt and Tanner planting a tree and Idaho flag at Ofakim Park, one of the Israeli communities attacked by Hamas and other militant groups on Oct. 7, 2023.

 Group of Idaho Democrats call for Rubel to step down from Idaho House minority leadership

On Friday, the Idaho Young Democrats released a statement strongly disagreeing with Rubel participating in a trip financed by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A group of Idaho Democrats also circulated a letter Friday condemning Rubel for participating in the trip and calling for Rubel to step down from her leadership position and reconsider serving in public office.
Rubel told the Idaho Capital Sun she was invited by the Israeli Consulate and chose to go on the trip because she viewed it as a unique learning experience. As a Democrat in the political minority in Idaho, Rubel said she often has to meet with and work with people she disagrees with. Rubel said she viewed the Israel trip in a similar light and said the trip proved to be a valuable learning experience. 
“I didn’t think there would ever be a time when I would again have this level of exposure to decision makers, this ability to ask questions or the ability to access places I otherwise never would have,” Rubel said Friday. “It was an educational opportunity to inform myself and convey my own concerns to decision makers at a level I would probably never have an opportunity like that again.”
 Skaug and Rubel said they did not spent any Idaho taxpayer dollars on the trip

Skaug said Friday that he was invited on the trip by the Israeli Consulate out of San Francisco, which paid for all the expenses.
Skaug said he believes he was invited because he is pro-Israel and co-sponsored Senate Bill 1086, Idaho’s Anti-Boycott Against Isreal Act, in 2021. 
During the trip, Skaug said he heard from several Israeli leaders and was in close proximity to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Skaug said he also visited the old city wall of Jerusalem, where he prayed and posted photos taken with Shirts and Tanner. 
Skaug said he took the trip to build relationships, learn from people in Israel and meet other legislators from across the U.S.

“We have legislators go to Taiwan, China, Mexico and all over the world on trade missions or to build relationships,” Skaug said. “That is the same as how I see this Israel trip, to build relationships and also hopefully more trade.” 
Skaug said he and other legislators met with families who lost loved ones in the Oct. 7 attack against Israel.
As he traveled home Friday, Skaug said he left feeling hopeful for peace in the Middle East. 
Reached Friday, Shirts confirmed he participated in the trip too. Shirts is a former assistant U.S. attorney for Idaho who was appointed during President Donald Trump’s first term and serves as a prosecutor in the Air Force Reserve.
“I am a strong supporter of Israel and its fight against terrorism,” Shirts said in a written message to the Idaho Capital Sun. “I was grateful for the opportunity to see firsthand the challenges Israel and the region are facing and to strengthen relationships with a longtime ally of our country.”
Rubel also said she did not spend Idaho taxpayer dollars on the trip. She said she made it clear to organizers her visit is not an endorsement of Netanyahu’s government.  
During the trip, Rubel said she spoke up in front of Israel President Isaac Herzog during a state dinner and said the American public has grave concerns about the civilian casualties in Gaza and that the staggering loss of life is causing Israel to lose the hearts and minds of the American public.
Rubel also said she asked about famine in Gaza and sought out people with different perspectives and viewpoints. 
“I went to gain a deeper understanding of this conflict and to have direct conversations with leaders about the war in Gaza — including asking hard, necessary questions,” Rubel wrote in a message posted to social media Thursday. 
“As a Democrat in Idaho’s superminority, I often engage with people whose views are very different from mine,” Rubel added. “Listening and asking questions isn’t a sign of agreement — it’s a way to build understanding and find a path forward, even when the issues are deeply painful and divisive. The suffering in Gaza is unimaginable, as is the suffering of the families of the October 7 victims and hostages. Tens of thousands of innocent people, including children, have been killed or displaced. Families have been torn apart, and entire communities destroyed. This violence must end, and many across the world will likely have to participate to bring a lasting peace.”
“As a Jewish woman and the descendant of Holocaust refugees, I carry a personal connection to this region and its history,” Rubel wrote in Thursday’s message on social media. “My family’s story is one of survival in the face of hatred, and that history fuels my commitment to justice, even when it requires difficult conversations. For more than a decade, I’ve fought tirelessly for progressive causes here in Idaho, and have found that it is always a good idea to learn more about every issue and perspective.” 
 More than 150 people sign letter calling for Rubel to step down from her Democratic leadership position in the Idaho House

In a statement released Friday, the Idaho Young Democrats said it strongly disagreed with Rubel’s decision to participate in the trip. 
“At a time when Palestinians are facing violence and a disturbing humanitarian crisis — a genocide – her participation in this trip sends the wrong message,” Idaho Young Democrats said. “While we appreciate her explanation, in which she clearly condemned the actions of the Israeli government, we feel that given the nature of the trip, her decision to participate does not reflect the values of our community.”
The Idaho Young Democrats also spoke out against Republicans on the trip and said Rubel has a duty to distinguish between herself and her Republican colleagues. 
“Last year, the Idaho Democratic Party overwhelmingly passed a ceasefire resolution introduced by Idaho Young Democrats, affirming our party’s commitment to peace, justice, and human rights,” the Idaho Young Democrats said. “We continue to condemn the mass displacement, indiscriminate bombing, and killing of countless civilians by the Israeli government, and reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire, release of all hostages, and to fight against antisemitism, which has skyrocketed. We call for accountability and solidarity from our legislators.”
On Friday, 157 people who identified themselves as Idaho Democrats signed a letter to Rubel and issued a press release calling on Rubel to step down from her leadership position with House Democrats and apologize to Idahoans. 
As House minority leader, Rubel is the highest ranking Democrat in the Idaho House of Representatives
The letter included the signers’ first and last names, followed by their legislative district number.
In bold letters, the letter states “Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.”
“Less than 50 miles from your Israeli-funded propaganda trip, Israel has been engaged in the nonstop bombardment of Palestinians for nearly two years,” the letter states. “Israel has killed at least 64,964 people and wounded at least 165,312 Palestinians — over 10% of the population of Gaza…”
Shiva Rajbhandari, a climate activist and former Boise School District Board member, signed the letter and shared it with the Idaho Capital Sun. Rajbhandari is a registered Idaho voter affiliated with the Idaho Democratic Party, Idaho voter records show. Rajbhandari is a college student and activist studying public policy and sociology at the University of North Carolina. 
Rajbhandari said he has called on all Idaho legislators who participated in the Israel trip to resign. But the letter from Democrats is specifically addressed to Rubel as a leader of their party, Rajbhandari said. 
“The 157 signers are focused on the moral leadership of the Democratic Party and differentiating our party’s politics from the pro-genocide platform of the GOP,” Rajbhandari told the Sun on Friday morning.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)NORTH PLATTE, Neb. — After three months in ICE detention, legal fees mounting and no release in sight, Nuri Garibo Chona did what she called unimaginable. She left behind four daughters to return to the birthplace where she hadn’t lived for decades. The Omaha mom was here illegally. Her kids are all U.S. citizens, and younger ones now are in the care of her oldest daughter, who is 27. 
Another woman ensnared in the Glenn Valley Foods immigration raid in Omaha also was removed to Mexico last week without her two children, who remained in Omaha with their dad. On her way out, Leydy Solis Factor said she still was confused about why the work permit she got through proper channels was no longer good.

Meanwhile, one of the men still held from the raid in the Lincoln County Jail has hired a local lawyer to replace an out-of-state firm and prays he hasn’t lost a shot at being released on bond. He has a wife and children in Omaha and fears for their safety if he is forced back to Guatemala.
The number of Glenn Valley workers detained in this North Platte jail, which is paid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain migrants, has dwindled since the high-profile worksite raid executed June 10 by more than 80 federal and local agents. 
Shortly after the Nebraska Examiner visited the facility last week, Garibo Chona and Solis Factor were removed from the country, and three other women were released on bond, leaving six from the Glenn Valley raid among those in custody there. 
ICE officials did not provide specifics when asked this week for an update, but of the original group of roughly 80 arrested, a spokesperson previously said about a dozen were released early and 63 were sent to North Platte. Several agreed to voluntarily deport themselves, and many have been released on bond as their lawyers build cases to prevent forced removal.
To State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, their journeys and circumstances have become even more relevant as the state prepares to repurpose a state prison into a  300-bed ICE detention center in McCook, a town of about 7,200 residents about an hour from North Platte.

Last week she became the first state lawmaker to sit down with Glenn Valley detainees. The discussion ranged from medical, legal and interpreter services to how their children were faring. After meeting with men and women garbed in black and white stripes, Juarez stepped into a nearby hall and cried. 
She said she’s on a mission to ensure that federal ICE detainees in Nebraska have access to the same services offered to state inmates in state prisons.
“It was really difficult to see the reality, the human faces,” said Juarez, whose South Omaha district includes the Glenn Valley plant and other meatpackers that traditionally have attracted immigrant workers.
 “These are people locked up away from family,” she said. “We have jailed innocent working people.”
* * * 
The federal government has a different viewpoint. 
Representatives of ICE and its Homeland Security Investigations arm have repeatedly referred to the Glenn Valley case as a targeted, federal criminal investigation aimed at stopping the widespread use of stolen identifications by foreign-born workers to gain jobs.
“These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans,” HSI’s Mark Zito has said. “If pretending to be someone you aren’t in order to steal their lives isn’t blatant criminal dishonesty, I don’t know what is.”
Court documents track the Omaha raid  — the largest immigration enforcement action in Nebraska since 2018 — back to a March subpoena that sought company employment records tying 107 of 177 employees to fraudulent IDs or documents that didn’t authorize them to work in the country.

At least one defrauded U.S. citizen already had lodged identity theft complaints with the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration. During the raid, agents questioned a worker whose job application matched the name of that complainant — leading to the arrest of Guadalupe Cabrera Mejia.
To date, available federal court records show Cabrera Mejia as the only Glenn Valley employee criminally charged for the alleged use of a stolen ID. Asked how that reconciled with “widespread” criminal activity alleged earlier, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Nebraska said ICE determines whether to pursue felony criminal charges. 
With regard to the Glenn Valley probe, she said, ICE elected “overwhelmingly” to pursue administrative charges in immigration court, a venue and process independent of federal prosecutors.
ICE has said an administrative charge is often a more expedient option, a faster path to deportation. The raid came as federal agencies are under pressure from the Trump administration’s goal of making 3,000 related arrests per day and pursuing mass deportations.

In Nebraska, Gov. Jim Pillen, backed by many legislative Republicans, has pledged resources to help President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda. Among state offerings: turning the McCook-based Work Ethic Camp into a Midwestern ICE detention center that federal officials dubbed the “Cornhusker Clink.” 
That conversion plan requires the relocation of 186 state inmates elsewhere in a Nebraska correctional system already ranked as the most crowded in the country, when measured by operational capacity. The decision to offer ICE state assistance sparked protests at the Governor’s Mansion and a four-hour public hearing that drew dozens of opponent speakers and no proponents.
Scant details shared about the project is partly what Juarez said spurred her to make the trek west to the jail in North Platte and prison in McCook. 
“This isn’t going away,” she said. “They’re amping up enforcement, and I really wanted to see and hear from these families for myself.”

On a day last week, Lincoln County Sheriff Jerome Kramer accompanied Juarez into separate cell blocs for men and women. The Examiner was allowed as well.
Women set aside Bibles and art materials and huddled around the silver table where the lawmaker sat. An interpreter from a local advocacy group called Hope Esperanza helped bridge any language gaps.

Kramer praised the nonprofit’s founder, North Platte native TinaMaria Fernandez, for having eased stress that came with the sudden swell of inmates whose first language was different from that of his staff. 
The arrival of the Glenn Valley group increased the jail population by about 50% at a time the facility was short-staffed, Kramer said. He said the federal government pays the county $74 a day for each ICE detainee and covers transportation and medical expenses.
“If I remember it right, they called to see if we could take them and said they’d be here in three hours,” Kramer said. 
Juarez viewed as a positive sign the rapport between Hope Esperanza, Kramer and his team and detainees. She wondered out loud if McCook has a similar community organization able to assist in that town’s future ICE detention operation.
Fernandez said that while McCook is about an hour’s drive away, she didn’t see her team being able to provide similar humanitarian outreach at that facility, since the oversight would be federal versus local county officials. 
Most of the women, in response to Juarez’s queries, said they hadn’t visited with family members face-to-face but had been able to communicate via video conferencing. 
Jail staff have been respectful and responsive, several said. Another added: “It’s ugly. We’re locked up.” 
Isabel Ponce, a 34-year-old mother of three kids who are with their father in Omaha, said anxiety was “pushing my limits.” 
For some, legal relief has been grinding or nonexistent.
In Garibo Chona’s case, for example, an immigration judge ordered her removal from the country. She was torn about appealing and leaving her daughters but said the judge told her he would not change his mind if her case came before him six months later. She was removed from the country last week.
Solis Factor said she had a government-issued permit to work while awaiting a court hearing, so she at first was not concerned she’d be detained. But many immigration programs and rules have changed since Trump took office for the second time in January. And a judge ordered her removal.
“I want my children to stay and continue their education and learning English,” she said of her kids, ages 5 and 10.

In the men’s detention quarters, Juarez asked a small group if they had a criminal background.
“We are workers,” said Juan Ramirez Jacinto of Guatemala. He said he had three children and a wife in Omaha and was especially worried about a daughter who hadn’t been able to sleep well.
Ramirez Jacinto’s first lawyer was part of a group based in another state. His new attorney, Jamie Arango of Lincoln, said she is trying to make up for time lost to ineffective counsel and will seek his release on bond. 
Even with attentive representation, Arango and other experts say an already complex immigration system on top of fast-changing federal policies understandably leaves clients puzzled.

Indeed, the swiftly-evolving immigration landscape has been playing out in an Omaha courtroom.
U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Bataillon at least nine times has rejected attempts by the federal government to deny the release of Glenn Valley workers on bonds already granted by an immigration court judge.

The three most recent cases were decided Sept. 11 and involved women who had met with Juarez. Among them was Yurenia Genchi Palma, a single mother of three U.S. citizen children who had been in the country more than 20 years. 
Though an immigration judge in mid-July granted Genchi Palma’s release on a $7,000 bond, federal attorneys blocked it by filing an “automatic stay.” Nebraska Appleseed, which represents her, called that a new practice driven by the “interim guidance” leaked in a July 8 internal memo from the Trump administration. 
The new approach seeks to make nearly all detained immigrants facing removal proceedings ineligible for release on bond, with an aim of making more of them more likely to self deport, experts say. 
ICE has said the changed direction “closes a loophole to our nation’s security” that the Biden administration and others had based on “inaccurate interpretation” of federal law. Such measures are needed, says Trump and other supporters of stepped-up immigration enforcement, to reverse past patterns.
Bataillon ruled the automatic stay provision and prolonged detention unconstitutional despite a Sept. 6 decision days before by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which had affirmed the “interim guidance.” 
As a federal court judge, Bataillon is not required to follow the decision of the BIA, an administrative body in the executive branch. He questioned the legal rationale behind the analysis but said that wasn’t his concern. 
He said his ruling was based only on the lawfulness of the automatic stay. 
Grant Friedman of ACLU Nebraska foresees continued legal challenges and noted that the ICE no-bond practice already is being challenged in a separate national class action lawsuit. He said ACLU and other advocates are on heightened alert.
“The immigration landscape is rapidly changing,” Friedman said. “We are doing everything we can to make sure people are being treated fairly, that they have their rights respected.”
Anne Wurth, associate legal director of the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, which has assisted many Glenn Valley workers, called the current landscape “absolute chaos.”
 “We have a system that is punishing individuals we rely on in our workforce and who are just humans who deserve to live their life with freedom,” she said.

Juarez said dealing with immigration-related matters was not something she expected as a state officeholder. She’s the first Latina in the Nebraska Legislature and is serving her first year as a state lawmaker.

A Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, she recently clashed over immigration policy in an email exchange with former Nebraska governor and now U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Nebraska, and plans to urge the state’s all-GOP congressional delegation to push for immigration reform. She toured the  McCook jail after leaving North Platte, and vows to monitor the conversion and amplify related budget discussions. 
“There’s no doubt I’m going to stand up,” said Juarez. “My community expects that.”
For Ramirez Jacinto, each day in detention brings worry. Is his daughter able to sleep yet? Are the house bills paid? Will his family in Omaha go with him if he’s deported? How will they escape the violence?
“I’d like my family to stay, but who would work?” said Ramirez Jacinto. “I’m the worker.”

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Complaints filed with the Arkansas Ethics Commission this week claim three Republican state officials and political action committees tied to them “appear to have repeatedly and willfully violated” state campaign finance law.
The co-founders of an online legislation tracking and analysis firm said in a press release Friday that they’d filed the complaints with the ethics panel. By law, the ethics commission cannot confirm it received the complaints.
The 29-page package provided by ArkLeg Bill Tracker co-founder Janie Ginocchio alleges that Attorney General Tim Griffin, state Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, and state Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, and PACs associated with them violated campaign contribution limits and prohibitions on illegal coordination of contributions, the use of public property for campaign purposes and public servants receiving outside payment for carrying out official duties. 
“The enclosed materials detail a pattern of conduct centered on Attorney General Tim Griffin and his PAC, Jobs and Growth (JAG PAC), which allegedly utilized a network of controlled PACs — including those operated by his campaign manager, Rep. David Ray; Sen. Ben Gilmore; and associates of the Gilmore Strategy Group — to launder contributions, evade contribution limits, and obscure the true source of campaign funds,” a letter accompanying the complaints states.

Ginocchio’s complaints also allege that Ray’s receipt of campaign funds from Griffin, while a sitting legislator who filed bills affecting the attorney general’s office, created a severe conflict of interest and the appearance of quid pro quo.”
Ray, Gilmore and Griffin all characterized the complaints as frivolous and politically motivated. 
The package of complaints include allegations that:

Griffin illegally accepted over-the-limit campaign contributions, used state resources for campaign purposes and “convert[ed] campaign funds into a personal slush fund to pay for official government operations.”
Griffin’s political action committee, Jobs and Growth PAC, violated state ethics law by using a state vehicle owned by the attorney general’s office for campaign-related purposes.
Ray improperly accepted more than $130,000 in cash from Griffin’s campaign during legislative sessions, “constituting unlawful outside compensation for his official duties as a state legislator” and that the payments coincided with Ray’s sponsorship of several bills that expanded the power of the attorney general’s office.
A network of PACs controlled by Griffin, Gilmore, Ray and Gilmore Strategy Group, owned by the senator’s brother Jon Gilmore, “worked in concert” to conceal the true source of funds to Griffin’s campaign.
Gilmore Strategy Group PAC made contributions over the campaign finance maximum of $3,300 per election to Griffin’s campaign.
Base Point PAC, the senator’s political action committee, made over-the-limit contributions to Griffin’s campaign.

In a text to the Advocate, Griffin said: “These politically-motivated complaints are a total joke and are deeply unserious to anyone who knows anything about Arkansas law. My campaign and political action committee go to great lengths to follow all applicable laws and rules, and I look forward to this frivolous complaint being dismissed.”

“It is without a doubt a frivolous attack against me and other conservative Republicans,” Ben Gilmore said in an email, “and it is without question politically motivated. As always, I will continue to follow the law and should the Ethics Commission contact me, I will work with them to prove that to be the case.”
Ray said the complaint “might be the dumbest thing I’ve ever read. It is completely false, totally frivolous, and not even worth the paper it’s printed on. These left-wing activists are attacking me because I’m an effective Republican legislator and they don’t like my politics. I am not intimidated by their baseless attacks — in fact, they only motivate me to work even harder to advance conservative policies and principles.”
Ginocchio also filed ethics complaints against Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge and Secretary of State Cole Jester for filing incomplete and inaccurate campaign finance reports.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tim-Griffin-debate-e1697496889763-1024x605.jpg,,,2025-09-20 05:56:59.835594

(timnewman/iStock via Getty Images Plus)Before the United States began vaccinating all infants at birth with the hepatitis B vaccine in 1991, about 18,000 children every year contracted the virus before their 10th birthday — about half of them at birth. About 90% of that subset developed a chronic infection.
In the U.S., one in four children chronically infected with hepatitis B will die prematurely from cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Today, fewer than 1,000 U.S. children or adolescents contract the virus every year — a 95% drop. Fewer than 20 babies are reported infected at birth.
I am a pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist who studies vaccine delivery and policy. Vaccinating babies for hepatitis B at birth remains one of the clearest, most evidence-based ways to keep American children free of this lifelong, deadly infection.
On Sept. 18, 2025, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an independent panel of experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, debated changing the recommendation. According to the proposed language of the vote, infants whose mothers test positive for hepatitis B would still receive the vaccine at birth. Infants whose mothers do not test positive for hepatitis B would get the vaccine at 1 month of age, though parents would have the choice for them to receive it earlier. On Sept. 19, however, the committee tabled the vote, delaying it to the next committee meeting, scheduled for Oct. 22-23.
Although such a proposed change sounds small, it is not based on any new evidence. It would undo more than three decades of a prevention strategy that has nearly eliminated early childhood hepatitis B in the U.S.
While the committee regularly reviews vaccine guidance, nothing is business as usual about this meeting. In June 2025, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. disbanded the entire committee and handpicked new members. The committee has long-standing procedures to evaluate the evidence supporting the risks and benefits of a given vaccine, as well as other parameters of its use. But in this case, these procedures are not being followed.
 
Why the CDC adopted universal hepatitis B shots
Hepatitis B is a virus that infects liver cells, causing inflammation and damage. In adults, it is spread through blood and bodily fluids, which can happen through unprotected sex, contaminated needles or contact with open cuts or sores of someone who is carrying it.
The hepatitis B vaccine has been available since the early 1980s. Before 1991, public health guidance recommended giving newborns and young children the hepatitis B vaccine only if they were at high risk of being infected — for example, if they were born to a mother infected with hepatitis B or living in a household with someone known to have hepatitis B.
That targeted plan failed. Tens of thousands of children were still infected each year.
Some newborns were exposed when their mothers weren’t properly screened or if their mothers got infected late in pregnancy. Children also became infected through household contacts or in child care settings by exposures as ordinary as shared toothbrushes or a bite that breaks the skin. Because hepatitis B can survive for a week on household surfaces, and many carriers are unaware they are infected, even babies and toddlers of uninfected mothers remained at risk.
Recognizing these gaps, in 1991 the CDC recommended hepatitis B vaccination for every child starting at birth, regardless of maternal risk.
 
Vaccinating at birth
The greatest danger for infants contracting hepatitis B is at birth, when contact with a mother’s blood can transmit the virus. Without preventive treatment or vaccination, 70% to 90% of infants born to infected mothers will become infected themselves, and 90% of those infections will become chronic. The infection in these children silently damages their liver, potentially leading to liver cancer and death.
About 80% of parents choose to follow the CDC’s guidance and vaccinate their babies at birth. If the CDC’s recommendations change to delaying the first dose to 1 month old, it would leave babies unprotected during this most vulnerable window, when infection is most likely to lead to chronic infection and silently damage the liver.
The hepatitis B vaccines used in the U.S. have an outstanding safety record. The only confirmed risk is an allergic reaction called anaphylaxis that occurs in roughly 1 in 600,000 doses, and no child has died from such a reaction. Extensive studies show no link to other serious conditions.
The current recommendations are designed to protect every child, including those who slip through gaps in maternal screening or encounter the virus in everyday life. A reversion to the ineffective risk-based approach threatens to erode this critical safety net.

Tamara Taylor has played softball, volleyball and basketball, but tackle football hits different — literally.

This report was originally published by The 19th.

“I just like to hit people and have fun,” said Taylor, 31, defensive lineman for Denver’s Mile High Blaze women’s tackle football team. “When I moved to Denver, that’s when I found out about football in general. … I wouldn’t change it for the world.”
Taylor and players like her are punting football’s traditional gender norms — tackle is for boys and men, flag is for girls and women — with a growing fan base across the country. And the sports world is taking notice: The Women’s Football Alliance (WFA) — home to the Blaze — became the first women’s tackle football league to secure a multiyear network deal with ESPN2, and the league’s national championship has been broadcast on the sports network for the last three years.
This year’s national championship brought in 969,000 total live viewers, making it the most-watched game on ESPN2 that day. The WFA’s St. Louis Slam took home the win against the DC Divas with a final score of 26-14.
The WFA has also announced expansion into Canada this year. The women’s tackle league has partnered with Cosmos Sports & Entertainment, a sports marketing firm based in Ontario, to identify cities in Canada that could host a team.

Lisa King, a former semi-professional soccer player, founded the WFA in 2009. The alliance is the oldest and largest women’s tackle football league in the world. With 60 teams across three divisions, the league has 12 professional teams.
King was interested in playing football throughout her childhood, but her parents denied her opportunity. After graduating from college, she jumped at the chance to play for a women’s tackle football team in Los Angeles. In founding the league, she wanted to use a similar structure as the soccer teams she had excelled in and bring it to women’s tackle football.
Ten years later, in 2019, Odessa Jenkins, a former player for the WFA, expanded opportunities by creating the Women’s National Football Conference (WNFC). Made up of 17 teams, the WNFC may be smaller in size, but has made an impact on the future of women in football by having a robust branding infrastructure in place to amplify the sport, including creative direction. Jenkins, who played and coached for the WFA’s Dallas Elite, aims to expand opportunities for women football players so that they get the level of recognition they deserve.
For the WNFC, this year marks the first time they have broadcast their national championship game on ESPN2. The matchup between the Texas Elite Spartans and Washington Prodigy came with a new high in digital engagement. The broadcast gained 150,000 championship viewers and more than 150,000 followers on Instagram, a 61% increase since 2024. The league’s TikTok account also doubled since last year, with over 46,000 followers.
And ideally, that recognition will come with pay for players — in the WNFC and the WFA. While neither league provides a salary for players, the WNFC does offer prize money to championship teams. With help from sponsorships by brands like Adidas, Dove and Riddell, the WNFC provided players on the championship team with $20,000. The WFA did not provide a monetary prize for the championship, but was able to cover some costs for players.
“It’s truly a pay-to-play type of situation because we’re not paying these wonderful athletes,” said Rob Sandlin, head coach of the Mile High Blaze, who noted that the financial strain and dedication required can be the biggest challenges for players new to the sport. “We try to be as brutally honest as possible when it comes to what to expect. The one thing that most rookies don’t quite understand is the level of dedication that’s required.”
Players must pay dues to remain part of the team, but payment doesn’t guarantee they’ll see time on the field.
“The physical aspects we can explain. The mental parts of the competition can be explained. The idea of how much work you have to put into it is probably the one thing that I get back from people that decide, ‘Yeah, I can’t do this,’ more than anything,” he said.
According to sports news site Marca, the average NFL salary in 2024 was about $3.2 million. While women don’t play for NFL teams, there has been growth in opportunities for women to be on staff. The NFL now has the most full-time women coaches of any professional men’s sports league, with 15 women holding coaching positions across departments.
While girls have access to flag football, a low-contact variant of tackle football, the sport traditionally separates based on gender as young athletes get older. Youth flag football has co-ed opportunities for players ranging from 5 to 17 years old. Tackle football more commonly has restrictions on girls and women playing, both during adolescence and adulthood.
Women’s flag football is seeing growth of its own, with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics announcing that they will have women’s flag football teams competing for the first time. The NFL has also received bids for future investments in women’s professional flag football leagues this year.
Challenges aside, being in a high-contact sport as a woman has proven to be a unique and rewarding experience for these football players, whether they started playing as children with their siblings or discovered tackle as adults.
For Yolanda “YoYo” Searcy, football was etched in her life at a young age. Breaking with tradition, her Florida high school offered her a spot on the all-boys football team.
“The head coach coached all my siblings and was like, ‘I know what you can do,’” she said.
She declined and joined a school-sanctioned flag football team instead. Years later, she got her chance to play with other tackle-loving women as a linebacker with the Mile High Blaze.
Rosa Climaco, who has been an offensive lineman for the WNFC’s Washington Prodigy for three years, feels she could have benefited from finding football earlier. As someone interested in incorporating fitness into her lifestyle, Climaco finds football to be the perfect choice.
“One night scrolling on Instagram at 3 a.m., I found [WFA player] Lois Cook’s Instagram and just started going down the rabbit hole. I’m like, ‘Whoa, there is a legitimate football league that exists for women,’ and really the only regret I have is that I found it when I was 31,” she said.
Some players find that they have to balance the societal expectation for women to curb aggression with the demand for them to play rough to win.
“I personally think there’s caution tape around aggression even still in women’s football,” said Kourtney “KP” Purham, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy. “The idea for men obviously is to be aggressive at its most violent level. One of the things our coach says this year is ‘I support organized violence,’ but it’s like him selling that to us because women are taught not to be that way.”
“So, you’re now trying to navigate through what violence looks like in a sport that was designed for men to be violent and still how to be a lady in a violent sport,” Purham said.

Tapping into aggression comes more naturally to some of these athletes than others. While some players found tackle football to be a place where they could release that side of their personalities, others have had to embrace their aggressive side for the first time.
“A lot of the time for me, it was always, ‘You’re too loud, you’re too rough, you’re too this, you’re too that,’” said Washington Prodigy linebacker and captain Ramzeh Deen-sie.“I was still seeking a way to get out my aggression and just be who I am in my true, natural self.”
Deen-sie describes her transition from playing offense to playing defense as a perfect fit for her personality.
“It was just like, ‘OK, you want me to tackle whoever got the ball. You want me to put my shoulder pads through their chest and make sure they cannot come get you the next play,’” she said. “‘I can do that cause I’m already aggressive, I like to fight, I’m always on 10. I can do this.’”
Tonique’a Jackson, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy, has a much different relationship with aggression. For her, focusing on protecting her teammates has allowed her to move with more force on the field.
“I think trying to find that aggressive part of me, it took a really really long time. If it wasn’t being knocked over, if it wasn’t being tripped up, if it wasn’t being yelled at, it’s like you have to tap into the dog inside of you ’cause it’s either beat or be beaten, and that’s where my aggression comes from,” she said.
Outside of pushing her to explore her self-expression, playing football has also allowed Jackson to carry on a family legacy.
“In 2021, I lost my son to gun violence. He was very big in football, and [it was] something that was really, really important to him,” she said. “I wanted to find a way to not only stay connected to him but to also keep his dream alive because I felt like it was taken from him at such a short time in his life.”
Players say they’re satisfied with the growing recognition for their sport — and their representation in it.
“Just to see now with the progression of us being kind of everywhere, involved in coaching at the high school level, too, we’re getting a lot more fans out,” said Mile High Blaze quarterback Kimberly Santistevan. “Whether they know us directly or they’ve heard of us and they want to see us and check us out … the stands are getting fuller and fuller every year.”

The new film, “In the Wake of Justice Delayed,” follows five years in the families’ search for justice – in two cases of murder of Native women, one more recent murder in Palmer in 2019 and one decades ago in Point Hope in 1985 – and a diving into the interconnected grief and impacts of violence in the ongoing crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people, particularly women, in Alaska.
The film is set to premiere in Alaska with screenings in Anchorage on Sept. 21, and Homer on Sept. 27. It will air nationwide on PBS on Nov. 1. 
The documentary opens with the statement: “Native women and girls experience a murder rate 10 times higher than the national average,” by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
“Women are not just statistics. They are not just numbers,” said Alice Quannik Glenn, a journalist and podcast host from Utgiagvik featured in the film. “They’re real people that influence the other people around them. They influence their communities. So when one of us isn’t safe, it makes us all vulnerable.”
For the Miller family of Teller, pop 249, located about 70 miles outside of Nome, the once tight-knit family was devastated by the murder of their daughter, twin-sister, and mother Mingnuna Bobbi Jean Miller in Palmer in 2019. 
The film follows her twin sister Billi Jean Miller navigating the loss of her twin, as well as their mother, going through the pain of the subsequent five-year trial of her then-boyfriend charged with murder.   
“If I could push one thing, it’d be to know how to advocate for your family,” Miller says in the film. “When she died, I didn’t know how to advocate for her. I would have talked more to the police department or investigator.”
In a phone interview, Miller said sharing Bobbi’s story brings a mix of emotions, but she hopes it will inspire change in how domestic violence incidents – and Native women – are seen and addressed by law enforcement. 
“That shouldn’t have been her story,” she said. 
Miller said her twin sought help from the Palmer Police Department days before her death. “She wanted to come home and you know, they stigmatized her as just a Native woman on drugs, but she wasn’t on drugs. And that’s just the sad reality is that we’re treated differently,” she said. “They should have done their due diligence of helping her, if that’s their profession.”
For the Lane family of Point Hope, population 830, the grown children of Harriet Lane share their grief and outstanding questions of what happened to their mother. 
“I would like to see my mother rest in peace,” her son, Amos Lane said in the film. “Thirty years later, there are still unanswered questions that need to be addressed.”
In 1985, Harriet Lane was tortured, raped and murdered by three men in their community of Point Hope. 
“I don’t know what really happened. But that’s what people say happened,” Amos Lane said, and that it was never properly investigated. “So, that’s brutal.”
The family is continuing to grapple with the pain of her death, and calling for the case to be re-opened and investigated. “To this day, no one’s been charged with a murder,” he said. “Something is wrong.”
“No one should have to deal with this … without any resolution, without any closure, without any justice.” 
The film is the six year project of filmmaker and director Mary Katze and Affinity Films, a non-profit educational media production company based in Anchorage. 
“The story is about what it does to the psychological condition of people who are not acknowledged or believed or see any justice whatsoever,” Katze said in a phone interview. 
The film overlays the personal tragedies in the wider historical background of Alaska’s history of colonization, exploitation of natural resources and violence against Alaska Native communities, including slavery. During Russian colonization of Alaska beginning in the 18th century, the fur traders enslaved Ungangan peoples of the Aleutian Islands to force them to hunt for seals for the lucrative fur trade. The legacy of that violent period has been felt for generations, Tara Bourdukosky of St. Paul Island explains in the film, and continues to be felt today. 
“It is important to want to know, to talk about these things, to find out what actually happened in our past and how we got to be where we are today,” she said.
Katze said it was important to depict the generational trauma and legacies of violence felt by Alaska Native communities today. 
“I’ve been here 40 years, but I’ve never connected how that introduction to our (Western) culture, to our world, was so negative and traumatizing for so many people. And it’s important to understand that that’s the root base of families for generations. So there’s a distrust, and rightfully so, that they’re going to be treated right by this law enforcement. They have their own ways of dealing with murder in in their villages, and that was crushed when they brought in official law enforcement people,” she said. “So understanding that is a foundation to people and culture that has been violated so many times for so long is a big part of understanding the crime rate.”
Miller said she also hopes the film raises awareness about how domestic violence is addressed. “Victims of domestic violence are real people, and the system fails a lot of DV survivors and people that are lost to DV,” she said. “I just hope that there’s a really big impact, and that it brings on a really great change … because it is a crisis.”
Miller said going through the almost six year court process changed her, and sharing her experience in the film was emotional and difficult, but ultimately the family welcomed the verdict and feel they received justice.
“Because a part of me wants to push those feelings under the rug, and then a part of me is just really, really, extremely grateful that Bobbi is important… that she was a real human and that she was so loved,” she said. “I think we’re very fortunate that Bobbi’s story was told, and I think Bobbi’s very fortunate to have received justice for her story. And the process was hard because it was five, almost six years long.”
She said she wants the film to shed light on the Alaska Native families and communities now enduring the search for justice for murdered loved ones.
Currently the number of victims and unsolved cases of missing and murdered Indigenous people in Alaska is unknown. The non-profit Data for Indigenous Justice is putting together its own database of cases, and filed a public records request with the Alaska Department of Public Safety for the list of names of victims and cases investigated, and the state denied their request. 
“I just hope that the audience takes away that these are people that are very much loved, and they deserve better,” Miller said. 
Katze said she also hopes to see changes in the court system, and speedier trials.
“The target audience for this film is future jury members, lawyers, judges, and law enforcement…and then how important it is to support people that are brave enough to come forward,” she said. “And so I hope that Alaskans understand more of their own history, that they understand more on missing and murdered Alaska Native women.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IN-THE-WAKE-OF-JUSTICE-DELAYED-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-09-19 23:57:11.055753

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/ct-unions-pension-connecticut-sun/,"CT's largest state employee union urged Gov. Ned Lamont to focus on overdue wage agreements for public-sector workers, not basketball.","Connecticut’s largest state employee union urged Gov. Ned Lamont late Friday to abandon talks of investing pension assets in the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun and focus on negotiating overdue wage agreements for public-sector workers.
“These members have put their hard-earned money into the pension fund, expecting a secure retirement, not for it to be used on a sports franchise that plays 18 games a year in Connecticut,” Council 4 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in a statement posted to its Facebook page. “We urge the governor to leave the distractions behind and focus on preserving public services and respecting the state employees who provide them every day.”
Lamont earlier this month endorsed the concept of investing pension assets to help keep the team in Connecticut, either at the Mohegan Sun casino, where it currently plays its home games, or at the recently renamed PeoplesBank Arena in downtown Hartford, formerly known as the XL Center.
The Associated Press reported in early August that a group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca reached a deal to buy the Sun from the Mohegan tribe for $325 million and move the team to Boston for the 2027 season.
Though the governor hasn’t said what amount Connecticut might invest to keep the team here, he did say he believes it could be a sound investment.
But Council 4, which represents more than one-quarter of state government’s unionized workforce — more than 12,000 workers across all agencies and departments — disagrees.
State employees “deserve the certainty of a dignified retirement, not the uncertainty of high-stakes investments in political pet projects,” the Facebook post continued. “Their pension contributions are the foundation of a secure retirement that workers have already earned. To use that money on a sports franchise is to gamble with the futures of those who have already sacrificed so much.”
State employee unions granted wage and benefit concessions twice in the decade of the 2010s to help close major budget deficits.
The Lamont administration did not respond to the Council 4 statement immediately after it posted Friday evening.
The Democratic governor’s efforts to retain the Connecticut Sun also has drawn fire from Republican legislative leaders, who this week called the potential investment risky and renewed a proposal for a professional board to oversee future use of pension funds.
Lamont has confirmed some discussions with tribal leaders regarding the Connecticut Sun but discussed few details publicly. The governor has said any infusion of state dollars into the sports franchise likely would be in conjunction with a private investor also interested in keeping the Sun here.
But the union wrote that Lamont has a more pressing, overdue issue to resolve.
Thirty-five bargaining units, representing nearly all unionized workers in state government excluding state police troopers, are working under wage agreements that expired June 30.
The Lamont administration, which has been trying to convince unions to scale back remote work policies established shortly after the coronavirus first struck Connecticut, hasn’t reached any tentative deals on raises yet.
And three units representing judicial staff and a fourth representing correction officers declared contract talks with the administration to be at an impasse earlier this summer. Three of the unions declaring impasse charged the Executive Branch hadn’t offered any raises to date, despite public statements from the governor that he intended to offer wage hikes to all unions.
“We urge the governor to leave the distractions behind and focus on preserving public services and respecting the state employees who provide them every day,” Council 4 added in its post.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/correctionpresser-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 22:56:52.838010

(Photo by Amanda Young/Toolik Field Station)After nearly four decades of connecting Arctic scientists to funding opportunities, research and education projects and each other, the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States held its last community meeting on Friday before a planned Sept. 30 shutdown.
The consortium, founded in 1988, is closing down after losing the National Science Foundation funding that was its major source of revenue.
Audrey Taylor, the organization’s executive director, used the online meeting to explain the ARCUS board’s shutdown recommendation, made this summer.
“The ARCUS that we know and love, what has been ARCUS for the last 35 years, doesn’t have a viable path forward at this time. And so that’s what we’re choosing to sunset,” Taylor said during the online meeting.
The consortium had been coping with reduced funding for the past few years and had already taken cost-cutting steps, like slashing its staff and moving to an entirely online workspace, she said.
The final blow was the Trump administration’s decision to end the National Science Foundation program that had provided most of the consortium’s funding, she said.
Rather than try to keep operating, the board determined that the best option was to close down in an orderly fashion that allows information to be properly archived and, wherever possible, services to be transferred to other management, Taylor said.
“Even though I think I speak on behalf of all of the board and staff that were heartbroken to take this step, we think it’s the most responsible path forward,” she said.
Wendy Warnick, who served as the executive director from 1992 to 2009, said the Trump policies have been particularly devastating.
“We’ve gone through difficult times in the past, but I think what’s happening now is unprecedented,” she said during the meeting. “I hope there’s a way to continue the work that ARCUS has done and to keep this amazing community moving forward as much as possible.”
The consortium had served as a hub for scientists from universities, private entities and public agencies in Alaska, the Lower 48 and internationally. It provided grants and financial support for research projects, supported early career scientists, supported an Indigenous Scholars Program, archived Arctic data and reports and provided other services.
Scientists who participated in ARCUS programs used Friday’s meeting to express gratitude for the past decades’ services.
Larry Hinzman, a former vice chancellor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who now serves as that university’s designated Arctic professor, said the consortium had made Arctic science more relevant and responsive to people who live in the region.
“In the early days, anything we did in Arctic research had to be justified from the importance of why the Arctic was important to the Lower 48. And I think ARCUS really helped us change that perception and made the Arctic important in its own right,” said Hinzman, who served as a science adviser to former President Joe Biden.
Helen Wiggins, who served as executive director from 2019 to 2024 and is now a board member, was a bit tearful as she lauded what she said was the “high standard of excellence” and “amazing level of professionalism” in the organization.
“It’s really about the people, it’s about the focus that I think we’ve had on authentic connections to each other, working together, supporting each other, caring about each other as people,” she said.
Some ARCUS functions will continue outside of the consortium structure.
The Sea Ice Prediction Network, a scientific collaboration that had been established by ARCUS in 2014, will continue operating as its own entity, said Brit Myers, the consortium’s strategic engagement director.
The network, which provides detailed information about ice conditions off Alaska and elsewhere in the Arctic, is supported by the Colorado-based National Snow and Ice Data Center.
The Sea Ice for Walrus Outlook, another scientific collaboration created by ARCUS, is also surviving. That network, which serves Alaska Native subsistence hunters and coastal communities, provides information on spring ice conditions in walrus habitat off Alaska. It is now operated by the Alaska Ocean Observing System, which also monitors harmful algal blooms, salmon habitat conditions and other aspects of Alaska’s marine system.
Both the NSIDC and AOOS are vulnerable to negative impacts from Trump administration policies, however.
The administration earlier this year ended a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data service that the NSIDC was using to track sea ice. The center now uses satellite-derived data from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA.
The administration has also proposed eliminating all funding for the U.S Integrated Ocean Observing System, of which AOOS is a part. That proposal is within the administration’s budget for NOAA, an agency that has already sustained deep cuts that reduced fisheries research, weather monitoring and other services.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NovemberSampling.jpg,,,2025-09-19 22:56:52.838010

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)This year’s Permanent Fund dividend will be $1,000, an amount set by the Alaska Legislature in House Bill 53, the state’s annual operating budget bill, earlier this year.
Ordinarily, lawmakers allocate an amount of money for the dividend, which makes individual payments dependent upon the number of recipients. 
The Alaska Department of Revenue then announces the final amount in September.
This year, lawmakers set a specific dividend amount, which turned the Alaska Department of Revenue’s fall announcement, released Friday, into an anticlimax.
Alaskans whose PFD applications were filed electronically, whose applications were approved as of Sept. 18, and who requested direct deposit, will begin to receive their payments Oct. 2. 
Those whose applications are approved by Oct. 13 will receive their dividends starting Oct. 23.
That includes people who applied for the dividend on paper forms or requested paper checks.
Paying a $1,000 dividend to all recipients was expected to cost $685.3 million, making it one of the largest single expenses in Alaska’s annual state budget.
Only the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development ($1.4 billion) and the Alaska Department of Health ($1.1 billion) are more expensive.
The 2026 dividend is expected to be larger, if lawmakers agree to spend from the state’s Constitutional Budget Reserve. 
Since 2020, lawmakers have approved larger dividends in election years than in non-election years.
The Alaska Permanent Fund, an $83 billion state trust fund, is the largest source of general-purpose revenue for state services, paying for between 50-60% of state operations in an ordinary year. Oil revenue, by comparison, supplies only about a third of state revenue. 
Since 1982, a portion of the fund has been paid out to Alaskans in an annual dividend. The payment was set by formula until 2016, when lawmakers — facing severe budget shortfalls — began setting it by fiat. The formula remains in state law, but legislators are not obliged to follow it.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s three members of Congress differed on a series of votes Friday intended to keep the federal government funded past the end of the month, and avert a government shutdown.
Alaska’s sole U.S. House Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, voted in favor of a seven-week budget extension, but that measure died in the U.S. Senate when lawmakers were unable to garner the 60 votes needed to pass the U.S. House measure or an alternative proposed by Democratic members of the Senate.
U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was absent from both votes. U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted against both proposals.
“I voted against both measures as I felt that they were not serious (enough) to meet the situation that we are currently in today,” she said in a recording provided by her office.
The Republican-controlled House passed its stopgap funding bill 217-212, with one Democrat voting for it and two Republicans voting against it.
“The House did its job,” Begich said in a written statement afterward. “We passed a responsible, short-term continuing resolution to keep the government open and give Congress time to complete the appropriations process. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats chose obstruction over solutions, blocking this clean measure.”
Murkowski and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, voted against the House-passed plan, while Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pennsylvania, voted for it. Eight senators did not vote, and the measure died 44-48.
The Democratic counterproposal failed 47-45.
Murkowski said that counterproposal included “a Christmas list” of Democratic ideas, including items that would have reversed big parts of the Republican “Big Beautiful Bill Act” from earlier this year, which contained core tax cuts and spending policies of Trump’s second presidential term. Murkowski and Sullivan voted for that bill, which was later signed into law.
On the other side of the coin, Murkowski said the Republican plan failed to include an extension of subsidies for health care plans passed through the federal insurance marketplace, something that is critical for Alaskans. It also didn’t include additional funding for public broadcasting or opposition to President Donald Trump’s unilateral budget clawbacks, known as recissions.
“I’m going to be busy in the next 10 days, trying to build a level of consensus that keeps the government open, because there is no side — no Republican, no Democrat, the White House — nobody wins when there is a government shutdown,” she said.
“It’s possible that my proposal will equally annoy both sides, but maybe, just maybe, it will get the conversation going in a way that advances serious discussion and positive outcomes,” Murkowski said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC03285-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 21:56:42.963335

(Photo by Andrii Koval/Getty Images)Maryland’s promise is simple: We leave no one behind. But that promise is easier said than done. It must apply when families gather in houses of worship, when students walk into classrooms, when neighbors gather in community centers — and it must include Jewish Marylanders in our daily lives. Too often, today, it does not.
Sadly, prejudice still exists, and we must fight all forms of bigotry. Maryland’s 250,000 Jews (including myself) are living through a renewed and unnerving time of fear.
Every time Jews gather — for prayer, a holiday meal, or community service — security is on our minds. Congregations hire guards, install surveillance equipment and conduct drills. These steps are necessary, but costly, exhausting and heartbreaking. Worship should not come with a price tag or the constant fear of being targeted simply for being Jewish.
This anxiety is real. Not long ago, my dear friend Sara Milgrim and her boyfriend were murdered as they left the Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. Their deaths were part of a broader trend of rising antisemitism worldwide.
The numbers confirm what we feel. Jews make up only 2% of America’s population, yet according to the FBI Hate Crime Statistics, we are the targets of roughly 70% of all religion-based hate crimes. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reports antisemitic incidents surged from 942 in 2015 to 9,354 in 2024 — an 893% increase in less than a decade.

In Maryland, we ranked fifth per capita for antisemitic incidents last year, with 356 reported — up 227% from 2022. The 2023 State of Maryland Hate Bias Report found religious-based incidents tripled from 2022 to 2023, with Jews making up 28% of all victims even though we are only 4% of the state’s population.
Antisemitism can arrive as physical attacks, but often it starts smaller — online, where allies stay silent. Recently, after I politely called out an antisemitic statement online, someone in Maryland wrote: “Well, people are getting disgusted by the horrific war crimes in Gaza perpetrated on tens of thousands of Palestinians by your notorious leader Netanyahu …”
While some may not realize it, this is deeply antisemitic. I am Jewish, but I am not Israeli. Netanyahu is not my leader. I, like most American Jews (and many Israelis), want hostages freed, the humanitarian situation in Gaza resolved and the war ended.
Should people around the world hate all Americans for Trump’s actions or all Russians for Putin’s? Of course not. Yet Jews are repeatedly scapegoated. Criticism of a government is legitimate; blaming all Jews for it is antisemitism
What happened on Oct. 7, 2023, is another reminder of why vigilance matters. That day’s Hamas terror attack in Israel was the largest mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust. Even today, hostages remain in Gaza. For Jews everywhere, October 7 is now a day of grief and remembrance.
What can Maryland do? First, continue and strengthen security grants so faith and community institutions can keep people safe. Second, strengthen prosecution of hate crimes, ensuring bias-driven violence and harassment face serious consequences. Third, invest in public education campaigns that teach students and communities to recognize and reject antisemitism and other prejudice.
Marylanders who are not Jewish can act, too. Allyship starts with listening, speaking out against antisemitism and other prejudice, and refusing to let stereotypes or silence take root.
When my father was a child in Austria, he witnessed Hitler parade through Vienna. More than 100,000 cheered. Soon, most of our family was killed for being Jewish. We are blessed my father and his parents escaped to America. But we must ensure antisemitism does not come roaring back.
Albert Einstein said, “The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch and do nothing.” One simple start: Recognize Jewish holidays — Rosh Hashanah (Sept. 22–24, 2025), Yom Kippur (Oct. 1–2), Sukkot (Oct. 6–13), October 7 (Day of Remembrance), Shemini Atzeret & Simchat Torah (Oct. 13–15) and Hanukkah (Dec. 14–22) — and avoid scheduling major civic events on those dates. Another is to speak up against hate whenever you see it.
Simple allyship across all marginalized groups sends a powerful message: Maryland leaves no one behind.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/antisemitism-700x445-1.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 20:57:41.192510

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Nearly 300,000 Marylanders who bought health insurance on the state’s Affordable Care Act Marketplace will see monthly health care costs jump next year, as state officials finalize premium rate increases for 2026.
The Maryland Insurance Administration announced the approval Friday of a 13.4% average premium rate increase for 2026, meaning individuals and households will have to pay hundreds more in health costs over next year.
While the approved rates are slightly better than what insurance companies initially asked for earlier this year, it’s still going to be a significant hike in health care costs for families already struggling to pay their bills.
“It’s going to hit patients hard,” said Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, noting that families are already struggling with other expenses. “That’s a significant increase for those who are not getting raises to keep up.”
The Maryland Insurance Administration said that the premium increases will be needed to offset the likely end of federal tax credits that help keep costs down for low- to middle-income Marylanders.
Health advocates, state officials brace for ‘sticker shock’ if ACA tax credits expire

Those tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year and health care advocates fear that people will drop their health care coverage because they can no longer afford their plans.
Matthew Celentano, executive director of the League of Life & Health Insurers of Maryland, agrees that the increase in premiums will reduce enrollment, which impacts costs for all policyholders, not just those covered through the Affordable Care Act.
“Frankly, it’s the healthier people that leave the market. The sick are more expensive, and to cover that cost we have to see higher premiums,” Celentano said.
The insurance administration added that rising medical and pharmaceutical costs also contributed to the higher premium rates.
For this year, insurance companies initially asked for a 17.1% premium increase, but after negotiations with the insurance administration, they landed on an average 13.4% increase for the 294,189 people who have individual ACA health care plans.
Still, that’s more than twice the rate of increase from last year, when individual ACA plan premiums rose an average of 6.2%. The lowest premium rate increase in recent history was in 2022, with just a 2.1% average increase across marketplace plans.
How much more plans will cost for Marylanders will vary based on a person’s insurance carrier, location and household income and size.
For a 40-year-old living in Baltimore with a silver plan, that person could see a monthly increase anywhere from $17 to $75, depending on their carrier, according to state estimates. A family of four in the same situation could see an increase of $57 to $258, on top of their current premiums.
The General Assembly approved funding this year that would partially replace the soon-to-expire federal tax credits for the upcoming year, but those state subsidies are temporary fixes and plenty of people will still pay more each month for health care than they did this year, analysts say.
“With the pending expiration of the enhanced federal tax credits and with the state subsidy only able to partially replace the reduction, consumers may see sizable rate increases, much higher than in recent years,” Insurance Commissioner Marie Grant said in a written statement.
State officials, insurance companies and health advocates are urging Congress to extend premium tax credits, instead of letting them expire in December, though that window is closing.
“This can still be fixed,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Health Care for All coalition. “We really hope that they will do something … if Congress fails, it will hurt Marylanders.”

(Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)Maryland lost another 2,500 federal jobs in August, the second month in a row that the state has led the nation in federal job losses, according to numbers released Friday by the Maryland Department of Labor.
The August numbers brought the  total number of federal jobs lost in the state to 15,100 since January, when President Donald Trump took office and began his campaign to slash the size of the federal workforce. That year-to-date total is also the most in the U.S., the state said.
Maryland’s economy is heavily dependent on the federal workforce: An estimated 269,000 Maryland residents were employed by the federal government in 2023, according to a report by the state’s Labor Department, and there were 158,475 federal jobs located in the state that year.
The August job numbers count jobs located in the state, which means Maryland has lost almost 10% of its federal jobs since the start of the year.
Jake Pannell, a national business representative for the National Federation of Federal Employees, said many former workers have had to leave the region, and he worries about the lack of private-sector jobs for the variety of skillsets federal workers have.
“Many of these people have decades of experience. They’re overqualified for other positions,” Pannell said, adding that some federal workers will either have to accept “huge” pay cuts or undergo job re-entry programs — training them for jobs “they’re already greatly experienced at.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
And the federal job losses are only expected to continue when the September numbers come out. As part of the push to slash the federal workforce, federal employees were offered a deferred resignation option on Jan. 28 that would allow them to receive pay and benefits until Sept. 30.
“Workforce-wide” declines are expected to show up in the job losses at the end of September and through the end of the year as those jobs come off the books, according to a statement from the Office of Personnel Management.
Lawmakers this year created an emergency short-term loan program for laid-off federal workers, and the Labor Department has set up a page for former feds looking for work that includes a list of job recruiting events and career workshops.
“The states are doing everything they have the resources to do,” Pannell said. Many resources put forward by the state, such as unemployment insurance, are federally funded and are at risk of being cut, he added.
“Those resources aren’t going to be any better than they were before,” Pannell said.
The federal job cuts were the driving factor behind an overall loss of 3,200 jobs in Maryland for the month, which drove the state’s unemployment rate from 3.4% in July to 3.6% in August. Still, Maryland’s unemployment rate remained below the national average of 4.3% for the month.
The federal job cuts began on Trump’s first day back in office, when OPM issued a memo directing agencies to identify workers who were still in their probationary period, when it is easier for them to be fired. They continued in February, when Trump ordered reductions in force and agency reorganizations in line with recommendations of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE Service.
Since taking office, Trump has also unilaterally ended collective bargaining agreements with some federal labor unions and instituted a hiring freeze that has been extended through mid-October, among other actions. All told, about 97,000 federal jobs have been lost nationwide since January 2025, according to a Sept. 5 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
“If you get rid of all these federal employees within the state of Maryland or in the D.C. metro area, where are they going to go? What are they going to do? Where are the jobs they could take?” Pannell asked.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-9.39.12 PM-1024x677.png,,,2025-09-19 20:57:41.192510

(FBI photo via X)The Montana Department of Environmental Quality will investigate the circumstances that led to a drug burn sickening a dozen employees at an animal shelter in Billings.
On Sept. 10, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was apparently burning methamphetamine in an incinerator primarily used by the City of Billings Animal Control Operation to burn dead animals.
The City of Billings owns and operates the incinerator, which is in the same building as the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter, a private nonprofit that leases space. The shelter is not operated by the City of Billings, but it does have contracts with the city.
The Billings Police Department has long used the incinerator for burning drugs, according to a Sept. 11 statement by the department.
In an emailed comment Friday, FBI spokesperson Sandra Barker said the agency “routinely uses outside facilities to conduct controlled drug evidence burns” and referred further questions to Billings city officials.
The City of Billings posted a statement on the police department’s Facebook page Thursday afternoon, saying they “regret the incident.” They called the burn an “authorized destruction of illegal drugs” in the statement.
A malfunction — a “negative pressure” issue, according to Billings police — forced meth smoke into the animal shelter on Sept. 10. It was not the first time smoke going into the animal shelter had been an issue, according to a statement from Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter Executive Director Triniti Halverson last week.
The DEQ’s authority in this matter is air quality concerns and the incineration equipment, agency spokesperson Jake Garcin wrote in an email on Thursday.
The permit for the incinerator was given on March 10, 2010, to Billings Animal Control from the DEQ. Prior to that date, the permit was held by the City of Billings Animal Shelter, the permit says.
The incinerator was initially built in 2003 and was permitted by the DEQ then. The permit stipulates that animal remains can be burned and what needs to be done if materials other than animal remains are being burned.
“The Billings Animal Control shall not incinerate/cremate any material other than animal remains and/or any corresponding container unless otherwise approved by the Department,” the permit reads. “Billings Animal Control shall provide written notice to the Department and obtain approval from the Department if material other than what would normally be termed animal remains, or its container, is to be incinerated.”
The DEQ was not informed of any specific burning activities, Garcin said. Since the original permit was issued, management of the incinerator has been done at the county level, with RiverStone Health approved to oversee compliance and submitting annual reports to the state, he added. 
According to a statement from RiverStone Health, doing business as the Yellowstone City-County Health Department, drugs previously incinerated at the facility had been pills and marijuana. RiverStone Health tracks what is being burned at that facility.
“Per our records, Health Department staff never witnessed or explicitly approved of the destruction of methamphetamine,” RiverStone CEO and Yellowstone City-County Health Officer Jonathan Forte wrote in a statement.
In addition to the Sept. 18 City of Billings press release, an emailed letter from RiverStone Health to the city’s animal control office said  an “alternate burn” was approved on Aug. 12, 2025.
“This letter serves as RiverStone Health’s approval for the City of Billings Animal Control Division to burn the materials summarized in the notification letter,” the email reads.
A second Aug. 12 letter posted on Facebook, from Animal Control to RiverStone, said the city had been contacted by the FBI for usage of the incinerator “for disposal of illegal drugs.”
Forte wrote RiverStone Health had “no knowledge” that methamphetamine was going to be burned on Sept. 10. Halverson, the animal shelter’s director, also said she had not been informed they were going to be burning methamphetamine in her statement. 
RiverStone Health, in a statement signed by Forte late Wednesday that it is “actively cooperating” with the DEQ and City of Billings. 
In an email accompanying Forte’s statement, RiverStone spokesperson Casey Page wrote, “Because this is an ongoing investigation, we are not available for further comment at this time.”
In a phone call, Page said the DEQ wants to let the investigation play out before commenting further on questions about what was being burned. The DEQ has only just begun its probe.
“Should DEQ determine that there was a violation, a letter would be issued to the City of Billings Animal Control and they would be allowed an opportunity to respond to that letter,” Garcin wrote. “After assessing all the information, including a response from the City of Billings Animal Control, DEQ would determine its intended path forward on the issue.”
The DEQ said it is also looking into whatever agreement allowed the FBI to burn meth feet from an animal shelter. 
“RiverStone Health is approved by DEQ to perform inspections and compliance oversight of minor sources that hold Montana Air Quality Permits in Yellowstone County, including cremation facilities,” Garcin wrote. “As part of its review of the incident, DEQ will look into the whole situation, including the ‘agreement’ referenced by Billings Animal Control.”
A Sept. 11 statement by the Billings Police Department, which runs the city’s animal control program, said the department and “partner agencies” have “long used the incinerator for narcotics destruction.” 
The regulatory role of the county health department in this situation is to “ensure that the burn occurs within a permitted facility, with an operational incinerator that has been inspected regularly,” Forte wrote.
It was unclear what drugs they were allowed to burn, what they weren’t allowed to burn and what exactly the agreement between Billings Police and Animal Control, the county health department, and any relevant federal agencies for burning drugs was.
The incinerator system in question operates from 1,400 to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit and is a closed-loop system, according to the RiverStone Health statement.
“The equipment utilized also contains specialized afterburners and filtration systems to reduce emissions into the community with no risk to the public’s health when functioning properly,” Forte wrote.
He also laid out what the Health Department’s role in this situation is.
“RiverStone Health is contracted with DEQ to provide local compliance inspections, air quality monitoring, approval of alternative burn permits, and quarterly reports of all activities to DEQ, as part of the Yellowstone Air Quality Control Program,” Forte wrote. “Billings Police Department and the City of Billings followed the established protocols for notifying RiverStone Health environmental health staff of the scheduled burn on September 10, 2025, and it was approved based on the information provided.”

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said states need to be “creative and innovative” in how they think about learning — and don’t need the bureaucracy of Washington, D.C., in the way.
McMahon made her remarks Friday at a roundtable with Gov. Greg Gianforte at Montana State University in Bozeman, the largest public university in the state.
At the roundtable, MSU students and representatives from industry talked about the importance of connecting education with the needs of the private sector and the benefits of the trades at Gallatin College.
“You guys probably know this statistic, but the fastest growing class of millionaires in the country are trade skills,” McMahon said. “So keep working.”
In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that private equity firms were investing in skilled trades and minting a new class of millionaires.
Gianforte, a Bozeman Republican and entrepreneur-turned-politician, said he wanted McMahon to see that Montana is leading the way in innovation. He touted more than 3,000 apprenticeships in various trades in Montana and “record low unemployment.”
The Governor’s Office announced on Friday an unemployment rate of 2.9% in August, “the eleventh straight month under 3% and over four consecutive years of unemployment at or below 3.4%, a new record.”
Gianforte, whose Gianforte Family Foundation made a $50 million donation to MSU to support cybersecurity, optics and photonics, and engineering, said a strong partnership between the private sector and higher education means better outcomes for students.
“That’s why we’ve made such a priority in our administration to align workforce with education, so that our students can have brighter futures and our economy continues to grow, so that people can pursue the American dream,” Gianforte said.
The governor said he appreciates McMahon’s interest in all 50 states to “understand what we face” and to “be a better partner” — and he’s seen progress on the partnership.

Republican President Donald Trump’s appointment of McMahon to head the Department of Education has been controversial and led to legal battles and protests.
Trump charged McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration during his first term and an executive with World Wrestling Entertainment, with shuttering the department in a bid to increase efficiency.
But some education groups and many Democrats argue the plan to dismantle the agency will hurt vulnerable students.
At the roundtable, McMahon said bureaucracy at the federal level — “we don’t hire teachers, we don’t buy books” — should not get in the way of “having more funds flow into the states to get to students.”
“The president certainly believes that every child should have access to a quality education,” McMahon said. “But we need to look at education differently.”
She said innovation means skills-based learning and understanding the needs of businesses. McMahon also said literacy is her top priority.
Courtney Johnson, of Johnson Metal Works in Bozeman, said the company is excited to have a pipeline of students from Gallatin College who meet their workforce needs.
She said some students make six figures right out of school.
“They have nicer trucks than us,” Johnson said.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen, who also participated in the roundtable, said career training is a focus for the Office of Public Instruction too.
For example, she said OPI is sending interactive lesson plans and materials to help teachers teach photonics to elementary and middle school children.
“We are trying to make sure that kids get an early introduction and see these as options,” Hedalen said.
After the roundtable, Hedalen said children get excited about things like light sabers and robotics and lasers, and they excel with the hands-on learning.
She also pointed to one example of a disconnect between a federal regulation and the classroom.
She said Carl Perkins funds for Career and Technical Education can be used only for permanent items such as machinery or tools — but the money can’t be used to buy wood in shop class.
“Obviously, for the student to complete a project in wood shop, you need the lumber,” Hedalen said.
At the close of the discussion, MSU President Brock Tessman presented McMahon with a special pin.
He said the pins are reserved only for the executive team and “guests who’ve shown exemplary partnership and support for our university.”
“You’re our first external guest to receive this,” said Tessman, who took the helm of the flagship this summer.
Pointing to a painting of the headwaters of the Missouri River, Tessman said he thinks of MSU as the headwaters of the state’s future, rural America’s future and the future of the country.
“This is a special time for this campus,” Tessman said. “We’re bursting at the seams because of the innovation and the partnership that you learned a little bit about around this table.”



Hedalen: ‘Montana knows what’s best’
Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen confirmed Friday federal funds for education in Montana remain intact.
Hedalen, who took office in January, also said she backs President Donald Trump’s vision of removing bureaucracy in the Department of Education and the ensuing staff reductions there.
“Montana knows what’s best for our students, and returning more control and funding directly to the state is a step in the right direction,” Hedalen said.

Hedalen spoke to the Daily Montanan following an education roundtable at Montana State University that included Gov. Greg Gianforte, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, and MSU President Brock Tessman.
Hedalen also said she spoke one-on-one with McMahon during her visit, and the secretary was engaged and interested to hear about the needs of Montana.
The superintendent said she shared the way Montana uses technology to ensure rural students have opportunities and discussed how to meet needs in a state with one-room schoolhouses.
She said she and McMahon both share an interest in early literacy as a priority.
Hedalen said McMahon understands the importance of special education and appreciates the work of paraprofessionals, and Hedalen said she herself does not anticipate changes to special education funding — which would take an act of Congress.
Hedalen also said she does not intend to buck the Trump administration’s cuts to education — but she is prepared to advocate for Montana schools and funding streams that are critical.
She said it’s important to peel out a layer of bureaucracy as McMahon has argued in order to focus on the needs of Montana and reduce red tape — filling out reports takes time, she said, and there’s a cost to it.
“I want our administrators to be able to be instructional leaders rather than filling out paperwork and reports,” Hedalen said.
She also said she’s advocating for other funding, such as state funding, to help English learners. Hedalen said Montana is one of the few states that doesn’t put money into English learning.
She said partnerships with business and industry can help when it comes to funding too.
Even with staff reductions at the department, Hedalen said Montana educators continue to have open lines of communication with their federal managers, and she herself will continue to advocate for students in the Treasure State.
“We know our schools and what they need best, especially with the rural nature and demographics of Montana,” Hedalen said.

After superintendent warns of harm to students from ""slurs, symbols, and discriminatory behavior,” parents and community members criticize administration for inaction.

Photo by Carly Berlin/VTDigger and Vermont Public
Three weeks into the new school year, an 11-year-old Northfield middle school student has already faced multiple instances of harassment, according to his mother, who has reported the incidents to the school administration. 
And it’s just one instance in an apparent pattern of harassment and recent acts of hate across the Central Vermont Supervisory Union.
“My child has been harassed, going on three years now,” said the Northfield parent, who asked not to be identified for fear of her son facing retaliation in a community that residents and community leaders say is grappling with racism, harassment and bullying.
The parent said her son is a trans student who is trying to find his identity and just started attending middle school in Northfield. When he was in elementary school, his mother reported to administrators instances of another student harassing him, she said. But that information was never passed on to staff at the middle school, she said. The student who harassed the boy the past two years is now in his class again, and the harassment continues.
The harassment has included “a lot of misgendering” and being called  “a whore and a slut,” she said.
Superintendent Matthew Fedders from the Central Vermont Supervisory Union — which includes six schools in East Barre, Northfield, Washington and Williamstown — put out a letter on Sept. 12 to the community outlining a spike in hate in schools, without naming any particular incidents. 
In it, he pledged more support to students and families who are being harmed, and he called on families to “partner with us by discussing these issues openly at home and helping children understand the harm caused by slurs, symbols, and discriminatory behavior.”“These acts are unacceptable. While they may appear ‘isolated’ to some, their impact is not. For those directly targeted, they are painful reminders that hate can surface even in spaces that should be safe,” Fedders wrote.
Two days later, a group of anonymous residents responded with an open letter alleging the district is not just failing to take adequate measures to combat hate but “has given hate fertile soil in which to grow” by “consistently refusing” to name and denounce specific instances.
The letter states that students in the district have been called the N-word, trannies, sluts, whores and Black monkeys, and swastikas have been drawn on school buses and in restrooms. 
It further alleges that children of color have received “harsher discipline than their white peers” in the district and “disabled children have had their legal rights denied to them by the very educators who are tasked with upholding them,” the letter states. The letter did not provide specifics or evidence about the incidents. 
Fedders’ office said Thursday the superintendent was unable to respond to questions about the criticisms from the concerned residents outlined in the letter that VTDigger forwarded.
“He is also unable to comment on the letter from ‘Disappointed members of the Northfield community,’ as we have not yet received it,” Alysha Sickles, his executive assistant, wrote in an email.
Lack of follow up
The parent of the Northfield trans student, formerly a paraeducator in the Northfield school system, is among about two dozen residents who stand behind the unsigned community letter that has been shared via email and on social media. VTDigger has confirmed that at least five Northfield residents support the letter.
Also among them is Ryan Harlow, a Northfield resident and after-school administrator at the middle and high school, who has consistently spoken up at board meetings about the district’s inaction regarding harassment.
“The visible response from school leadership following each of these events has been mostly invisible from the perspective of non-administrator observers in the community and public,” reads the letter he submitted to the Paine Mountain School District that represents the towns of Northfield and Williamstown.
“As I have flagged before, there has been a throwing up of hands while administrators cite privacy concerns or scapegoat political figures on the national level. But there has been no apparent effort to ‘get out in front’ of issues in a way that would lead to community healing.  Individual discipline seems to happen at times, but teachable moments are habitually missed at the community level,” reads the letter he shared with VTDigger.
Although restrictions under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prevent him from discussing particular cases, Harlow, whose job puts him in close contact with students and parents, confirmed the Northfield parent and her son have been reporting negative incidents “for years” without adequate responses from Northfield schools. He said the Central Valley School District fails to consistently keep track of and document an affected student’s experiences and needs.
“It is exceedingly rare for me to be proactively given any heads up about a student’s disciplinary history, their history as a victim of hazing, harassment, and bullying,” he said. This extends to students who are on an Individualized Education Program, which outlines their special education service plans and relevant medical history. 
“This information siloing has been a point of frustration for others as well,” he added.
Northfield resident Kelly Murch said her family has been “personally impacted by these problems.” In her public comment, delivered remotely via video call at the Paine Mountain board meeting Sept. 17, she asked the superintendent and board to provide “guidance and resources” to better equip school staff to discuss these issues with students.
“I think it would be great if there were specific resources offered publicly from the district to families as well, who might be interested in starting anti racist work in their own household,” she said.
Principals in the six-school district did not respond immediately to requests for comment this week.
‘Words alone are not enough’
Both letters were discussed this week in the Paine Mountain School District’s board meeting, which is part of the consolidated Central Vermont Supervisory Union.
Dan Morris, the board’s chair, said in his statement that the board “does not accept or tolerate racist, bigoted, or hateful acts in our schools” and is “deeply troubled” by the recent instances of homophobia, transphobia and hate outlined in the anonymous residents’ letter. He said he believes communities need to hear a “clear statement” on “these very troubling developments.”
The instances of hate “have a very real negative impact,” he said, and the board is committed to “eradicating hateful, bigoted, and racist language and imagery from our buildings.”
“Students can’t learn when histories of widespread violence against their demographic group are displayed in front of them. They can’t learn when they are constantly getting the message that they are inferior and unwelcome. They can’t learn when they are made to constantly feel unsafe,” he said in the personal statement that he shared with VTDigger.
Staff outlined training and restorative justice circles conducted by schools in response to hate and harassment in an effort to “demonstrate the positive.” They said conversations this week have encouraged middle and high school students to discuss the kinds of harassment, bullying and negative language and actions they are experiencing, seeing or hearing about.
“It doesn’t feel to me like now is the time for restorative circles and education,” said Danielle Moffatt, a Paine Mountain board member. Students know when they use certain words and engage in bad behavior, she said, calling for stronger measures to dissuade them.
“Those words have been wrong since they were 5 and you’re in high school. So I’m thinking that the reason they’re doing it is because the consequence is not strong enough to disincentivize the behavior,” Moffatt said.
Mia Schultz, president of the Rutland Area NAACP, also called for action.
“While the superintendent’s letter names the problem, the Northfield community is right to point out that words alone are not enough,” Schultz said.
“If we are serious about protecting children, schools must move past statements and into action,” she said, centering the most impacted families and students in shaping solutions.
This includes clear accountability when harm happens, robust education about racism, antisemitism and ableism, and the hiring and retention of educators who reflect the diversity of our communities, she added.
The parent of the trans student said she has not seen that level of accountability nor a victim-centered approach for her son in past years. If anything, the opposite is true. 
“What they did in the elementary school was they had my child come up with a plan on how to support them in their gender identity,” she said.
After she informed the middle school about the past and the ongoing harassment her son continues to face, school leaders initiated a hazing, harassment and bullying investigation that determined this week the reported harassment was substantiated, she said.
“I hope that something will change,” the parent said. “There just needs to be more education and using these opportunities to have a teaching moment … to have school wide assemblies and say, ‘This is what’s happening right now.’”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderATLANTA —  A key vaccine advisory panel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indefinitely postponed a controversial change to guidelines on administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborn babies, and altered long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults, though a proposal to require prescriptions for all individuals seeking the shot narrowly failed. 
The panel also voted to reverse a decision they made only yesterday that would have prevented updated guidelines on the MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, from applying to children enrolled in the Vaccines for Children program. 
CDC vaccine panel votes to limit use of a childhood vaccine as COVID, hepatitis B decisions loom

Vaccines for Children is a federal program which covers the cost of vaccines for more than half of American children. The decision to implement different standards for children enrolled in VFC caused confusion among top health officials as well as some committee members when it was introduced Thursday. 
Jason Goldman, the president of the American College of Physicians who also serves as a liaison to the committee, criticized Thursday’s vote, arguing that the changes were not backed by scientific evidence. 
“Would you consider that the second vote actually revealed the truth, that you do not have the data or evidence to challenge the current standing and that there is no associated harm?” Goldman asked the committee.
The committee’s reversal on Friday standardizes the updated MMRV vaccine recommendations for all children. If ACIP’s recommendations are approved by CDC officials, doctors will be required to administer separate MMR and varicella vaccines for all children under 4 years of age.
ACIP tables a rule delaying Hepatitis B vaccine for newborns
In what appeared to be another reversal, the panel shelved a resolution that sought to alter current CDC recommendations around hepatitis B vaccines for newborn children. 
The current three-dose series for hepatitis B, an incurable viral infection that attacks the liver, includes one vaccine administered to infants within 24 hours of birth, and subsequent booster shots given a month and six months after the initial dose. ACIP has been recommending a hepatitis B vaccine for all babies within a day of being born since 1991, which resulted in a 99% drop in serious infections between 1990 and 2019.
CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

If ACIP members choose to implement the changes at a later meeting, official CDC guidelines will recommend that pediatricians delay administering the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until 30 days after birth for all children whose mothers test negative for the disease.
The panel did not provide any evidence indicating that delaying the vaccine improved children’s health, or that there were any widespread or serious instances of harm caused by administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborns. However, some ACIP members also cast doubt on the accuracy of data showing the shot is safe.
“I think that there are gaps in what we know and understand about the effects of hepatitis B, particularly on very young infants,” said Vicky Pebsworth, a committee member who is a registered nurse and who sits on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, which advocates for vaccine exemptions. “I think that the conclusion that we know that it is safe is, perhaps, premature.” 
Dr. Adam Langer, who serves as the principal deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention, urged the panel to reconsider narrowing the recommendations.
“One of the primary reasons for recommending universal birth dose in the U.S. is to serve as a safety net for infants born to mothers with unknown test results,” Langer said during his presentation to the committee on Thursday. 
“To date, no country in the world has reverted from universal to selective birth dose recommendations,” he added.
The meeting, which was held at the CDC’s Chamblee campus, also inspired a demonstration organized by a group of former CDC workers, who dressed up as preventable diseases and waved signs to the passing cars while the meeting was underway. 
Cindy Weinbaum, who retired from the CDC in 2021, said Friday that it was commendable that the committee skipped a vote that would have recommended babies not be vaccinated for hepatitis B within a day after being born, which is the current standard. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder
Cindy Weinbaum, who spent about a decade of her career at the CDC in the division of viral hepatitis, said she commended the committee for deciding to table a vote that would have changed the recommendations for hepatitis B vaccinations.
“I think it’s really commendable, actually, that they delayed this vote because they do not know the implications of not recommending a birth dose of hepatitis B,” Weinbaum said.
“So that was a nod to their lack of understanding of vaccine programs, vaccine science and the importance of certain vaccinations for kids,” she added.
Weinbaum said the proposal’s appearance on the committee’s agenda reflects the “vaccine nihilism that the current administration is supporting.” She said the shot given to newborns within the first day of their life has found itself in the “cross hairs of the anti-vax movement.”
“It’s because here’s this newborn baby and you’re very vulnerable, and sticking it with a needle is kind of a scary thing,” she said. “They just don’t understand that it’s even more scary to get liver cancer, and that’s really what we want to prevent.”
ACIP moves to center vaccine harm
Though the committee did not implement some of its more controversial proposals, ACIP’s new members have signaled that they would like to place a greater focus on examples of vaccine harm and adverse outcomes in future policy proposals.
They have also rejected widely embraced data on vaccine safety, choosing instead to focus on isolated cases and dubious studies, including one paper claiming that rats exposed to the COVID-19 vaccine exhibited “autism-like behaviors” that was eventually retracted by the journal that published it.
Some ACIP members, including Robert Malone, also pushed back against guidelines that advise vaccinating young children and pregnant women, arguing that there is a lack of data proving definitively that vaccines are safe. 
“The default should be the assumption that there is no intervention in the infant and the pregnant woman with the vaccine unless there is definitive evidence of safety,” Malone said.
But Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Dartmouth College who has served as a past committee member, pushed back against the argument that any medical intervention should be entirely risk-free.
“I just want to point out that it’s very, very difficult to prove the absence of harm, it’s simply not a practical objective,” Meissner said.
“I think it’s important for everyone to understand that no vaccine is 100% safe and no vaccine is 100% effective,” he added. “What’s important for the provider before administering a vaccine is to think about that particular patient and does the benefit of protection exceed any possible side effect from the vaccine.”

But in a conversation with reporters after the meeting, Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, signaled that the committee could revisit other vaccine recommendations in future meetings.
“I think we need to review vaccines, in general, from time to time,” Levi said. “It’s part of a good process. I don’t think that I need now to single out one vaccine or another. I think that, in general, it’s actually in the mission of ACIP. . . to actually review every vaccine.”

Photo credit: Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon with the Atlanta Civic Circle An immigration judge ordered Spanish-language journalist Mario Guevara to be deported on Friday despite a pending First Amendment case in federal court, setting off a frenzied attempt by his attorneys to stop the deportation from happening. 
Guevara was arrested earlier this summer while covering an anti-ICE protest in DeKalb County. His arrest has alarmed free speech advocates and attracted national attention. 
Friday’s ruling relies on a 2012 order stemming from Guevara’s request for asylum in 2005. While his request was initially denied, the case was administratively closed on appeal which paused deportation proceedings against Guevara indefinitely, but not permanently. The new order concluded that a previous immigration judge was prohibited from issuing Guevara bond in July due to that order.
Sandy Springs Democratic state Sen. Josh McLaurin, who is also an attorney, spoke against the immigration judge’s decision at a hastily called press conference Friday. 
“I want to make something clear. This is not a court in the traditional sense. This is not the judiciary with Senate-confirmed judges. The Board of Immigration Affairs is an executive agency with judges appointed by other executive officials that are responsible to the Trump administration. So make no mistake, this is not an isolated incident. This is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to silence and chill journalists for doing their jobs,” McLaurin said.
Following the immigration judge’s ruling this year, that 2012 deportation case was reopened, enabling Guevara’s deportation to now happen at any moment. 
Guevara’s attorneys had also been trying to argue in federal court that his continued detention by ICE is illegal on First Amendment grounds. Guevara’s legal team, led by the ACLU of Georgia, is seeking a restraining order preventing the federal government from deporting Guevara while this case is still pending in federal court. 
An emergency hearing was called in that case late Friday afternoon. While supporters had hoped a restraining order would be granted immediately, the judge instead requested attorneys on both sides to submit additional briefs by next week. It’s unclear if federal authorities will attempt to deport Guevara while the restraining order is still pending.
Guevara was arrested on June 14. He was transferred into ICE custody from the DeKalb County Jail under the terms of a controversial 2024 Georgia immigration law. 
Originally from El Salvador, Guevara has lived and worked legally in the United States for the past 20 years, according to his attorneys. He fled El Salvador for fear of political violence due to his work as a journalist. A longtime journalist for Spanish-language outlet Mundo Hispanico, he founded his own newsroom, MGNews, in 2024.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)MOBRIDGE — Days before the end of her term, the first woman elected chair of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said South Dakota leaders could learn something from their neighbors to the north.
Janet Alkire, a U.S. Air Force veteran, twice served as the tribe’s executive director before being elected as chairwoman in 2021. 
On Friday at the Grand River Resort near Mobridge, she told the South Dakota State-Tribal Relations Committee she’ll continue to work “from afar” for her people. 
The tribe of 16,000 members — 11,000 of whom live on the reservation that spans the border of North and South Dakota — will elect a chair, vice chair, and eight tribal council members Wednesday. 
Cabinet office with tribal leaders helps in North Dakota
Standing Rock members are “tri-citizens,” Alkire said, of the tribe, the states and the federal government. Because Standing Rock straddles two states, that means Alkire and other tribal leaders have six members of Congress to lobby.
“I’m pretty sure they’re tired of us, because we visit them a lot,” Alkire said.
Standing Rock leaders raise concerns about federal funding in meeting with ND, SD governors

On Friday, she told State-Tribal Relations Committee members that trust and relationships between the state and tribes hinge on frequent and respectful communication.
Committee member Scott Odenbach, the Republican House majority leader from Spearfish, wanted to know if he and his counterparts in state government could learn anything from North Dakota’s approach to working with tribes. 
Communication is the prime place for improvement with South Dakota, Alkire said. 
The state’s annual legislative sessions offer more opportunities to engage with lawmakers and pursue legislation than in North Dakota, where lawmakers meet every other year. But North Dakota has an Indian Affairs Commission that facilitates year-round connections.
“We actually meet with them quite often, because they’re coming out of the governor’s office and they’re right there at the Legislature, monitoring what’s going on,” Alkire said.
That commission includes North Dakota’s governor, the leaders of North Dakota’s tribes and three at-large members, two of whom must be Native American. The office also has an executive director and three other full-time staff members.
Standing Rock Council Member Cyril Archambault is the tribe’s North Dakota legislative liaison. He’s in frequent contact with commission members on legislation. The commission meets quarterly, holds at least two training sessions for tribes each year and holds spot events as needed.
South Dakota has similar entities, including the committee that met Friday and the Department of Tribal Relations, but Archambault said the comparison ends there.
“I don’t see much commitment from South Dakota. I’ll just be honest,” he said.
Standing Rock chair stresses building unity and infrastructure

Nola Taken Alive, another Standing Rock council member in attendance Friday, noted that her tribe has a healthy relationship with North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong.
South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden has met with Standing Rock leaders, which Taken Alive said signaled potential improvement in relations.
His predecessor, current U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, had a strained relationship with tribes. Taken Alive attributed what she described as “friction” between Noem and tribes to “blatant disrespect, at times” from Noem. She pointed to comments Noem made last year about drug cartels allegedly operating on reservations. All nine tribal governments voted to ban Noem from their lands last year, for those comments and for saying Native American children “don’t have any hope.”
“With Governor Armstrong, he’s always reaching out,” Taken Alive said of North Dakota’s leader. “That’s a healthy relationship.”
Federal outreach to continue
Alkire noted that Standing Rock and South Dakota’s other tribal nations face similar challenges with law enforcement and health care funding. Standing Rock needs 30 officers, for example, but only has funding enough for 10.
Changes to Medicare and Medicaid embedded in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed this summer by Congress, she said, will ripple across state and tribal borders.
“The tribes in South Dakota, all nine of them, realize that the relationships that we have with the state are very important,” Alkire said.
During a break in the committee meeting, Alkire told South Dakota Searchlight that the ascension of former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to Interior secretary offers another avenue to maximize the impact of tribal issues in Washington, D.C.
Standing Rock had a working relationship with Burgum, who intends to maintain the secretary’s Tribal Advisory Committee. Alkire represented the Great Plains for former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on her version of the committee.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also intends to maintain such a committee. That has Alkire hopeful, as well.
“That is the best line of communication,” she said. “I mean, they can communicate within their agencies, but you need to hear the perspective of the tribes.”
As for her plan after she leaves office, Alkire said it can be summed up in one word.
“Rest,” she said.

For North Carolinians, that means remembering that voters split tickets and that it’s routine for Democrats and Republicans to win statewide elections.
“North Carolina was purple before purple was a thing,” said Brinson Bell, who participated Friday in an online forum on trust in elections sponsored by the media organization Votebeat.
“We had one of the most conservative U.S. senators in Jesse Helms serving at the same time as one of the more progressive governors that North Carolina has ever had in Jim Hunt,” she said. “That just speaks to North Carolina voters.”
In 2020, when Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump, Republicans in every state were “grumpy” about elections, with Republicans in states where Trump narrowly lost a bit more unhappy than the rest, said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at MIT. At the same time, Democrats “believed election officials could do no wrong,” he said. 
“Distrust in elections is more likely to be driven by national rather than local events,” he said.

Polls found that Republicans’ confidence in election results increased after Trump won last year, 
But Seth Bluestein, a Republican on the three-member commission that runs elections in Philadelphia, said he feared that trust is not sustainable. 
Trump made unsupported claims last year about cheating in Philadelphia, which officials had to refute, Bluestein said. Once the polls closed and it was clear Trump won the state, those accusations stopped.
National leaders need to “tone down the rhetoric,” he said. 
“What I see is the national rhetoric from party leaders filtering down and being repeated by legislators, who are then trying to pass laws that will actually make election integrity worse, or make it harder for elections officials to run the elections at the county level,” Bluestein said. 
Brinson Bell noted that she started her tenure as North Carolina elections director after a ballot harvesting scandal in a congressional race and ended it with a candidate for state Supreme Court refusing to concede his narrow loss. She was talking about Republican Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin, though she did not mention him by name.
“The transparency was there, the data was there, people could understand that this election had been conducted fairly, yet the candidate did not concede until May of 2025,” she said.
Griffin had challenged more than 60,000 votes, many because he claimed voters did not included required identification numbers on their voter registration forms. After the case meandered through state and federal courts, a federal district judge said the effort to throw out votes was unconstitutional and ordered Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs, a Democrat, be certified as the winner.
The US Department of Justice sued the Board of Elections this year over the missing voter registration identifiers. Elections officials are working to collect the numbers from voters. The DOJ and the state settled the case.
Though confidence in elections is rising, there are now more grassroots groups that profit from fomenting dissatisfaction than there were in 2020, Stewart said. 
“Even if confidence gets better, there’s the rest of the process that leads to the chaos that we observe,” Stewart said. “I think the situation is kind of dicey these days.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Voting-booths-Getty.jpg,,,2025-09-19 18:57:31.119591

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine led the country in enshrining the “right to food” in its state constitution. But the subjugation of the Wabanaki Nations has complicated that right for the original inhabitants of the land.
Anthony Sutton, assistant professor of Native American Programs and Cooperative Extension at the University of Maine, highlighted the differences between the traditional ways Indigenous communities use natural resources for food and cultural practices and the state’s current food sovereignty laws during his keynote speech at the Common Ground Fair in Unity on Friday.
“If we’re going to do the work of food sovereignty seriously, we need to recognize the rights that are allowed and the ones that aren’t,” said Sutton, who is also a faculty fellow of the university’s Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions. 
In 2021, Maine became the first state to establish a right to food in its state constitution when voters approved an amendment by referendum. This right is defined as the ability of all people to “grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being.” 
The amendment built on the state’s food sovereignty law passed in 2017, which lets municipalities adopt ordinances that exempt local and direct producer-to-consumer food sales from some state regulations. 
When Maine established these rights, Sutton said his Passamaquoddy mentor Ed Basset asked: What does this mean for tribal sustenance? 
The Wabanaki Nations – the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation – are treated differently than other federally recognized tribes. This is because of a 1980 land settlement agreement that has left them with a relationship to the state more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations.  
The Tribes have been pushing for legislative changes that recognize the Wabanaki Nations’ inherent rights to self-governance, economic development and resource management for years. But Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has so far rejected overhauling the agreement and instead approved some piecemeal adjustments on a case-by-case basis.
While Maine’s food freedom policies allow municipalities to manage local food businesses as a form of economic security, Sutton pointed out that the municipal distinction given to Wabanaki governments has had negative impacts. 
Candidates’ support signals tribal rights may be a top issue for Maine’s next governor

A 2022 Harvard Kennedy School study concluded that the Wabanaki Nations’ inability to self-govern has stunted economic growth, both their own and the state’s. 
Definitions are key when considering the impacts of state laws on tribal rights, Sutton said. 
From the state of Maine’s perspective, sustenance means, “if I grab a fish out of the Unity stream with my bare hands, because that’s how I fish,” Sutton said jokingly, “and I put it on my table for my family, that’s sustenance.”
But Sutton said that definition oversimplifies sustenance and avoids the complex ways people of different backgrounds access and use food. That way of defining sustenance also has consequences for the broader idea of food sovereignty.
“We talk about rights, and if we do that, we must talk about ways to ensure those rights are met across a range of geographies by everyone in substantive and meaningful ways,” Sutton said. 
For example, Maine’s food sovereignty legislation centers small-scale “traditional” farming.
“Whose notion of traditional are we using?” Sutton questioned. “If we’re going to go real tradition, we would start with our creation stories, the stories that not only teach us skills, but the values and knowledge needed for caretaking.”
Municipal boundaries are another complicating factor when assessing tribal sustenance under the state’s food freedom laws, Sutton said. 
While these policies support local food production within municipal boundaries, he explained that many Wabanaki foodways require movement that transcends such artificial boundaries. 
“It’s the movement between those places and the knowledge systems that makes growing and distributing corn possible today, though Maine’s sovereignty legislation isn’t particularly good at dealing with movement,” Sutton said. 
Land disposition also plays a role, as the Wabanaki Nations today have ownership over only a fraction of the land they originated. 
“In short, non-Indigenous management systems are not good at thinking about the future — five, 10, 20 years, maybe, sure,” Sutton said. “But in Wabanaki notions of care, we’re considering how we act shapes the future abilities for our grandchildren’s grandchildren to be in relation with the land and water, which is something that we can all benefit from.”
The Maine Legislature is expected to consider another omnibus tribal sovereignty bill when lawmakers reconvene in January. That legislation aims to adopt the recommendations from the task force the state convened to study the settlement act in 2019. Several suggestions included changes that would provide the Wabanaki Nations with the authority to restrict hunting and fishing by non-tribal citizens on tribal lands.
Another bill that will be up for debate would provide an exception to Penobscot Nation citizens to prohibitions against buying, selling or offering for sale certain wild animals and wild birds.
Lawmakers could also consider a proposal to send another constitutional amendment to the voters to establish the right to hunt and fish. The chambers couldn’t agree on it this year and the bill was ultimately carried over into the next session.

(Photo by Don Kruse for the Florida Phoenix).TAMPA — Local government officials throughout Florida should be among the most interested viewers tuning into the Florida Channel next week when the House Select Committee on Property Taxes convenes for the first time in months in Tallahassee.
Some of those concerns — and excitement — about the still-unwritten plan promoted to substantially reduce or eliminate property taxes for Florida homeowners was discussed at the Tampa Tiger Bay meeting on Friday.
The challenge for local public officials debating a likely constitutional amendment to that effect on next year’s ballot in Florida is that no one knows exactly what the proposal will call for.
All options on the table
“Do you think the constitutional amendment will give the either/or, so if we do away with property taxes for homesteaded properties that at the same time we’ll have a choice to make on how that happens?” Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Bob Henriquez asked state Rep. Berny Jacques (R-Seminole). “Or do you think the complete proposal includes some form of backfill?”
“It’s too early to say one way or another,” Jacques responded. “All options are on the table.”
Jacques went on to say that not every local government was the same in Florida in terms of how reliant they are on property taxes to fund essential services. He mentioned that Largo — a city he represents — brought in $239 million in revenues last fiscal year, with only $39 million from ad valorem property taxes. And only 23% of that revenue was from homestead properties.
“I think that they can do just fine, especially when they look under the hood and make key priorities about what’s necessary and what’s not.”
However, some municipalities and counties in Florida rely heavily on property taxes to run substantial parts of their  local governments.
“I look under the hood in the city of Tampa, our crime’s the lowest it’s been in decades,” said Tampa City Councilman Alan Clendenin. “This is not accidental, because we’ve had the investment in crime prevention in our police and our first responders.”
According to Tampa Mayor Jane Castor’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget, every dollar of Tampa’s $380 million in property tax revenue is allocated to police and fire services.
Hillsborough County Commissioner Josh Wostal is a supporter of providing tax relief to owners of homesteaded properties in Florida. He floated his own proposal to get rid of all property taxes in the county and make up the loss of revenue by raising the sales tax in the county by 3.5%. He said the part of that could be subsidized by visitors.
“About 20-30% of people who [pay sales taxes] don’t even live here. That’s free money,” he said. “That’s relief for the fixed-income senior citizens and low-income citizens that own property that yes, while the more affluent people feel the sting of property taxes the most, the poor people and mixed-income citizens feel the burden the most because it’s ever increasing and inescapable. You can choose not to pay a sales tax. You cannot choose not to pay a property tax. “
However, state legislators working on the proposal say that a complete elimination of property taxes – while espoused on the campaign trail by Gov. Ron DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia – is not on the table.
“We can certainly talk about it,” said Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City, co-chair of the select committee on property tax, told Spectrum News this week. “However, the direction’s that been given to me at this point in time is that the total elimination of property tax is not something that we would likely be putting forward in a constitutional amendment.”
‘A Tallahassee grab’?
No one on the panel was more critical of the proposal to reduce property taxes than Clendenin, a longtime Florida member of the Democratic National Committee. He said that it was absolutely critical that it fail at the ballot next year “because it will so adversely impact our first responders and the security and safety of our community and our state.”

But he received serious pushback by Jacques, who rejected Clendenin’s assertion that it was “a Tallahassee grab to seize power so that your local officials are no longer accountable to the citizens.”
“This idea that this is kind of a grab from the state — nothing could be further from the truth. If anything, it’s empowering to people of the state,” said Jacques, referring to the fact that it will be the voters who decide.
“If that’s a power grab, then I guess I don’t know the definition of that, because you’re giving the people the choice,” he added.
Meanwhile, Rep. Ryan Chamberlain, R-Belleview, like Jacques a member of the House committee assigned to figure out what the proposed amendment on property taxes will look like, proposed his own “Freedom 1,2,3” proposal to reporters earlier this week.
“There is a political risk for me or anyone else who rolls out an actual plan, because immediately, there’s going to be those who organize opposition,” Chamberlin said. “It’s easy to talk about doing something about property taxes without ever getting specific about doing anything about it. But I’m convinced that we must have a starting point.”
Although local officials are critical of the idea, Gov. DeSantis and CFO Ingoglia continue to campaign around the state for the proposal. In Ingoglia’s case, his DOGE auditing team has been scrutinizing spending by some of the state’s biggest cities and counties and calling them out for what he alleges is unnecessary spending.
This week alone, Ingoglia travelled to Jacksonville and Orange County, where he accused both of those local governments of “wasting” $200 million and $190 million, respectively (local officials disagreed). The CFO said its important to call those local officials out now, so that they don’t start complaining next year that a reduction in property taxes will force cuts would devastate public safety and other essential services.
The House Select Committee on Property Taxes is scheduled to meet Monday at noon in the Capitol.

This week, he was granted further reprieve from deportation, according to Kitson. (Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Antonio Chairez Rios has spent the last three months living in Albuquerque with an ankle monitor, a daily reminder that at any moment he could be deported to Mexico amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push.
But yesterday, when he arrived for his scheduled check-in at the field office of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, agents instead removed the ankle monitor. Then they informed him that he only needed to check in once a year going forward, according to his lawyer Rebecca Kitson, instead of the appointments every month or so.
His emergence from the ICE field office marks at least the second time in several months that he’s dramatically avoided deportation. In early June, more than 100 protesters scheduled a last-minute demonstration outside the office, chanting “Keep Antonio here!” as Chairez Rios and his lawyer met with ICE agents.  
ICE offers Albuquerque immigrant reprieve — for now

Kitson told Source New Mexico on Friday that the grandfather of two, who has lived in Albuquerque for 20 years, was spared deportation this time around due to last-minute legal wrangling that ensured a federal official reviewed Chairez Rios’ long-pending visa application. 
The review found that Chairez Rios was likely to succeed in his quest for a “T visa,” given to immigrants who suffered human trafficking, which meant he received deferred action on the government’s efforts to deport him and an approved work permit, Kitson said. 
The approvals occurred a day or two before his scheduled ICE visit, which Kitson called “a nail biter.” Chairez Rios spent this week getting his affairs in order, expecting that he would be deported, she said. That meant figuring out where he could live, how to transfer title for his truck and connecting his bank accounts to Mexico, she said. 
“ICE had indicated to us that it wasn’t their intention to remove him,” Kitson said. “But I don’t really know how much anybody can rely on that type of assertion these days, especially with the pressure to complete the quotas.”
New Mexico probation officers accused of referring ‘problem’ probationers to ICE for deportation

Kitson credited Chairez Rios for continuing to show up to ICE check-ins despite the threat of deportation, and she also reiterated her gratitude to the protesters who waited for three hours in the hot sun back in June. 
“It took a village to make it happen, but one starfish is back in the ocean, at least for now,” Kitson said. 
But she is troubled to think of how many people have been deported during ICE check-ins in Albuquerque, New Mexico and across the country. And she’s distressed that lawyers like her were required to force the government to do its job, including the timely review of visa applications. 
“It shouldn’t be that there’s a different standard for those who have representation. It shouldn’t be that someone is only released when there’s someone there to see it,” she said. “It makes me worry about everybody else.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9652-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 18:57:31.119591

State and county reviews found that Capt. Jason Gray was justified in his use of force in the incident that has resulted in a suspect facing attempted murder charges for firing on him.

File photo by K. Fiegenbaum/VTDigger.
A St. Johnsbury police captain who exchanged fire with a suspect won’t face any criminal charges in connection with the incident, according to the Vermont Attorney General’s Office. The suspect shot and injured the officer, who shot at the suspect but did not hit him.
The shooting that injured Capt. Jason Gray took place Dec. 13 in an apartment building in St. Johnsbury where police said they were investigating a report of domestic assault.
The Vermont Attorney General’s Office reviewed Gray’s use of force in firing back at the suspect, Scott Mason, and in a press release Thursday announced that they had determined that Gray’s actions were justified. 
“Under the totality of these circumstances,” the release stated, “both during and leading up to the shooting, an objectively reasonable officer in Captain Gray’s position would have concluded that there was no other reasonable alternative than the use of deadly force to prevent his death or serious bodily injury.”
Windham County State’s Attorney Steven Brown also declined to prosecute the case after completing his own independent review, according to the release.
Brown served as conflict counsel on behalf of the Caledonia County State’s Attorney’s Office in conducting the review.
About a day and a half following the shooting, police captured Mason in an apartment building near the one where the incident took place. 
Mason pleaded not guilty late last year to multiple charges, including attempted murder, in connection with the shooting of Gray. He remains in custody awaiting trial.
Gray had gone to Mason’s residence in a multi-unit apartment building as part of a domestic violence investigation. Gray walked up a flight of stairs with a fellow officer following him, according to a summary of the incident provided by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office. 
Seconds later, a round of pellet shots hit Gray as he was in the hallway. The other officer and the reported domestic violence victim fled, the summary stated. 
“Captain Gray then retreated behind a doorframe, drew his firearm, and peered down the hallway to locate the shooter when a second round of pellet shot hit Captain Gray,” according to the summary. 
“Simultaneously,” the summary added, “during this second round of pellet shots, Captain Gray discharged one bullet from his firearm in the direction of the shooter, but it did not strike the shooter or any other person.”
Gray then collapsed from his injuries, the summary stated, and while he was on the floor, he saw Mason carrying a shotgun. 
“Scott Mason approached Captain Gray and yelled, ‘get the [expletive] out,’ before fleeing the house through a second-floor window,” according to the summary. 
The search for Mason prompted the state to issue its first ever Blue Alert, which is used to inform the public of an ongoing search for someone suspected of injuring or killing a police officer.
After the shooting, an officer drove Gray by police car to Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital. Gray was later taken to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, for treatment of his extensive, but non-fatal injuries.
Gray has since retired from the St. Johnsbury police department, Town Manager Chad Whitehead said Friday in an email.
“The Town is pleased at the AG’s findings, and would not have expected any different outcome,” Whitehead added.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Most of the 308,662 Arkansans covered by the six health plans will not see the full rate increase thanks to subsidies offered by the federal Affordable Care Act, the release states. But those subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn’t act to extend them. 
ACA marketplace insurers are increasing premiums by an average of 20% in 2026, according to an August KFF analysis.
Centene manages three of the six Arkansas health plans: QualChoice, QCA Health and Celtics Insurance. Arkansas BlueCross BlueShield manages the other three plans: Health Advantage, USAble Mutual and USAble HMO.
The two parent companies initially proposed raising their premiums by 54.4% and 25.5%, respectively. Sanders asked Arkansas Insurance Commissioner Alan McClain to reject the proposals, saying she did not want insurance companies to “take advantage of our people.”
In the news release, Sanders said she negotiated with the two parent companies to propose lower rate hikes, which will go into effect Jan. 1 with approval from interim Insurance Commissioner Jimmy Harris. McClain left the position Sept. 1 to take a consulting job.
Five of the six plans will have lower premium increases than initially projected, with the exception of QualChoice Life. On average, the six plans’ increases are 35.6% lower than initially projected, according to the press release.
“More work remains, but this is a good starting point and shows that when we stand up to insurance companies, we can win tangible benefits for the people of our state,” Sanders said in the news release.
Permanent extension of federal health care subsidies estimated to cost $350 billion

In Washington D.C., congressional Democrats have been urging Republicans to extend the enhanced tax credits for certain people who buy their health insurance through the ACA marketplace. Democrats included the tax credits in a 2021 COVID-19 relief package and extended them in 2022.
Concerns about prices spiking during the open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1, have brought the issue of extending the tax credits to the forefront ahead of the Oct. 1 government shutdown deadline.
Passing an extension before Oct. 1 would decrease 2026 insurance premiums by 2.4% compared to previous projections, Congressional Budget Office Director Phillip Swagel wrote to federal lawmakers Thursday.
Permanently extending the tax credits would cost the government $350 billion over 10 years and insure 3.8 million more people, Swagel wrote.

New analysis reflects discussions with pro-feeding Wyoming, and the particulars will likely resemble the proposal expected soon from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife. 
The post Feds provide peek at National Elk Refuge plan: Keep feeding bison, cut off elk at 7% CWD appeared first on WyoFile .","There’s no saying what exactly the National Elk Refuge will propose when it rolls out its long-awaited plan detailing how it will handle a deadly disease forecasted to drastically reduce Jackson Hole elk populations, crushing hunting opportunities in the process. 
But a new scientific analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey provides a first glimpse of likely components in the refuge’s “preferred” option for dealing with chronic wasting disease on a 25,000-acre federal property where thousands of elk have been fed and unnaturally bunched up since 1912. Specifically, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may roll out a proposal that calls for perpetual feeding of the Jackson Bison Herd, a species that’s immune to CWD. For the Jackson Elk Herd, meanwhile, feeding would continue until rates of always-lethal chronic wasting disease reach 7%. 
The USGS analysis predicts what will happen if the refuge opts for increased hunting and a 7% CWD threshold for determining when to stop feeding elk. By year 20 of CWD spreading in the herd, rates of the disease will reach an estimated 25%. The population will fall as a result, declining 26% to an estimated 8,100 animals. 
Paul Cross, the USGS research biologist who authored the report, described the particulars of so-called “Alternative D” as a “middle ground.” The assessment supplemented an earlier, broader analysis that uses science to help the National Elk Refuge chart the best path forward. 
Elk are fed in close quarters on the National Elk Refuge. (Angus M. Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)
Elk feeding began more than a century ago and has successfully increased winter survival and kept wapiti out of winter haylines, but the practice is considered antiquated, spreads disease, truncates migrations and poses an unprecedented threat to elk populations because of just-arrived CWD, which is always lethal. 
The particulars of “Alternative D” were selected based on discussions with wildlife managers, Cross said, naming the National Elk Refuge and Wyoming Game and Fish Department. 
Notably, Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish director, now oversees the poorly resourced Wildlife Refuge System that includes the National Elk Refuge. He was confirmed as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife director in early August. 
The forecast for “Alternative D” is more favorable for elk and elk hunters than if the National Elk Refuge goes with unchanged feeding. In the earlier analysis, that prognosis was for CWD to infect 35% of the Jackson Elk Herd, a rate that modeling predicts would slash the population by more than half, down to 5,200 animals.
The modeling assumed starting points of 11,000 elk and 1% CWD prevalence, both higher than the on-the-ground conditions today.
Elk fare similar under “Alternative D” to the herd’s prognosis if the refuge were to stop feeding cold turkey, the analysis shows. But the newly modeled scenario performs better in other respects, Cross said. 
“If you don’t feed, then [elk and bison] are going to be in other places more often,” Cross said. “That results in more calls to Wyoming Game and Fish, more complaints, more elk running around with volleyball nets on their head.”

The Fish and Wildlife Service did not authorize National Elk Refuge staff to give an interview for this story. 
It’s not entirely clear when the refuge will release its final Bison and Elk Management Plan, although its website says this fall. The current plan dates to 2007, and mostly hasn’t worked to achieve one of its major goals: reducing elk feeding by 50%. It’s also unclear how much the “preferred alternative” in the forthcoming environmental impact statement will differ from the “Alternative D” assessed by USGS. 
“They’ve changed multiple times already,” Cross said. “I don’t know if conversations are ongoing or not.” 
There are elements of “Alternative D” that the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has supported, said Brad Hovinga, who supervises the agency’s Jackson Region. 
“We were definitely supportive of continued feeding of bison,” Hovinga said.
There are still ongoing discussions about chronic wasting disease thresholds that could idle alfalfa trucks on the National Elk Refuge, Hovinga said. Game and Fish in a general sense will be pushing for an option that’s “more in line” with its state-level feedground management plan, he said. 
“That’s been our goal all along,” Hovinga said. 
Wyoming’s first-ever feedground plan, completed in 2024, does not compel reform or call for closing any feedgrounds, though it allows for halting feeding so long as consensus is reached with traditionally pro-feeding parties, like ranchers and hunting outfitters. 
The chronic wasting disease threshold for stopping elk feeding included in the recent analysis was not chosen arbitrarily, Cross said. The threshold was based on 2016 research. That study concluded that animals gathered on the National Elk Refuge will be pushed into a state of population decline once CWD prevalence in cows reaches 7%.

(Photo by Taylor Thomas/Nishnabotna Water Defenders)The eyes of dead fish and the message “know what you drink” adorn a new billboard near Avoca that urges Iowans to monitor nitrate levels in their water. 
The billboard is the first of several that the Nishnabotna Water Defenders, a nonprofit organization advocating for water quality in southwest Iowa, plan to install. 
The group formed in March 2025, a year after a couple hundred thousand gallons of fertilizer polluted the East Nishnabotna River and resulted in more than 750,000 dead fish. 
Terry Langan, co-president of the organization, said the purpose of the billboards is to inform locals of what is in their water, alert them to the free nitrate testing kits available from the Izaak Walton League of America and to key them in on other water quality issues in the region.

“We don’t want people to be poisoned; we don’t want people to have rising cancer rates,” Langan said. 
Izaak Walton League’s Nitrate Watch program equips citizens with nitrate test strips so they can test and report the levels in the streams around them. According to the citizen-scientist data, nitrate levels in the Nishnabotna rivers exceeded concentrations of 10 milligrams per liter at various points this year.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency holds that concentrations above 10 mg/L can cause adverse health effects, specifically an illness known as blue-baby syndrome, which can be fatal to infants.
Some research, however, has found that exposure at even lower levels could be linked to preterm birth and low birth weights and certain types of cancer. 
Water quality experts have said the high concentrations in the rivers this summer is linked to the heavy rains this year that followed years of drought conditions. Scientists in a comprehensive study of water quality in Polk County predicted that climate change will cause more of these weather patterns. 
The report, in correlation with a lawn watering ban in Des Moines and surrounding communities due to high nitrate concentrations in the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, have generated greater awareness of nitrate pollution in the water. 
“I think a lot of people operate under the assumption that everything was cool and the water is great, and it’s not,” Langan said. “That’s becoming very well known.” 
The report from Polk County pointed to agriculture as the primary contributor to nitrate pollution in the river. Langan said Iowans are “suffering” from the “corporate capture” the agricultural industry has in Iowa. 
Scott Kovarovics, the executive director at the Izaak Walton League of America, said in a press release that nitrate pollution is a “serious” problem in Iowa, but also in other communities across the country. 
“When local groups put up billboards along the highway, you know they are not just concerned— they’re fed up,” Kovarovics said of the Nishnabotna group’s actions.
In addition to the partnership with Izaak Walton League to provide nitrate testing kits, Langan said Nishnabotna Water Defenders is working to raise funds to provide testing kits for other water pollutants that are also impacting the watershed. 
The first billboard is located on U.S. Highway 59, outside of Avoca. Jodi Reese, Nishnabota Water Defender’s secretary, said the group chose that location because it’s near the Flying J gas station that spilled petroleum into the nearby West Nishnabotna River. 
Reese said the billboard highlights the “habitat death” of these spills and gets “people to think about what they’re drinking and what’s going on with their water.” 
The group’s next billboard is slated to go up near Shenandoah, which – prior to the heavy rains this summer – had been under water conservation orders for more than a year. That billboard is also near Clarinda, where an algal bloom in the Nodaway River recently contaminated the city’s water supply.
“This level of violence against the environment is not sustainable,” Langan said. “There are universal laws that are being violated. We’re going to end up – on this trajectory – in a wasteland.” 
Langan hopes the billboards can extend beyond the Nishnabotna watershed and pop up in communities across the state. The group is hosting an event Oct. 12 in Red Oak to raise funds for additional water testing materials and the billboard initiative. 
“There’s nothing more ubiquitous than water,” Langan said. “There’s nothing more sacred to us and more of a necessity – it literally runs through our bodies and through our neighborhoods.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a press release Friday that two Taiwanese agricultural industry groups signed letters of intent to purchase Arkansas and U.S. products on the same day.
The Taiwan Feed Industry committed to purchasing 8.5 million metric tons of corn and corn products, while the Taiwan Vegetable Oil Manufacturers Association will purchase 6.5 metric tons of soybeans.
“Today’s announcement is great news for Arkansas and especially our row crop farmers, who need all the assistance they can get right now,” Sanders said in the release.
Between 2025 and 2029, the Taiwanese groups will purchase agricultural products worth at least $5.56 billion from Arkansas and other American suppliers, the release said. Final prices will be negotiated by the importers themselves, the governor said, making it unclear how much would actually be paid.
Arkansans paying millions more in tariff costs compared to 2024

The announcement comes at a particularly precarious time for one of Arkansas’ largest industries, which is facing its worst period in years as a result of depressed crop commodity prices compounded by less-than-ideal weather and tariffs implemented by the Trump administration.
Some state agriculture experts, such as the Agriculture Council of Arkansas and Democratic Senate hopeful and farmer Hallie Shoffner, are warning of impending disaster if more isn’t done to help farms — a third of which could shutter by next year without assistance, according to reporting from Talk Business and Politics. Farmer and GOP state Sen. Blake Johnson of Corning, has also said he believes 20-30% of farmers could close their doors by year’s end without help.
Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman, who chairs the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, has said he is working to get federal relief money for the state’s farmers.
Taiwan is already one of the largest markets for American and Arkansas agricultural products, according to Sanders’ release. Arkansas exported roughly $63.2 million to the country in 2024.

(Reader submitted photo)  State officials announced Friday they have begun testing seafood from the Tangipahoa River and Lake Pontchartrain to look for potential contamination after the explosion and fire at the Smitty’s Supply Inc. facility last month. 
The joint effort from the Wildlife and Fisheries, Health and Environmental Quality departments began Thursday, according to a LDEQ news release. Officials are collecting samples from various locations and analyzing them for heavy metals – such as arsenic, chromium, barium and lead – and petroleum-related hydrocarbons. Control samples of the same species will also be collected from Bayou Lacombe, an unaffected waterway. 
Results from Thursday’s testing are expected to take about two weeks, the agency said. A second round will follow in 60 days, with more testing planned if required to confirm whether the fish, shrimp and crabs are accumulating any toxins. 
The health department and partner agencies will use the results to assess any potential public health risks and determine if seafood consumption advisories are warranted.
Cleanup and decontamination efforts continue in Tangipahoa Parish nearly a month after petrochemical storage tanks exploded at the Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland and caused a fire that burned for about two weeks. The company processes and sells oils, lubricants, fluids and acids for various industrial and automotive applications.  
The explosion dispersed an oily residue onto neighboring homes, businesses and a nearby elementary school, while petrochemicals spilled into area waterways. An oil slick was visible on the surface of the Tangipahoa River, stretching roughly 45 miles south of the facility, LDEQ documents show.

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published by the Valley News on Sept. 18.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — After recent testing showed lower levels of toxic fumes in the air, the Hartford School Board has voted to reopen 12 classrooms that Hartford High School had discontinued using.
In June, air quality tests showed high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, better known as PCBs, in classrooms located in the high school’s B wing. Two of the 12 classrooms that were tested showed that the level of PCBs exceeded the “immediate action level” for occupation, as defined by state law.
Despite not being tested, the 10 other classrooms were closed, because they fit a similar profile to the two that exceeded the “immediate action level,” according to the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation. They were built with similar types of construction materials known to contain PCBs, including caulk.


PCBs were banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1979 because they can cause damage to the body’s nervous, immune, reproductive and endocrine systems, among other health effects. In 2021, the state Legislature passed Act 74, which mandated testing in response to concerns about the legacy of toxic chemicals.

The affected rooms had previously been designated to be at the “school action level,” where students and educators are allowed to use the space, albeit for a limited amount of time each day.
The decision at Wednesday night’s meeting was based on results from testing in the classrooms at the start of the school year.
Hartford School District Director of Facilities Jonathan Garthwaite reported that all of the classrooms that were retested had lower levels of PCBs in the air than they did in June.
“We’ve had higher concentrations in the air” when there are higher humidity levels and temperatures, Garthwaite said during the School Board meeting.
“I think it is safe to say we can expect that trend to continue,” he said. “We have higher readings when it’s warmer and we have lower readings when it’s cooler.”
School Board member Kevin “Coach” Christie, who participated in the meeting remotely, asked Garthwaite how much control the district’s HVAC system has of keeping temperatures in classrooms at levels necessary to minimize the amount of PCBs in the air.
“Frankly … nobody knows what (the temperature) is,” Garthwaite said. “We know there’s a correlation between temperature, relative humidity and airborne concentration, but it’s a correlation.”
The high school is running its ventilation systems “as hard as we can,” he said. “We can’t do anymore.”
The high school does not have an air conditioning system, he added.
With the loss of 12 classrooms, Hartford School District administrators moved educators to different spaces. While they made it work, it was not ideal, Hartford High School Principal Nelson Fogg said during Wednesday night’s meeting. Teacher and student advisory groups had to share space.
There are also 21 teachers teaching who are forced to change classrooms throughout the day, which can impinge on instructional time.
“Our staff are getting to their rooms just as or after students are,” Fogg said. “Our teachers are telling us they’ve struggled to build a classroom community as they move from space to space.”
Before voting, School Board member Cathy Lemire asked Fogg if any staff members had approached him with concerns about reoccupying the 12 classrooms.
“Our staff has not suggested in any way that they’re concerned about moving back into them,” Fogg said. “I would suggest quite the opposite.”
Foil tape installed as a remediation measure over PCB containing building materials by the State of Vermont in Hartford Area Career and Technology Center’s Health Sciences has made no improvement in the levels of the chemicals found through routine testing, said the school district’s Director of Facilities Jonathan Garthwaite in White River Junction on Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025.

The $6.4 million shooting range, which is open to the public, is the largest skeet and trap range in the state, said Tom Mullikin, director of the Department of Natural Resources, during a Friday ribbon cutting.
State officials put $750,000 into building the range, which has been under construction since 2022. Federal funds from the Wildlife Restoration Program, which is meant to preserve and manage wild animals, made up the remaining $5.7 million, according to the natural resources department.
The Boyd Foundation, a Columbia-based nonprofit, chipped in another $200,000 for equipment, according to the department.
The 780-acre range will be open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays. Every 30 clay pigeons a person shoots will cost $5, according to the department.
The shooting range, about 25 miles south of Columbia, is meant to be a space for new shooters to learn the sport, for longtime marksmen to practice their skills, and for educational groups to take lessons, Mullikin said.
The nearby Wateree Shooting Range will transition to offering only sporting clays, making the new range the only one of the seven state-operated shooting ranges to offer skeet and trap shooting.
The new State Skeet and Trap Facility is also large enough to host the state’s skeet shooting tournament. High schoolers will use it for competitions, while middle schoolers will compete at Wateree.

Around 760 students across the state participate in the Department of Natural Resources’ Scholastic Clay Target Sports program, which culminates in championship tournaments, according to the agency.
Ten years ago, Maj. Billy Downer, who oversees the department’s staff operations, visited the property for a hunt with other veterans and military families.
While firing on the shooting range of what was then private property, he asked Michael Love, whose family had owned the property for years, “What are you going to do with this place?”
“I don’t know,” Love replied.
The two started brainstorming, and Love decided he wanted to see the property become a publicly owned shooting range, Downer said. The state bought the land the next year.
The Love family’s legacy will live on as part of the shooting range’s name, Downer said.
“I hope and pray we’re going to share that legacy with thousands of young people and other people in South Carolina that can enjoy this place,” Downer said.

Safety and community are foremost goals at the state’s shooting ranges, Mullikin said. He envisions the range as a place where parents can bring their children to learn the basics of handling and shooting guns. More experienced hunters will be able to give pointers to people who are just starting out, Mullikin said.
Trained range safety officers will monitor the eight fields, and a classroom will allow staff to teach 4H clubs, women’s hunting groups and any other organizations interested in learning the proper and safe way to handle guns, Mullikin said.
“We’ll create a culture where safety is normal, mentorship is normal, and stewardship is a standard,” Mullikin said.
For children, especially, the range represents a way of getting outdoors and finding a hobby not involving screens, said Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette.
The state’s public ranges are generally cheaper than private ranges, according to the natural resources department.
For example, the National Wild Turkey Federation charges $60 for 100 clays at its shooting facility in Edgefield.
“We need to get our kids out of the house and away from video games and putting their phones down and getting back to fishing and hunting and shooting,” Evette said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The University of Florida rescinded a retired professor’s emeritus status Friday, the university announced, over a Facebook post the evening of Charlie Kirk’s death that garnered social media backlash.
The university posted to social media Friday that “a retired faculty member who issued a post on social media that is raising concerns” had lost emeritus status. In a followup, the university did not confirm to the Phoenix who the professor was. The Gainesville Sun reported that it had confirmed the professor in question is retired UF law professor Jeffrey Harrison.
The professor, on his public Facebook profile, posted the night of the day Kirk was killed:
“There is a lot of commentary about Charlie Kirk. It’s not that complicated. He was a evil person spounting [sic] all kinds of hateful messages. I did not want him to die. I reserve that wish for Trump. But let’s face it, even members of the Gestapo and guards at the concentration camps had children. That does not make them heros [sic], nor does it make Charlie Kirk someone to be admired,” he continued.
The post was still up at the time the Phoenix started writing this story; however, before the story published and after a reporter messaged Harrison requesting an interview, his profile disappeared.
Scott Presler, a conservative activist with 2.3 million followers on X, posted to that social media platform Thursday calling for the professor to “lose any affiliation w/ UF & any current duties.”
Thursday, Harrison posted, “I am  getting a lot of hateful commentary about a recent post in which I did not want Charlie Kirk to die but it would be fine with me if Trump did. The latter sentiment i have seen on Facebook scores of times. This avalanche of hate came after someone reposted my original post on X. This leads me to ask if X has gone over, even more than Facebook, to Trumpers?” This post, too, is no longer publicly available.

According to UF regulations, the emeritus title is “conferred in recognition of meritorious service, and it shall entail continued campus courtesies … including parking, use of the library and recreation facilities, admission to athletics and cultural events, receipt of such publications as are sent to regular faculty members and members of the Alumni Association, participation in contract and grant endeavors, and participation in academic convocations.”
The retired professor is no longer listed on the Levin College of Law list of emeritus faculty.
Harrison wrote in The Gainesville Sun a guest column in 2022 that criticized UF administrators who “cowered” to Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Teachers among those answering to employers after Charlie Kirk social media posts

The rescinded emeritus status follows warnings from Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas and State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues promising accountability for educators “celebrating or excusing campus violence.”
The University of Miami, Florida Atlantic University, and now UF have been subject of attention regarding professors’ social media posts since Kirk’s death.
Various K-12 teachers have been under investigation, too, as the Phoenix previously reported.
Friday, Miami-Dade public schools confirmed to the Phoenix that it has received five allegations against employees for inappropriate conduct on social media or in the classroom related to Kirk’s death. Those allegations are under investigation, the district said.

Amber Herzmann, 44, who worked at hospitals in Clinton and West Des Moines, recently reached a settlement agreement on disciplinary charges brought by the Iowa Board of Nursing.
According to the board, Herzmann was working at an Iowa hospital in early 2024 when it was reported that she was stealing medications, including Oxycodone and fentanyl, from multiple patients.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Herzmann was criminally charged with nine felony counts of prohibited acts involving controlled substances and one count of tampering with records. Prosecutors, who allege she stole the medications from maternity patients at Clinton’s Mercy Hospital, recently agreed to a plea deal, although court records provide conflicting information as to the specifics.
Herzmann’s signed plea deal indicates she has pleaded guilty to a single count of tampering with records, while the court order related to that plea suggests she has pleaded guilty to one count each of tampering with records and prohibited acts. She is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 2, 2025.
That case is one of two pending criminal matters involving Herzmann. Twenty days before the criminal charges were filed in the Clinton County case, Herzmann was charged in Dallas County with 13 counts of felony prohibited acts and 13 counts of tampering with records. In that case, police allege that Herzmann, while working on the maternity floor at UnityPoint Health’s Methodist West Hospital in West Des Moines, stole fentanyl belonging to numerous patients.
Methodist West later reported a loss of 14 vials of fentanyl and two syringes of hydromorphone, classifying the loss as a potential theft, according to state records.
Dallas County prosecutors recently agreed to a plea deal in which Herzmann has pleaded guilty to two counts each of felony prohibited acts and tampering with records. She is expected to be sentenced on Oct. 3, 2025, one day after her sentencing in the Clinton County case.
In 2024, the Board of Nursing filed disciplinary charges against Herzmann as a result of the Dallas County thefts, but settled the matter in March of this year by requiring Herzmann to enroll in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program, which assists nurses with substance abuse issues.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Herzmann, who now lives in Erie, Ill., for comment.

Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) being removed from his House Appropriations Committee post after he voted against the bill. July 24, 2025 | Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceAs Michigan budget negotiations between the Republican-led House of Representatives and the Democratic-led Senate continue with 12 days left until a government shutdown, the heads of several state agencies are speaking out, warning that cuts within the House’s $78.5 billion proposal could severely impact their operations.
Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity Director Susan Corbin was among the latest to criticize the House’s budget, noting the proposal slashes 47% from the department’s current budget. 
“These drastic cuts to budget and staffing will create a ripple effect across Michigan’s economy and the programs people depend on.” Corbin said in a statement on Thursday. “Reductions in resources mean fewer protections and safety nets, fewer jobs, and fewer opportunities for hardworking Michiganders.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Corbin pointed to several potential impacts from the cuts in funding, including a loss of $130 million in federal spending authority for the unemployment insurance agency. She also warned of severe cuts to Michigan’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration and drastic reductions in funding for both Michigan Rehabilitation Services and the Bureau of Services for Blind Persons.
“In a time of national economic uncertainty brought on by federal tariffs, these cuts would not only cause immediate job losses, but they would also create long-term economic harm for families and businesses across the state,” Corbin said.
Col. James F. Grady II, director of the Michigan Department of State Police, said the $40.2 million in budget cuts and the equivalent of  297.5 full time positions for post operations.
In a statement, Grady said the cuts would leave the department without sufficient funding to run trooper recruit schools and would require them to examine ways to reduce spending, including cutting trooper overtime, implementing vehicle and mileage restrictions and enacting potential layoffs from the trooper recruit school that will graduate in November.
Grady also pointed to the end of funding for the Secure Cities Partnership, eliminating trooper assignment to high-crime areas, and dedicated crime data analytics and aviation support to cities around the state experiencing violent crime.
“At a time when law enforcement needs more support in terms of personnel and training, this budget takes a major step backward in defunding these priorities,” Grady said. “As budget negotiations continue, I hope they will reconsider their position and make public safety a priority.”
In addition to the state police’s concerns, Elizabeth Hertel, the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said the $4.95 billion in proposed cuts would drastically affect their ability to protect the health, safety and security of Michigan families. 
With the House budget eliminating more than 1,600 full time equivalent positions in the department, Hertel said the proposal would lead to fewer child protective services workers investigating abuse and neglect complaints, fewer disease specialists responding to public health threats and fewer staffers investigating fraud, waste and abuse.
David Q. Worthams, the chair of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission warned that if the House’s budget becomes law, its staff would be cut by more than half, bringing back long delays and major backlogs in investigating civil rights complaints.
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

Phil Roos, the director of the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said the proposal is “simply irresponsible,” and would undermine EGLE’s ability to protect the state from pollution and potentially prompting the termination of critical public health and safety roles in areas like drinking water inspection, air quality permitting and contaminated site cleanup.
Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Director Tim Boring said the proposal slashes the department’s total budget by a third, including significant cuts to food safety work, emergency response and preparedness and customer service operations.
“At a time when our federal partners are pushing for state governments to pick up the load, the House budget plan defunds our basic functions that help Michigan farmers continue operations, keep Michiganders safe from illness, and more,” Boring said.   
Despite heavy criticism, state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, defended the House budget. 
“State department heads rushed out statements to protect the bureaucracies they run while House Republicans are standing with taxpayers,” Bollin said in a statement “Our priorities are simple and unambiguous: strengthen classrooms for every child, keep our communities safe, and fix Michigan roads. This budget stops funding failed programs and layers of bureaucracy that do not deliver results and returns those dollars to visible priorities that improve everyday life.”
However members of the Michigan Democratic Party have already begun targeting Republicans in vulnerable districts across the state over proposed cuts to police and health care. 
“Republicans in Lansing have again failed to stand up for the communities they represent,” House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) said in a statement. “Through this door-to-door program, we’ll hold these lawmakers accountable and make sure every voter in their district knows where they stand – and it’s to kick Michiganders off their healthcare and defund the Michigan State Police.”
In addition to a door knocking campaign, the party has already begun running ads against state Reps. Jamie Thompson (R-Brownstown), Rylee Linting (R-Grosse Ile Township), Steve Frisbie (R-Battle Creek), Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson), Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills), Ron Robinson (R-Utica), Nancy DeBoer (R-Holland) Timmy Beson (R-Bay City) and Karl Bohnak (R-Deerton).

The other 21 states “offered declarations from their respective agency officials, who explain that having SNAP funds withheld is likely to require them to cut staffing and otherwise greatly reduce their ability to comply with their obligations under the SNAP Act to administer benefits, including, for example, the speed with which applications can be reviewed and required reports can be prepared,” the court’s ruling said.
“No such declaration, however, was filed by any official on behalf of the State of Nevada.”
As a result the “State of Nevada, as of August 12, 2025, had fully complied with the USDA’s request for SNAP data,” says the order issued Thursday by the Northern District of California. The motion from the attorneys general was filed on July 28.
More than 505,000 Nevadans, about 15% of the population, received SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, in 2024. The Trump administration says it intends to use the data to crack down on and investigate alleged fraud. 
But the effort raises concerns that agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement could use the information against individuals it seeks to deport.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo did not respond to questions about the state’s decision to turn over the data, or whether he was aware Ford, who is challenging Lombardo for governor, intended to fight the effort. Ford’s office also did not respond.
The Division of Social Services official who oversees SNAP was out of the office Friday.
In March, Trump issued an executive order titled “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,” and ordered each state to provide SNAP applicant and recipient data, “including but not limited to personally identifiable information in the form of names, dates of birth, personal addresses used, and Social Security numbers.”
SNAP is a state-administered, federally-funded program that provides billions of dollars in food assistance to tens of millions of low-income families. Personal information is provided to state and federal administrators in order to receive assistance, with an understanding that the information will only be used for SNAP purposes.
The data request places states in the position of breaching their agreement with recipients and applicants by providing the personal data or risking the loss of federal funding for the critical assistance.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1287472642-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 17:58:55.602074

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The U.S. secretary of Transportation is raising concerns about the state’s use of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs to select contractors for the Francis Scott Key Bridge replacement, saying such programs are potentially unconstitutional.
In a letter to state officials Thursday, Secretary Sean Duffy wrote that he has a “specific concern” over whether the state “intends to award contracts for the FSK Bridge project in a manner that relies on the race or sex of contractors.”
“Any reliance on race- or sex-conscious factors in contracting decisions could introduce significant legal vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in the management of the project,” Duffy wrote, adding that the administration believes “race- and sex-based ‘presumptions’ of disadvantage” in its own Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program are “unconstitutional.”
“As outlined in my ‘Follow the Law‘ letter of April 25, 2025, addressed to all recipients of DOT funding, the Equal Protection principles of the U.S. Constitution prohibit State and Federal governmental entities from discriminating on the basis of protected characteristics, including race and sex,” Duffy wrote. “Discrimination based on race is, has been, and will continue to be unlawful, except in rare circumstances.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D), in a statement, did not directly address Duffy’s remarks about race- and sex-conscious factors but instead answered his concerns about the “overall cost and schedule for completion” of the bridge. Initial projections from the state said it expects the Key Bridge to reopen in 2028 at a cost of $1.8 billion.
Loss of Key Bridge leads to more potholes, truck traffic in neighborhoods

“We will continue to work with the Trump Administration to find ways to reduce costs and rebuild faster,” Moore said in his statement. “We anticipate the price estimation process to be finalized in the coming months and we will provide regular updates from the Maryland Department of Transportation about the project’s status.
“In the meantime, we will continue to pursue litigation and make substantial financial contributions by way of advance construction costs and insurance settlement dollars to keep the project moving,” he said.
Moore concluded by saying safety and “the sound stewardship of taxpayer dollars remain our top priority as we work to fully restore economic vitality—not only to the Port of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, but for the people across the country.”
Nine of Maryland’s 10 federal legislators noted that the federal commitment to covering the costs of the bridge replacement is set in law.
“The Key Bridge was bigger than Baltimore and Maryland – its collapse took away a vital transportation artery for the broader region and a gateway to the Port of Baltimore,” the lawmakers, all Democrats, wrote in a brief statement. “As we have with other major infrastructure disasters with nationwide implications, Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to provide the full resources necessary for reconstruction to ensure it can be rebuilt as quickly and efficiently as possible.
The lawmakers said they would work with federal transportation officials to “keep delivering on this national priority and commitment.”
Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the state’s sole Republican member of Congress and chair of the House Freedom Caucus, did not sign the letter.
In April, Duffy warned states that they could lose federal transportation funding for failing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts or if they continued to use DEI policies.
“It shouldn’t be controversial – enforce our immigration rules, end anti-American DEI policies, and protect free speech,” Duffy wrote in that April letter. “These values reflect the priorities of the American people, and I will take action to ensure compliance.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In June, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction against the federal policy. Maryland was part of a coalition of nearly two dozen states that sued to block the effort.
Maryland officials continue to press forward with a plan to remove the remains of the bridge that collapsed after a massive cargo ship struck a bridge support. The March 26, 2024, incident killed six people working on the bridge, stymied cargo vessels moving in and out of the Port of Baltimore and cut off a vital transportation artery carrying Interstate 695 over the Patapsco River.
Congress, under then President Joe Biden, approved a plan to cover 100% of the costs. Initial state estimates have placed those costs at around $1.8 billion.
“As you know, it is a high priority of the Trump Administration to build big beautiful new roads and bridges that enable people and products to move faster and more efficiently, thereby supporting economic growth and prosperity for America,” Duffy wrote in his Thursday letter to Maryland officials. “We want the replacement of the FSK Bridge to be a model of how to build quickly and cost effectively.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9617-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

John Sauer argued that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has the authority to revoke extended protections initially granted to Venezuelans under the Biden administration. Those protections extended Temporary Protected Status to one group of Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2023 and another who came in 2021. “The new order again displaces the Secretary's judgment on a matter committed to her unreviewable discretion by law, again impedes important immigration enforcement policies, and again ties up the Secretary's actions in protracted litigation that will effectively nullify them absent relief from this Court,” Sauer wrote. Former President Joe Biden granted TPS holders from Venezuela protections until October 2026. TPS is granted when a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, political instability or extreme natural disasters. The Trump administration has moved to end TPS status for several groups, including Venezuelans. The status protects immigrants from deportation and grants work permits.This is the second time in this legal battle the Trump administration is appealing to the high court to let it end protections for Venezuelans. In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to temporarily terminate TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans but the case continued in lower courts.",,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-19 20:53:07+00:00,CT Mirror,Political challenges of CT HB 5002 depicted in Ned Lamont’s texts,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/ct-hb-5002-ned-lamont-texts/,"The texts show how affordable housing has become a political quagmire for Democrats, with some urging him to sign it despite voting no.","In the days leading up to Gov. Ned Lamont’s veto of a major housing bill, his phone pinged with messages from lawmakers who wanted him to sign the measure — including some who voted against House Bill 5002.
The text messages, obtained by The Connecticut Mirror through an open records request, show how affordable housing has become a political quagmire for the state’s Democrats. Lawmakers who voted for and against the bill told the CT Mirror there were some who voted no for political reasons, even though they agreed with what it did. 
Some took a risk and voted yes, although it may not play well in their districts. And Lamont, weighing a third term, vetoed it after prolonged concerns about the messaging from opponents and advice on how signing the bill would resonate in wealthy Fairfield County towns. 
Lamont seemed to know his decision to veto was making few in his party happy.
“Lots of Democratic legislative [sic] is very angry, may take a walk around the park in a few hours,” Lamont texted an ally on June 23, just a couple of hours after he vetoed House Bill 5002.
The bill was the most significant piece of housing legislation to cross the governor’s desk since he took office in 2019. It aimed to improve the affordability and accessibility of housing and tackled issues like zoning, transit-oriented development, parking, homelessness and fair rent commissions.
The text messages also confirm previous reporting by the CT Mirror showing that Lamont sought counsel in the days leading up to his veto. The messages include questions from Lamont to Fairfield County advisors about how the housing bill would play politically.
“I wanted to text you to encourage you to run for a third term!,” Steven Sheinberg, chair of the Fairfield Democratic Town Committee, texted the governor.
“On 5002. My download for you is that it is a net negative politically to you. For Democrats, too, especially in our county. It is our biggest weakness here,” Sheinberg continued. 
In a statement to CT Mirror, Sheinberg said the governor should convene a blue ribbon panel to come up with recommendations on what to do about the housing crisis.
Lamont also asked Mark Boughton, the commissioner of the Department of Revenue Services and former longtime mayor of Danbury, what he thought about the housing bill for Danbury and the rest of Fairfield County.
“I don’t want to lose those towns …,” Boughton responded, mentioning towns like Ridgefield. “Our brand of being a moderate compassionate leader is a winning formula.” He then suggested a veto followed by a special session.
Reached by phone, Boughton declined to comment further.
“Although the Governor consulted current and former local elected leaders from both sides of the aisle on the housing bill, electoral politics did not play a role in the Governor’s decision on the original housing bill,” Lamont’s spokesman Rob Blanchard said in a statement. 
‘Difficult seats’
The bill passed with narrow margins — 84-67 in the House, and 20-15 in the Senate in May. To overturn a veto, each chamber has to approve a measure with a two-thirds vote, which would mean 101 votes in the House and 24 in the Senate.
Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, was among those who voted against the bill but later texted Lamont asking him to sign.
“Hey Governor, would you be willing to connect about the Housing bill?,” Leeper wrote on June 7. “As someone who voted no, I actually hope that you won’t veto it.”
Leeper said in a written statement that she wanted him to sign it, then have the legislature come back in special session to make changes. She also had concerns about the parking and assigned number of housing units.
Lamont and other state officials have expressed concerns about misinformation around the bill, and Lamont privately mentioned frustration about the group CT169Strong’s characterization of the bill. One of the group’s founders said previously that they “stand by everything we’ve said about what’s in the bill.”
“I shared with the Governor the same thing that I shared with my constituents, that a lot of what this bill aimed to achieve was mischaracterized and grounded in misinformation,” Leeper wrote in a statement to CT Mirror. “I believed there was a better way to fix this bill, rather than the long drawn out veto process.”
On June 6, Rep. Anne Hughes, D-Easton, texted the governor about the economic boon to Fairfield County that the housing bill could unlock. Hughes, who voted in favor of the bill, was attending an event on the economy with several other representatives and a member of the governor’s staff.
“We are so proud to stand up with you in signing this culmination of years of work in closing the economic and racial disparity in our state,” Hughes wrote. “We are all with you!”
She went on to list some of the people she was referencing, including Rep. Sarah Keitt, D-Fairfield, and Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport. Both of those legislators had voted against the bill.
Hughes said in an interview that the lawmakers talked at the event and agreed Lamont should sign the measure.
“We fully expected him to sign it because we had negotiated with his office a robust bill,”  Hughes said. “There were some members of our caucus that were for it, but in potentially difficult seats, so they didn’t vote for it.”
Keitt said in an interview that federal legislation has since changed the landscape of what a family can afford in Connecticut, and that the bill is needed now more than it was before.
“I have my personal opinions,” she said of her no vote. “I also have to weigh what my constituents want, and my constituents, at the time, didn’t support the bill.”
She said she believes “the numbers are different now,” and that people in her district may not be able to afford their housing in a few months.
“That calculation has changed for me, as well as the fact that we’ve made compromises to the housing bill,” she said.
In an interview, Steinberg said he was not in favor of the bill and that Hughes “doesn’t speak for me.” He supports affordable housing and wants to see legislation he can vote for, he added.
“I’ve always been a moderate and as you’re probably aware, despite my stated desire to pass better affordable housing legislation, I’ve actually been one of the leaders defeating some of the bad stuff in recent years,” Steinberg said.
Blanchard, Lamont’s spokesperson, said in a statement that lawmakers have to balance the needs of their constituents with finding solutions to big problems.
“Many lawmakers may have opposed the bill based on concerns from their constituents but philosophically supported the approach and goals of the legislation,” Blanchard said. “Everyone can agree that we need to build more housing to meet demand, to lower housing costs and to provide shelter to the homeless, while also looking at different ways to achieve these goals.”
Lamont said when he announced the veto that he wanted to see legislation that got more local leadership on board. He had particular concerns with measures that would eliminate minimum off-street parking requirements for smaller apartment complexes and another that would require towns to plan and zone for a set number of units of housing.
The governor’s office has been in negotiations with legislative leadership for the past several weeks working on a new version of the bill. Officials hope to have a special session sometime next month.
“The Governor continues to meet and collaborate with legislative leaders, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as COST and CCM on finalizing a new draft of the housing bill,” said Blanchard, in a statement. “Addressing our housing needs in a way that builds on our state’s investment in housing, while also encouraging towns to join our efforts, has always been a priority for Governor Lamont.”
Democratic leaders in the House and Senate said they were aware some of their colleagues liked the legislation and voted against it.
“I think there are a variety of reasons why people vote no if they know that their vote isn’t necessary for it to pass,” said Planning and Development Committee co-chair Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon.
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said housing can be a tough political issue.
“Certainly there are political considerations when people are taking votes on bills, particularly around housing and zoning issues,” Rojas said. “But that doesn’t always necessarily mean that they don’t support the policy or want to see action be taken on it.”
‘A big chance’
On the flip side, lawmakers said, there were some who are in difficult districts for zoning reform, which typically include small towns or suburbs, who took a risk and voted for the bill.
“I hope that the gov doesn’t veto it since things do need to change, and a lot of us took a big chance and voted for it,” said Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, said in a text message to Lamont’s chief of staff ahead of the veto.
Welander said her district is complicated because there are four towns that all have very different needs. Part of her district includes Woodbridge, which has been subject to a lawsuit over its zoning practices for affordable housing.
“I had really hoped that this bill, 5002 would go through, because we had been assured that it would be signed by the governor, that a lot of us had been spent a lot of time and effort, either working on it, or, in my case, just going through it line by line, and learning as much as I could to ensure that I could vote on it in a way that wasn’t going to harm my towns,” Welander said in an interview.
Blanchard said in a statement that Welander is a “champion for her district,” and that the governor has worked with Democrats to achieve many things including tax cuts, investments in education and housing and reform to the child care system that aims to provide free care for some families. He also said Lamont did not take into consideration lawmakers’ reelection odds when making his decision. 
Many of those who took the risk, like Welander, are now left feeling politically vulnerable because of the veto, lawmakers said.
“They were anxious about voting for it,” said Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London. “It was the morally correct thing to do, and then to have the governor veto it after they did the right thing, they were upset.”
Rep. Robin Comey, D-Branford, messaged the governor’s chief of staff Matthew Brokman on June 10.
“I’ll be very disappointed if the governor vetoes the housing bill,” Comey wrote. “I’m standing strong behind my vote and to have him veto would be devastating.”
Hughes said she gets backlash from her district over housing, but stands behind her vote.
“I always say to especially my freshman colleagues and people in difficult districts, ‘Defend your votes, explain it and educate your constituency,’” she said.
She and other lawmakers said the veto will make it difficult to trust Lamont’s office in future negotiations.
“It was the team, playing, working really well with each other, and he chose not to be part of the team,” Marx said.
“How can we go forward when now it has signaled to the opposition that all you’ve got to do is get people to call the governor’s office, certainly key people that he listens to, and he’ll veto it?” Hughes said. “It’s very, very difficult to move forward in good faith.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-014-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

Kevin Stitt's State of the State Address on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A panel has recommended all Oklahoma judges get a 17.58% salary hike.
If approved by lawmakers, the proposed hike recommended Tuesday by the Board of Judicial Compensation would mean the Oklahoma Supreme Court chief justice would earn $233,062 a year while district judges would make $197,189. 
Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman, who serves as president of the Oklahoma Judges Association, said the cost will be about $10 million. 
The state has 277 trial and appellate judges, Balkman said.
In a letter to state leaders, Ty Tyler, Board on Judicial Compensation chair, said the increase would make Oklahoma judicial salaries equivalent to the regional average.
Oklahoma ranks 45th in judicial pay, the letter said.
“It was the agreement of the board that the role of our judiciary is becoming even more important and to draw qualified candidates we needed to be competitive with the region,” said Lauren Brookey, a board member. 
The board meets to make recommendations for judicial compensation  every two years. Any change requires legislative approval.
The Board of Judicial Compensation in 2023 recommended a 17% hike in judicial salaries, Balkman said. 
In 2024, the Legislature approved a 7% hike for district judges. The following year, lawmakers approved a 7% hike for appellate court judges, Balkman said.
Oklahoma’s 27 district attorneys salaries are tied to the salaries of district judges, Balkman said. The $10 million does not include an increase for prosecutors, he said.
Statewide elected officials’ salaries were also once tied to judicial salaries, but they were decoupled about a decade ago.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson signed onto a letter released Friday that urges college leaders to defend free speech and “say no to the ‘Assassin’s Veto.’”
The letter led by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird cautions college officials against stifling free speech and debate in the name of protecting it through unfair or disproportionate security measures and costs.
“Particularly at this moment, it is critical our state institutions of higher learning serve as forums for robust debate from all perspectives,” Bird wrote in the letter addressed to “presidents and deans of universities and colleges.” “The campus should be the very place where the First Amendment rings loudest for all to hear.”
It follows the Iowa Board of Regents directing public universities to quickly investigate and censure, up to job termination, employees alleged to have posted comments celebrating the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In South Carolina, an opinion by Wilson cleared the way for college officials to fire employees for their posts.
Kirk was shot and killed Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University as he debated with students at an outside event.
“The tragedy of Charlie Kirk’s assassination is a sobering reminder that the right to free speech must be protected,” Bird said in a press release on the letter. “Charlie was murdered while debating on a university campus, a place where the free exchange of ideas should be encouraged; we cannot allow the actions of an assassin to stop free speech in any way. Colleges and universities must take steps to keep their students safe while preserving free discussion and open debate.”
Citing 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, the letter stated that requiring “exorbitant” security fees for certain groups or events based on the content or viewpoint expressed by the speech can go against the First Amendment.
The letter cited the University of New Mexico’s attempt in 2023 to impose security fees totaling more than $5,000 on Turning Point USA — co-founded by Kirk — for an event that October hosted by the organization featuring former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines, an outspoken opponent of transgender women competing in women’s sports. A judge issued a preliminary injunction against the college for the fees, the letter stated.
University security policies must be transparent and nondiscriminatory, the letter stated, and security fees must be decided upon in a “content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral manner.” Facility use policies should follow these rules as well, and ensuring the safety of eventgoers and participants should be handled by the institution rather than act as a barrier for certain types of speech, it added.
If universities advertise themselves as being open for public speech and debate, placing more scrutiny and fees on conservative speakers and events — or refusing to host them altogether — while not doing the same for politically neutral or liberal speakers could also violate state Consumer Fraud Acts or Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices laws, the letter stated.
“Universities shouldn’t shut down free speech on campus because of potential danger but should be encouraging civil discourse and condemning political violence at all levels. I believe that’s what Charlie would have wanted, and it’s what I want as well,” Wilson wrote in a release about the letter.
Clemson fires 2 professors, Coastal Carolina fires 1 employee over social media posts

He signed on days after publicly releasing a letter to Clemson University President James Clements making clear that colleges in South Carolina could fire employees over their social media posts about Kirk’s death without risking prosecution. A South Carolina law dating to 1950 makes it illegal to “discharge a citizen from employment or occupation” because of their “political opinions or the exercise of political rights and privileges guaranteed to every citizen.”
While Wilson guaranteed in his letter Monday that the state wouldn’t pursue charges for terminating employees for social media posts he called “vile and incendiary,” he noted fired workers could still sue if they believe their free speech rights were violated.
At least four employees of South Carolina public colleges have been fired since Monday for posts about Kirk, including three at Clemson and one at Coastal Carolina.
In Bird’s letter, the attorneys general pledged to “fully and fairly investigate” colleges in their state for any complaint about unfair security fees or protocols.
Beyond Wilson, the 15 other attorneys general signing onto Bird’s letter are from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah.
“We trust that you will continue to take steps to keep your campuses safe,” the letter stated. “And we also trust that you won’t use safety as a pretext to silence debate, at a time when it is sorely needed.”

“Strengthening connections with local partners is a priority for Luther College, and we are excited by how this new partnership with the Decorah Community School District will deepen the relationship between our two organizations,” said Luther College President Brad Chamberlain in the release. “The partnership reflects a mutual commitment to invest in our local community by improving opportunities for students from Decorah to access and afford a Luther education.”
In order to qualify for preferred admission, the release stated Decorah High School students must remain in good standing with the district, have a minimum 3.25 grade-point average and complete Algebra II by the end of their junior year of high school.
In addition to institutional scholarships they may receive, students going down the preferred admission path will be eligible for the institution’s $500 Preferred Admission award.
Decorah high school students are “among the best in the nation,” Matthew Beatty, Luther College vice president for enrollment management, said in the release, and graduates who have chosen Luther to continue their education have thrived there.
Decorah Community School District Superintendent Tim Cronin said in the release the partnership is a new way of supporting students and their future goals.
“Many Decorah High School students already excel in academics, the arts and athletics, and this agreement provides them with the opportunity to continue their education at Luther while remaining connected to the community that has fostered their growth,” Cronin said in the release.

But Democrats, including Connecticut’s senators and representatives, aren’t backing off their insistence that any short-term funding bill must address health care priorities such as extending subsidies that would prevent sharp increases in insurance premiums.
The path forward is unclear, and the time crunch makes it more complicated. Congress is out of town all next week, and the House won’t return for votes until after the Sept. 30 deadline. The House originally had votes scheduled two days before the deadline, but GOP leadership cancelled them on Friday.If neither side budges, that raises the prospect of a shutdown.
Lawmakers in both chambers took the first steps on Friday to pass a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, to keep government agencies running at current levels for a specific amount of time. A short-term deal buys them more time to negotiate a full-year spending package for fiscal year 2026.
The House first passed a bill to keep the government running through Nov. 21. It passed mostly along party lines, but because Republicans narrowly control the House and only needed a simple majority, they didn’t need to rely on Democratic votes. Only two Republicans opposed it, and one Democrat backed the GOP proposal. All five Democratic members of Connecticut’s House delegation voted against it.
But the bill failed once it made it to the Senate, along with a competing measure from Democrats. The Democratic version extended funding through Oct. 31 and included similar provisions, such as more funds for lawmaker security. But Democrats added a host of health care measures that have been nonstarters for Republicans.
In the Senate, Republicans need votes from at least seven Democratic senators to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance a bill. All but one Democrat opposed the GOP continuing resolution, and both of Connecticut’s senators voted no.
Even with the short window, lawmakers have more time to strike a deal. But in the event they can’t figure it out in the next two weeks, Congress could be heading toward a shutdown —the first since a partial shutdown that started late December 2018 and lasted about a month into January 2019, during President Donald Trump’s first term.
In the event of a shutdown, essential functions and services would continue, including the intelligence community and other national security agencies. The most immediate consequences would be furloughs of federal employees who work for various government agencies. Some workers, however, would be exempt, such as the military and most air traffic controllers. But they wouldn’t get paid during a shutdown and would receive back pay once government operations resumed.
The longer a shutdown lasts, the more it could interrupt other key services. Connecticut’s senators warned of risks to veterans’ affairs facilities, as well as Head Start child care centers, that might not be deemed essential, as they were in the past.
But given an already-diminished federal workforce, a shutdown this year brings new risks, including the slowdown of important grants to some programs and services.
“It’s not just the checks going out — someone has to approve the checks, release the grant money,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in an interview. “We’re in uncharted territory with so many of these agencies already hollowed out, so a shutdown could be a tipping point.”
Both parties are already pointing fingers. Republicans say they offered Democrats a “clean” extension of government funding for the next seven weeks. They called Democrats’ plan an “unserious” proposal with a hefty price tag.
“The kind of clean CR Republicans have put forward used to be something Democrats embraced. In fact, Democrats voted in favor of clean CRs no fewer than 13 times during the Biden administration,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said. He called Democrats’ alternative a “fundamentally unserious proposal designed to appease Democrats’ liberal base.”
Democrats counter that the GOP won’t engage with them in bipartisan negotiations to keep the government running.
They are trying to exert the rare leverage they have in funding talks, with their main priority focused on extending Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, undoing health care provisions in the “big beautiful bill” including Medicaid cuts, and reining in the Trump administration from clawing back funding that Congress already approved.
Their version of a continuing resolution was crafted in part by U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, who serves as the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., argued that having some guardrails in place for how the White House freezes or pulls back approved federal funding is especially important for Connecticut. He pointed to the administration’s decision to halt the state’s offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, which is 80% completed.
“We just want the president to obey the law. We don’t want insurance rates for people to go up, and unfortunately, Republicans are unwilling to stand up for families all across this country here and see insurance premiums go up and to stand up for the Constitution and rule of law,” Murphy told reporters on a call with Blumenthal after the Senate voted on the dueling government funding bills.
Republicans have resisted including the expiring subsidies in the bill and believe they can be addressed later in separate legislation. Democrats argue there’s an urgency to get it done now, particularly with open enrollment in the state-based exchanges beginning on Nov. 1.
“For everybody who is thinking, ‘Well, can’t they wait?’ No, we cannot wait to do these measures,” Blumenthal said on the call with reporters. “It is imperative that we act now. There is an urgency to people who are going to be sick, who need surgeries, who are undergoing treatment, and their health care insurance will be unaffordable to them because the premium tax credits will end or they will be off Medicaid.”
If the subsidies expire at the end of the year, states would have to pick up the costs. For Connecticut, officials could spend more than $295 million a year, according to a spokesperson with Access Health CT.
That prompted Gov. Ned Lamont and governors from 17 other states to call on congressional leaders to extend federal subsidies that help more people afford health coverage through state-based marketplaces. 
Nationally, if the subsidies expire at the end of the year, the Congressional Budget Office projects that more than 4 million people would lose health care coverage over the next decade, citing increases in out-of-pocket expenses because of more costly premiums. Connecticut residents who get insurance through the state health care exchange could pay an average of $1,700 more a year.
The expiration of enhanced tax credits will lead to out-of-pocket premiums for ACA marketplace enrollees increasing by an average of more than 75%. Insurers expect healthier enrollees would drop their coverage and cause premiums to then go up, according to a Peterson-KFF analysis.
If the government shuts down on Oct. 1, it’s unclear how long it would last and what negotiations between the parties would look like.
“I don’t know. It’s obviously very worrying that [Republicans] are not negotiating now,” Murphy said. “And I worry that Donald Trump has just decided that he’s not going to talk to Democrats. He’s going to use the White House to try to politically punish Democrats.”
Blumenthal echoed the sentiment that any talks could be at the whims of the president. “He could decide the day after the shutdown that he wants to negotiate and do what’s right for the country.”

Secretary of State Cole Jester’s office put out a request for qualifications (RFQ) for wearable or carryable “mobile emergency alert system” in July, after the assassination of a Minnesota state representative and her husband, which also saw a state senator gravely wounded.

The document said further that the system had to be “highly portable” as well as reliable, and would need the capability to notify Arkansas Capitol Police to an emergency from anywhere on the Capitol grounds, as well as the location where the system was triggered.
Samantha Boyd, Jester’s spokesperson, told the Advocate the motivation was “political violence just in general.” The system would be used by both Capitol staff and lawmakers.
“Schools are doing this too, so we thought it was time for us to kind of join in on that,” Boyd added.
Boyd said Jester’s office is negotiating with Centegix, which creates similar systems for governments and schools. Ron Self, the former director of safety, security and risk management for the Little Rock School District and head of security for the Little Rock-based Baldwin and Shell Construction Company, is on Centegix’s Customer Advisory Board.
The Atlanta-based firm was the only one to respond to June’s RFQ, Boyd said.
Boyd said while a timeline was being worked out as part of the negotiations, the goal was to have a system delivered as soon as possible.

Kirk was fatally shot Sept. 10 while speaking at a college campus in Utah. The House resolution came as President Donald Trump and his administration have sought to crack down on anti-Kirk rhetoric.


Here is how members of the Colorado delegation to the U.S. House voted on the resolution “Honoring the life and legacy of Charles ‘Charlie’ James Kirk“:

Lauren Boebert (R): Yes
Jeff Crank (R): Yes
Jason Crow (D): Yes
Diana DeGette (D): Present
Gave Evans (R): Yes
Jeff Hurd (R): Yes
Joe Neguse (D): Not voting
Brittany Pettersen (D): Present



Pettersen supports language in the resolution that condemns violence, but she “could not vote in favor of the partisan language” also included in the resolution, she said. She and other Democrats introduced a separate resolution “condemning all forms of political violence and rejecting rhetoric that dehumanizes or demonizes political opponents.” It highlighted the June assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, among other acts of political violence in recent years, including the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
“Instead of bringing us together to heal and stand together, unfortunately, Speaker Johnson was willing to play partisan games that continue to divide us,” Pettersen said in a statement, referring to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson. “It is truly unimaginable that in this moment of tragedy, these cynical tactics were prioritized over the leadership that is so desperately needed right now in our country.”










“I went to war three times for this country to defend the Constitution and the rights of people to say things I may disagree with ... The right of every American to speak freely, peacefully organize, and protest is fundamental to who we are. After all, what is more American than the ability to question authority?


– U.S. Rep. Jason Crow


Crow voted in favor of the resolution a day after he gave a floor speech in the House condemning political violence and highlighting the importance of free speech. He said Trump, who blamed “the radical left” for Kirk’s death, is attacking the rights of those who disagree with him. 
“I went to war three times for this country to defend the Constitution and the rights of people to say things I may disagree with,” Crow, a former Army Ranger, said in his speech. “The right of every American to speak freely, peacefully organize, and protest is fundamental to who we are. After all, what is more American than the ability to question authority? Questioning authority is, in fact, our foundation and how we came about as a nation.”
DeGette said Congress “cannot condemn political violence only when it happens to one party,” adding that she supports the Democrat-led resolution condemning political violence because it “denounces all forms of political violence, regardless of the victim’s political affiliation.”
“However, I cannot vote yes on this resolution because it grossly misrepresents Charlie Kirk’s methods, views, and beliefs while citing Christian nationalist language,” DeGette said in a statement. “I will always condemn heinous acts of violence, but this resolution ignores the false and hateful rhetoric that was too often present in his debates.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham and state lawmakers don’t agree to put medical health care worker compacts onto the agenda of the Oct. 1 special legislative session.
Under such compacts, participating states accept medical workers professionally licensed in other states, thus expanding the work force.
On Monday, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services opened applications for states to apply for the $50 billion federal Rural Health Transformation Program, authorized by the so-called “big beautiful bill.”  According to guidelines released earlier this week for the fund by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, applicants who participate in interstate compacts for nurses, doctors, psychologists, emergency medical personnel and physician assistants will be given preference for rural hospital funding.
Hospital advocates, state officials navigating federal funding ‘uncertainty’

New Mexico is a member of just one interstate compact agreement — for nurses — and is one of only four states that participate in one or fewer compacts. Earlier this year, lawmakers passed seven compact agreements out of the state House with broad bipartisan support, and said they hoped doing so would address the worker shortage impacting patients and care across the state. All of the bills, however, stalled in the state Senate.
The federal agency will close initial applications for the Rural Health Transformation Fund on Nov. 5, leaving little time for lawmakers to approve New Mexico’s participation, according to Think New Mexico Executive Director Fred Nathan, whose organization previously lobbied for the medical compact legislation, and identified them as a key element of addressing the state’s health care worker shortages.
Choosing to bump the issue to the January session would put New Mexico at a disadvantage and possibly forfeit federal funds, he told Source NM.
“Legislative leaders have an opportunity to maximize federal support for New Mexico’s rural hospitals by working with the governor to include the health care worker compacts on the agenda for the Oct. 1 special session ” Nathan said.
Republican lawmakers have said they wanted to include health worker compacts as part of the agenda for the special session in a letter to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham earlier this week.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, shared a stage Friday to reflect on their friendship and bipartisan approach to governance, one they said they hope will serve as an example to a nation reeling from the assassination of rightwing commentator Charlie Kirk.
The pair spoke on stage at Notre Dame University for a talk titled “Pragmatism over Polarization,” which the university’s president, Rev. Robert Dowd, moderated. He asked both governors to offer their perspectives on political violence, polarization and bucking their own parties for the common good. 
As leader of the state that became the global epicenter of political violence last week, Cox has given news conferences viewed around the world since Kirk’s death. He’s used the news conferences to both update the public about the arrest of and allegations against suspect Tyler Robinson, but also to call for calm and disagreement without violence.
He reiterated that message Friday, saying “disagreeing better” is increasingly vital in a polarized nation under threat of political violence. 
“We can’t solve any of the greatest problems affecting our country if we all hate each other,” he said. 
Bomb threats target homes of state Democratic Senate and House leaders Wirth and Szczepanski

Lujan Grisham lamented the state of politics, which she said has coarsened to the point where violence or threats of violence are commonplace. Late last week, bomb threats against New Mexico Democratic legislative leaders  prompted the brief closure of a school and Santa Fe City Hall. 
“I don’t think there’s any elected official in America that hasn’t had a threat of violence or an absolute death threat made against them,” she said.
Cox and Lujan Grisham pointed to their friendship and working relationship as members of the Western Governor’s Association, which convened earlier this year in Santa Fe. Cox took over the helm of the organization from Lujan Grisham in Santa Fe. 
He pointed to the governors’ shared work on housing affordability last year as proof that respectful disagreement in politics is possible and worthwhile.
“We’re in this room, all these governors talking about it,” he said. “ And I truly wish every American could watch that, because you would be unable to tell who were the Republicans and who were the Democrats in that room, because this is a problem they were trying to solve together.”
Both said turning down the temperature despite the high stakes of politics requires deeper listening and debate that begins with mutual respect. Lujan Grisham said she would try to be better about that during his last year in office.
“Talk to someone who has different views than you do,” she said. “Listen to them. Be open minded, try to understand. I have not done enough of that in my political career, and so I’m dedicated to making time and room for more of that.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-19-at-11.15.33-AM-1024x574.png,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

The Iowa Board of Nursing recently charged nurse Christopher Bourbon, 40, of West Des Moines, with unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public, habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs or alcohol, and violating a contract with the Iowa Professional Health Program.
According to the board, Bourbon entered the program, which helps nurses with substance-abuse and alcohol issues, in October 2023. In November 2024, the program allegedly  reported “significant noncompliance” with the program by Bourbon.
The board alleges Bourbon failed to provide breathalyzer tests on multiple occasions in September and October 2024, failed to provide signed releases for his worksite monitor, and failed to arrange for a required evaluation.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the board, Bourbon was “informed by phone and in writing to stop practicing nursing” in October 2024, although GPS tracking showed that he was at his place of employment in early November 2024.
The board alleges that while working at an unspecified health clinic from August 2023 until July 2024, Bourbon was suspected of practicing nursing while impaired. According to the board, Bourbon was the only medical provider working at the clinic on the morning of July 15, 2024, when he appeared disheveled, unable to focus, and was alternately crying and “giggly.”
According to the board, “video surveillance footage showed (Bourbon) wobbling around” in the clinic and two patients he cared for that day later raised concerns about whether they had received the correct medication given Bourbon’s condition.
Another patient identified Bourbon’s behavior as abnormal and had Bourbon lock the doors and close the clinic, the board alleges. When the clinic owner arrived later that day, an open bottle of champagne was allegedly found in the clinic refrigerator.
To resolve the case, Bourbon recently agreed to a 12-month suspension of his nursing license and agreed to submit to a substance abuse evaluation. If his license is reinstated after 12 months, it will be placed on probationary status for two years and he will required to submit to chemical screening.
On Aug. 29, 2025, Bourbon was arrested and charged with second-offense drunken driving. He has yet to enter a plea in the case.
Home health nurse charged
In a separate matter, the Board of Nursing recently charged Tera Serbousek, 46, of Cedar Rapids, with practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or illicit drugs, or while impaired by the use of legitimately prescribed medications.
According to the board, Serbousek was employed by a home care agency called To The Rescue from October 2024 to December 2024. In November 2024, she allegedly showed up at a patient’s residence while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
According to the board, Serbousek was job-shadowing another nurse at the time. Serbousek allegedly passed out or fell asleep and an ambulance was summoned when the other nurse was unable to wake her.
Serbousek was allegedly admitted to the hospital and released the next day. She allegedly admitted to the agency staff that she had been drinking heavily the night before her shift. Board records indicate Serbousek was allowed to maintain her employment with the agency and in December 2024, a staff member at To The Rescue contacted her superiors to report concerns that Serbousek was again inebriated at work.
At the time, Serbousek was alleged to be speaking slowly, unable to remember her laptop password, and unable to recall how to complete medical charts. A subsequent test revealed the presence of alcohol in her system, the board alleges.
To settle the case, Serbousek recently agreed to a one-year suspension of her nursing license.
On Aug. 28, 2025, Serbousek was convicted of first-offense drunken driving, a charge that stemmed from a March 24, 2025, arrest in Linn County.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderATLANTA — The top vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Friday to change long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults, though a proposal to require prescriptions for all individuals seeking the shot narrowly failed.  
If approved by CDC leaders, the recommendations will also place a new emphasis on the risks of COVID-19 immunizations, despite the agency’s own data demonstrating that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people.
CDC vaccine panel votes to limit use of a childhood vaccine as COVID, hepatitis B decisions loom

The panel, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a wide range of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. Several states —including Georgia, where the CDC is headquartered — have codified the committee’s recommendations into law, allowing the panel to play a key role in determining which vaccines are covered by insurance companies and how accessible immunizations are for the general public.
Though the panel did not withdraw an existing CDC recommendation that individuals between the ages of six months and 64 years get vaccinated, it does require “an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination is most favorable for individuals who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease and lowest for individuals who are not at increased risk.” For adults ages 65 and older, vaccine recommendations will be “based on individual decision-making.”
COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Americans is currently much lower than that of other immunizations, such as the flu shot. Only 13% of U.S. children were up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines as of April, according to Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, who serves as the acting chief medical officer for CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Among adults ages 65 and older, that number hovers around 43%.
The CDC’s own data showed that COVID-19 vaccines reduced serious disease and emergency department visits among both children and adults. But during Friday’s meeting, some ACIP officials questioned — without evidence — whether COVID-19 vaccines provide any advantage to the people who chose to get them.
“What is the true efficacy and true benefits that these vaccines provide?” said Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Dr. Robert Malone, a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is also a biochemist who has previously said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise.” Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder.
Robert Malone, an ACIP member and biochemist who has previously said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise,” also pushed back on data showing that COVD-19 vaccines provide protection for the general public.
“There is no established correlative protection for COVID, period, full stop, and stop saying otherwise,” he said in a tense exchange with a fellow committee member.
Other public health officials criticized the proposed rule change that would have required patients to obtain a prescription before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
“If we start asking for prescriptions for vaccines, which are again, a primary prevention public health strategy, we are going to overwhelm physicians’ offices,” said Dr. Amy Middleman, who serves as a liaison member on behalf of the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. “It’s alarming to me that for a primary preventive strategy, we are actually adding access concerns and barriers, rather than diminishing them.”
The committee also signaled that it would be open to revising current CDC recommendations that advise all pregnant Americans to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Current guidelines state that mRNA vaccines are safe and effective for those who are pregnant, and can help provide immunity to babies under six months of age, who are too young to get vaccinated.
But Levi, who delivered a presentation that centered on the risks of COVID-19 vaccines, argued that current guidelines do not fully underscore the risk of adverse effects from vaccines.
“We decided not to bring it to a vote today, but we do hope that the FDA and the CDC will look much more carefully into this,” he said. “Most of us are extremely concerned about the safety and the lack of robust evidence for not only pregnant women, but their babies.”

Kennedy Jr.’s new vaccine advisers added confusion Friday to this fall’s COVID-19 vaccinations — declining to recommend them for anyone and leaving the choice up to those who want a shot.
Until now, the vaccinations had been routinely provided to nearly all Americans who wanted them. The Food and Drug Administration recently put new restrictions on this year’s shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, reserving them for people over 65 or younger ones who are deemed at higher risk from the virus.
In a series of votes, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn’t specifically recommend vaccination but said people could make individual decisions.
The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around the supposed risks of vaccination, an idea that received pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record.
And the divided panel narrowly avoided urging states to require a prescription for the shot.
Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics called the decision not to recommend vaccination “extraordinarily vague” and said it would have “real-time impacts on American children.”
He said the discussion involved clear efforts to “sow distrust” about vaccines.
“It was a very, very strange meeting,” O’Leary said.
The COVID-19 vaccines are not perfect, but CDC data shows they provide the strongest protection against severe infection and death, even if people still become infected. Likewise, people can get COVID-19 repeatedly as the virus continues to evolve.
Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots now are being updated yearly, but only about 44% of seniors and 13% of children were up-to-date on the coronavirus vaccinations last year, the CDC said.
“If you make a recommendation that people are simply not going to follow, I don’t think that’s wise,” said panelist Dr. Cody Meissner of Dartmouth College.
Another question concerns a very rare side effect mostly in young men — a kind of heart inflammation called myocarditis — that was discovered in the early days of vaccination in 2021. A scientist studying whether people with certain genes are uniquely susceptible to that risk told the panel the Trump administration had canceled his grant before the research could be finished.
The panel took up COVID-19 vaccinations as the virus remains a public health threat. CDC data released in June shows the virus resulted in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations last fall and winter. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and young children — especially those who were unvaccinated.
Worried about access, leading medical groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics already have issued recommendations that the vaccines be available to anyone age 6 months and older who wants one — including pregnant women — just like in prior years.
Several states have announced policies to try to assure that access regardless of Friday’s ACIP decision. And a group representing most health insurers, America’s Health Insurance Plans, said earlier this week that its members will continuing covering the shots through 2026.
The panel opened the second day of its meeting with continued confusion over a question it left hanging Thursday: whether to end a longstanding CDC recommendation that all newborns be vaccinated at birth against a liver virus, hepatitis B.

The panel had been considering whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination — something doctors and parents already can choose to do. But amid criticism from independent pediatric and infectious disease specialists who say the vaccine is safe and has helped infant infections drop sharply, the advisers decided Friday to postpone that decision.
On Thursday, the panel recommended a new restriction on another childhood vaccine.
They recommended that for children under 4, their first dose of protection against MMR — measles, mumps and rubella — and chickenpox should be in separate shots, not a combination version known as MMRV. Since 2009, the CDC has said it prefers separate shots for initial doses of those vaccines and 85% of toddlers already do.
On Friday, the committee also recommended that the government’s Vaccines for Children program — which covers vaccine costs for about half of U.S. kids — align its guidance with that narrower MMRV usage.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25261599128177-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority announced Thursday that marshlands in Cameron Parish received $122 million in restoration dollars from Deepwater Horizon settlement funds. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Cameron Parish will receive a sizable grant to help rebuild its vanishing marshlands, state officials announced. 
The Calcasieu-Sabine Basin will get $122 million from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement for drainage improvements geared to help marsh plants grow and halt erosion. 
The basin, on trend with the entire Louisiana coastline, has experienced dramatic wetland loss, with more than 128,000 acres lost since 1932 and a projected 110,000 at risk of loss in a future without intervention, based on data from the United States Geological Survey. 
The first phase of the project, planned along the southeastern edge of Calcasieu Lake, will build seven drainage structures with elements of a levee that allow water to flow back and forth from either side. The design is meant to balance water and salinity levels between the lake and the rest of the watershed, using natural events such as low tides and cold fronts to keep the marsh from being inundated with water. 
“This funding allows us to move from planning to construction on one of our most critical restoration efforts,” Gov. Jeff Landry said Thursday in a Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority news release. 
Future phases of construction include up to 18 miles of channels to improve water flow into the marsh and deposits of dredged material to promote the growth of marsh vegetation. Existing water control structures around Calcasieu Lake will also get maintenance upgrades as needed. 
Estimates of the project’s total cost come to about $260 million, according to the CPRA. A previous $28.6 million grant was put toward planning costs with any remainder to be rolled over for construction and maintenance. 
“The Calcasieu-Sabine project reflects the kind of large-scale, science-based restoration prioritized in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan,” CPRA executive director Michael Hare said.. “We’re now moving from planning to action in one of the most vulnerable areas of our coast, where this investment will make a measurable difference.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9101-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)Enrollment at the University of New Orleans is down about 800 students this fall as the university deals with an ongoing fiscal crisis from a years-long enrollment slump. 
There are 5,670 students enrolled at the university this semester, UNO President Kathy Johnson said in a campuswide email  this week. The count is down about 12% from a year ago. 
“This number is lower than we’d hoped, yet understandable given the challenges we’ve experienced over the course of the past year,” Johnson said. “The future remains incredibly bright as we prepare to transition back to the LSU System with a realigned budget.” 
The decrease in enrollment at UNO has spanned two decades. The school had a student body of around 17,000 before Hurricane Katrina, with an immediate drop to around 6,000 after the storm. For several years before Johnson took over the university in 2023, university officials did not align spending with enrollment. The school faced a $30 million budget shortfall  last fiscal year and implemented a spending freeze, layoffs and staff furloughs in an attempt to make ends meet. 
The loss of students means UNO will bring in about $1 million less in revenue than anticipated, though Johnson said the university will not reduce its budget. Johnson said UNO would be “judicious” in replacing students and asked faculty and staff to refrain from purchases unless they are essentially or paid for with external funds. 
The enrollment decline comes as the school is preparing to transition back to the LSU System. The Louisiana Legislature passed a bill earlier this year to initiate the transfer, which would undo lawmakers’ decision to move the university from the LSU System to the University of Louisiana System 14 years ago. 
The first meeting of a transition committee to begin work on the transfer will be in early October, LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said. 
Lawmakers and university officials hope the transfer will have a positive impact on enrollment. Despite national trends of falling enrollment, every school in the LSU System has reported increasing, often record-breaking enrollment over the past several years.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller) Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball issued subpoenas to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services on Friday seeking information regarding an unfunded law that was passed to help kinship care families in 2024. 
This came four days after Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate dismissed Ball’s lawsuit that sought to make the cabinet implement Senate Bill 151 and cooperate with a related investigation. The law has been in limbo due to a $20 million funding dispute between the legislative and executive branches of government.
Judge dismisses suit seeking to unlock aid for Kentucky kinship care families. Now what?  

Wingate made the decision to dismiss Ball’s suit, in part, because he said the auditor had not yet exhausted her options to obtain information from the cabinet about why the state failed to implement the law. 
In his ruling, he said, “no subpoenas have been sought, (the Cabinet for Health and Family Services) has complied with many of the auditor’s requests and, finally, CHFS has asserted that the auditor ‘need only provide a name and CHFS will set up an interview just as it always has.’” 
On Friday, the auditor’s office issued subpoenas seeking:

All internal Cabinet for Health and Family Services communications and external communications to, from, among, or between the cabinet and Gov. Andy Beshear’s office, the Office of State Budget Director, the General Assembly, the Legislative Research Commission, the federal government, and “any other person or entity” about Senate Bill 151 and “its execution or the decision not to execute” it. 
All information, including but not limited to documentation and communications, about the Department for Community Based Services’ (DCBS) working budget showing actual expenditures and when, how much, for what purpose, and why any unrestricted funds became obligated in fiscal years 2025 and 2026.
A list of all DCBS programs not codified in state statute or delineated within 2024 House Bill 6 (the budget). 
And more.

In a statement Ball said “I continue fighting for Kinship caregivers and the children in their care” by issuing the subpoenas and “we look forward to their production of all documents and witnesses.”

Cooper, a Democrat who is now running for U.S. Senate, oversaw the passage of Medicaid expansion while serving as governor. He frequently touts it as one of the highlights of his eight-year administration.
“It doesn’t have anything to do with waste, fraud and abuse,” Cooper said, pushing back on Republicans’ arguments that the bill will cut trim costs and bureaucracy. “They were creating this … so they could give people tax breaks.”
His criticism of the GOP-led “big, beautiful bill” came during a roundtable focused on health care costs and Medicaid — one of his first public appearances since formally launching his bid for Senate. And Cooper criticized his Republican opponent Michael Whatley’s support of the package.
“D.C. is broken,” Cooper said. “It is absolutely chaotic and broken.”
Whatley, the former chair of the Republican National Committee, has called the bill “the embodiment of our agenda,” and said it should be a key part of Republican messaging going forward.

The position has been vacant since May when Marcus Thompson resigned as president less than two years into his tenure.
The state’s governing body which oversees Mississippi’s eight public universities voted Thursday during executive session at its annual retreat to select Association of Governing Board of Universities and Colleges Search, an executive headhunting firm based in Washington, D.C, to assist with naming the historically Black university’s next leader. 
The move is a departure from the IHL board’s usual pick, Academic Search, an executive firm they’ve used twice for past university president searches. 
In 2023, the board hired Academic Search for $115,000 after Thomas Hudson, Thompson’s predecessor, resigned. The board also paid the firm $85,000 for the Delta State search, which resulted in Dan Ennis. 
The firm presented a proposal that “best matched the qualifications outlined in the formal request for proposals,” a press statement from the board said. Trustees said it will iron out a formal contract with the firm in the next few days. 
In August, the board announced to the public it began its official search process three months after Thompson’s resignation. For months, alumni and supporters of the university have raised questions and called for a fair, transparent national leadership search for the university.

Mikie Sherrill has for months urged her GOP rival, Jack Ciattarelli, to release his tax returns, as she has. Friday, he did.","Jack Ciattarelli speaks at a town hall in Pitman on Sept. 16, 2025. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor) Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who’s running to become New Jersey’s next governor, gave the press a peek at 13 years of his federal tax returns Friday after escalating calls for financial disclosure from his Democratic opponent in the race, Rep. Mikie Sherrill.
The returns show that Ciattarelli, 63, a former state assemblyman who started and sold two medical publishing businesses, has made almost $14.9 million in income and paid almost $4 million in federal, state and local taxes since 2012.
His most profitable year came in 2017, when he retired and sold his second medical publishing business. That year, he reported almost $7.1 million in total income, the returns show. Otherwise, his total reported annual income fluctuated between $600,946 (in 2014) and more than $1.3 million (in 2016) before he retired, and $168,433 (in 2022) and $854,966 (in 2018) after he retired, the returns show.
The returns were joint returns, filed with his ex-wife Melinda. The couple’s divorce was finalized this year. She reported little income most years, with $22,138 of total income reported in 2024, the returns show.
Ciattarelli paid an average effective tax rate of 28% per year when he was working full-time, with a high of 38% in 2016, his campaign spokespeople said.
The campaign gave reporters two hours to view but not copy a towering stack of returns at Ciattarelli’s accountant’s office in Clinton. In an accompanying press release, Ciattarelli called the disclosure “an unprecedented level of transparency for any gubernatorial candidate ever.”
“Now, it’s Mikie Sherrill’s turn,” he said in a statement, urging her to release her returns back to 2018 when she was first elected to Congress.
Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, found the timing of the disclosures noteworthy — two days before the first gubernatorial debate of the general election, with Ciattarelli and Sherrill scheduled to square off at 7 p.m. Sunday at Rider in Lawrenceville.
“It’s definitely something that I would have liked to have seen earlier in the campaign, because we have a limited amount of time to weigh this stuff out, but we got it on the eve of the first debate,” he said. “It’s pretty obvious that the goal here is to not fall under the criticism on Sunday night that he hadn’t disclosed his taxes.”
But he applauded Ciattarelli for disclosing returns back to 2012, his first full year in the New Jersey Legislature. He served in the Assembly from December 2011 until January 2018, making an annual salary in that post of $49,000.
“I think that’s a good standard, is to say: ‘You saw my finances while I was in office,’” Rasmussen said.
Ciattarelli did not release his returns when he ran for governor in 2021. Then, he ran against incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy and came close to unseating him. He also ran for the post in 2017 but lost to then-Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno in the Republican primary.
Financial disclosures are important so voters can learn the sources of candidates’ income and any conflicts of interest and go to the ballot box armed with more information about the candidates, Rasmussen said.
The details of Ciattarelli’s finances could deflate his criticism of Sherrill as a wealthy politician who cashed in on her time in Congress, Rasmussen said.
“I think it sort of levels the playing field from the public perception,” Rasmussen said. “You can’t really say that Mikie’s the millionaire here, because they both are candidates who have significant assets and significant income and significant means. I’m not going to compare income brackets, but it puts them more or less at parity. They both are candidates with significant incomes.”
Sherrill and her husband, a broker at UBS Securities, reported roughly $3.2 million in income for 2024, their tax returns say. They were billed $1.08 million in federal income tax; $279,010 in New York state income tax (UBS Securities is based in New York City); and $29,002 in New Jersey state income tax in 2024.

Board members, from left: Pamela Clancy Ammar, Neelima Parasker, Diana Mendoza, Blake Benson, Blake Flanders (board CEO), Kathy Wolfe Moore and Alysia Johnston. Board member John Dicus isn't visible. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents paused review of a proposal from Kansas State University to offer a 90 credit hour bachelor’s degree in uncrewed aircraft systems that necessitated waiver of state policy mandating 120 hours of course credit to earn an undergraduate degree.
The hesitancy resulted from questions about how approval of K-State’s plan could alter the academic landscape of the state’s system of 32 public universities, community colleges and technical colleges. On Thursday, members of the Board of Regents raised issues with how potential students and higher education institutions, as well as business and industry, might respond if Kansas amended the foundational premise of a four-year degree.
The Board of Regents agreed to convene a task force to consider development of a systemwide policy before taking up proposals to sidestep existing rules requiring a bachelor’s degree to represent at least 120 credit hours of study.
“We don’t want to stymie the process,” said Alysia Johnston, a member of the Board of Regents. “This needs a whole lot of thought and input.”
Jesse Perez Mendez, provost at K-State, said the university welcomed the opportunity to participate in the task force’s debate. He said the drone bachelor’s degree for K-State’s aviation campus in Salina had been under consideration along with reduced-credit degrees related to artificial intelligence.
“This is a little bit of a game changer overall and we need to be very cautious,” Mendez said. “What this conversation is not about? It’s not about taking a bachelor’s degree in psychology and reduce that down to three years. It’s with degrees we don’t have on the books.”
He said K-State was committed to collaborating with two-year community colleges and technical colleges on alternative degree offerings.
Board of Regents policy, but not state law, established a bachelor’s degree consist of at least 120 credit hours. Policy says 45 credits must be in upper-division courses. Kansas higher education has been under pressure to recruit students as the U.S. college-age population fell. At the same time, the cost of delivering college instruction kept escalating with inflation.
Heather Morgan, executive director of the Kansas Community College Association, said the 19 community colleges in Kansas had taken a keen interest in reform of laws or policies related to reduced-credit degrees.
She said issues to consider included retention of policy permitting community college students to transfer credits in core subject classes to a university. Supplemental degree models should respond to industry demands and tap into combined potential of the state’s higher education institutions, she said.
“One of the things we’ve been talking about is how do we use the assets we already have more efficiently and deploy expertise from a faculty perspective across all our colleges,” Morgan said.
 
Unanswered questions
Rusty Monhollon, vice president for academic affairs with the state Board of Regents, said the system had sought for the past decade to increase on-time graduation rates by reducing baccalaureate programs to 120 credit hours. The percentage of undergraduate programs in the Board of Regents system with more than 120 required credit hours decreased from 67% to 8%.
Nationally, he said, the movement to accredit reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees was deepening. In September 2024, the Higher Learning Commission, which accredits Kansas colleges and universities, released guidelines reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees.
Since March, nine U.S. colleges received HLC accreditation of alternative degrees. The list included business administration, information technology, pre-physical therapy, pre-athletic training, fashion business management, semiconductor materials and devices and applied cybersecurity.
“Proponents of these degrees claim they are affordable and match up well with workplace skills demand,” Monhollon said. “Others dismiss them, arguing industry does not recognize them and that they lack the scope and the depth of traditional bachelor’s degrees.”
He offered a range of questions that might be weighed: Would three-year degrees be valued by students, industry and in academic circles? Could reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees cheapen the value of a four-year degree? What would be cut — basic subjects or advanced classes — to shrink course requirements? What should a reduced-credit degree be called? Could Kansas run a pilot program to test supply and demand? What was the range for reduced-credit programs — 90 to 105 credit hours? How would it impact the system’s general education agreements? How should graduate school process applications from students with three-year degrees?
“Not all segments could fit into the three-year degree,” said Neelima Parasker, a member of the Board of Regents. “We have to go to industry and ask them for their feedback instead of just floating this and seeing what they do.”
 
‘Huge mistake’
Blake Benson, chairman of the Board of Regents, said he was curious if estimates could be made for how many new students would enroll in the state’s public education system if reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees were an option.
Board of Regents member Diana Mendoza said the term used to describe a reduced-credit degree was consequential. She asked if it could be referred to as a workforce specialist degree to help potential employers differentiate between three- and four-year diplomas.
Kathy Wolfe Moore, another member of the state board, said she was concerned Kansas’ higher education system could become “a bit of a slave to the employment fluctuations” in the business cycle.
“I’m quite sure this board … would have no interest in moving our system backward,” said Blake Flanders, who serves as CEO and president of the Board of Regents.
Flanders said expansion of reduced-credit degree programs in Kansas would be complex, but possible if crafted with attention to detail. The cost of eroding confidence in the value of a Kansas bachelor’s degree could be significant, he said.

A set of orders issued Friday moved the case forward to the high court, which will take up an appeal from the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi. That case also includes several clean water and environmental advocates as plaintiffs. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The court will also hear a separate appeal from Flow Water Advocates, regarding the Michigan Public Service Commission’s decision to grant a permit for the Line 5 tunnel.
Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline has long been a point of concern for Indigenous tribes and environmentalists in the Great Lakes region, namely due to the 4.5 mile segment split into a dual set of pipelines running through the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet.
With Line 5 transporting 22 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids through the straits daily, pipeline opponents have called the 72-year-old pipeline a ticking time bomb, warning of catastrophic results should the pipelines rupture.
Enbridge identified gaps in the pipeline’s coating in 2014. The dual pipelines have also been hit by two anchor strikes since 2018 denting the pipeline in three places, damaging a support and prompting further concerns about the safety of Line 5.
The state and Enbridge later agreed that the company would replace the dual pipelines with a new segment located inside a concrete lined tunnel buried beneath the lakebed. However Line 5’s opponents have continued to call for the pipeline to be shut down, arguing the tunnel’s design carries risk for explosion, while the construction of the tunnel itself carries its own risks for environmental harm.
To move forward, Enbridge must receive permits from three agencies: the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
The Michigan Public Service Commission, which regulates energy providers and energy infrastructure, approved permitting for the tunnel project in 2023. However, that decision was quickly challenged by the coalition of tribes and environmentalists.
Pipeline opponents have argued the Public Service Commission failed to make determinations required by the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, had improperly excluded evidence while considering the permit and failed to consider alternatives to the pipeline outside of the Straits of Mackinac. But the Michigan Court of Appeals ultimately upheld the regulatory body’s decision.
Carrie La Seur, the legal director for Flow Water advocates, celebrated the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the appeal.
“This is an incredibly important step forward for the protection of the Great Lakes,” La Seur said in a statement. “The public trust doctrine is a fundamental principle of Michigan law that must be considered in decisions that affect our natural resources. We are eager to argue this case and ensure that our state’s waters are protected for generations to come.”
Bay Mills Indian Community President Whitney Gravelle argued that, tunnel or no tunnel, Line 5 still poses a threat to the waters of the Great Lakes and the culture of tribal nations. 
“The tunnel project and the dual pipelines are just two versions of one terrible idea that threatens to destroy our clean water, our fishing, and our way of life for the sake of Canadian profits,” Gravelle said in a statement. “Our choice is not between the dual pipelines and the tunnel. Our choice is between an oil spill in the Great Lakes and a clean water future for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. We simply want government officials to consider the safest, cheapest, and most common-sense alternative: Decommission Line 5.”
Matt Helms, the spokesperson for the Michigan Public Service Commission said the body would not comment on the pending legislation. 
Enbridge did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication. 
While Enbridge received permits from EGLE in 2021, the company is awaiting a decision from the department following a required redo of its water resources permit. The tunnel project is also awaiting permitting from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with President Donald Trump’s Administration working to fast track approval.

After being charged huge markups by massive drug middlemen, the department replaced them with a different arrangement that provided greater transparency and increased pharmacy reimbursements. Despite the increase, the new system saved $140 million over two years, the department’s actuarial firm reported.
“I wish Director Corcoran the very best in this next chapter,” DeWine said in a written statement. “Maureen has served the people of Ohio well throughout her career in public service, and I am grateful to her dedication and commitment to her fellow Ohioans.”

(Photo by Kelly Winter for Utah News Dispatch)Almost all public universities advanced in the Utah Legislature’s mandated process to cut “inefficient” programs in order to direct their funding into high-demand course offerings that may lead to higher paying jobs. 
But Utah State University, which is undergoing a leadership transition and included in its original plans its intent to expand its nursing program, didn’t make the cut. 
Hooper Republican House Speaker Mike Schultz said during an interim executive appropriations meeting on Monday he had concerns about the reinvestment plans the school has presented so far as required by a 2025 law that ordered universities to cut 10% of their budget for courses and then allocate the funds to expand programs that may have waitlists.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This is the last step the universities had to go through before implementing their reinvestment plans. But USU’s plans have been deferred until a new university president presents a revised plan.
Budget bills targeting ‘underperforming’ university programs press forward

“I have a hard time understanding why we would be expanding into nursing into Utah State University. You have Weber State up there that has a fantastic program already in northern Utah,” Schultz said. “To me, it just seems duplicative and kind of goes against what we’re trying to accomplish.
According to a Utah System of Higher Education presentation, health care is the No. 1 category the public universities system as a whole has identified for its reinvestment funds. So far, plans are to allocate 32.6% of the joint reinvestment account for that area. 
Nursing was one of the study areas a legislative audit — which helped inform the new law — specifically identified as in high demand. 
But that need isn’t a fact that Schultz contested during the Monday meeting. For him, the issue was that other institutions could pick up that expansion. That, in addition to the amount of new schools and administrative roles that Utah State University proposed. 
Within the reinvestment process, Utah State University has to cut and reallocate at least $12.5 million from its current budget. In the current plan, the largest chunk of the money will go to what the school describes as “technologies and careers of the future,” which includes a new school of computing, a new chemical engineering program, an AI center and an aviation expansion.



Let us know what you think...


 


A big portion of the funds is also going to health and well-being workforce, including $1.2 million allocated to expand mental health programs, $1 million for a nursing expansion, $775,000 for a new college of health and human sciences, and $385,300 for a new doctor of physical therapy. 
With Utah State University being the state’s sole land-grant institution, Schultz said, it is “uniquely set up to be doing natural resources, and working hard on natural resources; energy, critical minerals. These are things that are so important to our economy right now, and Utah’s leading out on so many of these things already.”
Schultz was also disappointed to not see more about agriculture innovation research in the plans, he said.
Alan Smith, interim president of USU, said the university is still investing in areas like energy engineering, chemical engineering and other mining programs. Some of that investment is part of this specific initiative, but funding for them also comes from other ongoing state investment.
Last year when the university doubled its space for pre-nursing majors to 120 spots a year, they were filled immediately, Smith said.
“We’d like to expand on that, because there’s a clear, strong interest and a strong need throughout the state, and I think there’s room for multiple institutions to have strength there,” Smith said. “We welcome Weber being in that arena, the U. being in that arena, and others, because there’s a true shortage.”
Despite those concerns, the decision to defer the approval of USU’s reinvestment plans was expected, said Amanda DeRito, the university’s associate vice president for strategic communications.
At each step of the process with the Utah Board of Higher Education and other legislative panels, “approval of Utah State University’s plan was conditional on approval from our next president,” she said in a statement.

The first commercial offshore wind farm in the United States, located 3.8 miles from Block Island, was developed by Deepwater Wind, now known as Ørsted US Offshore Wind. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)The developers of the Revolution Wind project and two attorneys general whose states were set to buy its electricity both filed lawsuits contending the same thing on the same day — that the Trump administration violated its constitutional powers in halting construction on the project — but in different venues. 
On Sept. 4, the developers took their case challenging the Aug. 22 stop work order to Washington D.C. Hours later, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong appealed to the Rhode Island federal courts to revive work on the 65-turbine project.
How many lawsuits does it take to restart Revolution Wind? More than one.

Ahead of a Monday hearing in D.C. on the developers’ lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice is seeking to transfer the AGs case from Rhode Island to D.C., and consolidate the two complaints into one.
A 14-page motion filed on Wednesday in federal court in Rhode Island points to the similarities between the two lawsuits, as well as the D.C. court’s existing knowledge of the project, which has already been subject of legal complaints by the Preservation Society of Newport County and Green Oceans, a citizen-led anti-wind group based in Little Compton.
“Given the significant overlap between Revolution Wind and the States’ claims and requested relief, as well as [District of D.C.]’s existing familiarity with the Project and the issues raised in the States’ complaint, this Court should transfer this case to [the District of DC,]” Justice Department lawyers wrote. “Federal Defendants thus expeditiously move to transfer this case to D.D.C. to ensure the two cases can be litigated efficiently and to avoid inconsistent judgments on the same set of facts and issues.”
Megan Skinner, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said in an email Friday the AGs will submit a written response to the court by Oct. 1.
However, in the initial complaint filed in Rhode Island, Neronha and Tong justified the decision to file in Rhode Island, rather than D.C. because of the Ocean State’s proximity to the project. Revolution Wind sits 15 nautical miles south of Rhode Island, with the bulk of the port activity transferring workers and equipment to and from the project taking place in Rhode Island and Connecticut. More than 1,000 union laborers across both states now stand to lose the jobs they already lined up if the project does not resume. The abrupt halt to the project has also put both states’ climate change mandates in jeopardy and could cost regional ratepayers more than $500 million a year without the 704 megawatts of renewable energy the project is set to produce at its maximum.
“A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred and continues to occur within Rhode Island,” the AGs wrote. “Rhode Island is the “State nearest the place the cause of action arose.”
While the project developers have also described environmental and labor consequences in their own lawsuit, their case features much more information about the financial losses the companies will incur on their $5 billion investment — $2 million in losses a day on work and equipment contracts for every day of the pause, along with an estimated $1 billion in “breakaway costs” if the project is canceled.
Chris Raia, a spokesperson for Ørsted, the co-developer of the project, declined to comment Friday, citing the pending litigation.
U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy, who is presiding over the AGs case in Rhode Island, has not indicated when she will rule on the Justice Department’s request to transfer the case, according to the public court docket. The clerk’s office did not immediately respond to questions Friday.

Doug Clemens of St. Ann spoke with Boeing employees on strike on Aug. 5 outside of company facility in Berkeley, Missouri. (Photo by Rebecca Rivas/The Missouri Independent)Boeing union workers on strike in the St. Louis area voted Friday to approve a union-proposed contract, after overwhelmingly rejecting Boeing’s settlement offer last week.
The four-year contract, proposed by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837, includes a $10,000 ratification bonus  compared to the $4,000 bonus Boeing proposed. It also addresses one of the workers’ biggest concerns – pay raises for top-of-scale members and 401(k) benefits. 
“Our members stood up with courage and voted for a fair, responsible pathway to end this strike,” said IAM Union International President Brian Bryant in a statement Friday. “Now, Boeing must honor that decision, accept this deal, and show respect for the skilled workers who are the backbone of its defense business.”
The union’s proposed ratification bonus is lower than what the $12,000 Boeing employees in Seattle received last year after a seven-week strike, said Jonathan Battaglia, spokesman for the IAM Union. However, the 401(k) benefits are the same as those Seattle workers received, he said. 
About 3,200 Boeing workers who assemble advanced aircraft and weapons systems at the company’s facilities in St. Louis, St. Charles and Mascoutah, Ill. have been on strike since Aug. 4.
Earlier this week, Boeing officials called the vote on the union contract a “publicity stunt” and told workers it was a “waste of your time.” 
Dan Gillian, Boeing St. Louis vice president of air dominance, said in a statement Friday that the company’s last offer would make workers the “highest paid manufacturing employees in the St. Louis area.”
“We want all 3,200 of you back at work as soon as possible,” Gillian said. “But that has to happen with a contract that makes sense in the Midwest, not the Pacific Northwest. Our previous offer is far more lucrative than other recently ratified contracts for complex manufacturing work in our region.”
He pointed to GE Aerospace and the IAM union in Cincinnati that ratified a five-year contract with general wage increases of 19.5% over five years. Boeing’s last offer was 24% over five years.  
Gillian said this week that Boeing is open to further discussions, but the “overall economics of our offer will not improve.”
Missouri Democratic Congressmen Wesley Bell of St. Louis and Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, along with members of the Congressional Labor Caucus, urged Boeing this week to return to the bargaining table. 
“These workers—among the most talented in their fields—deliver quality products that serve the entire nation, and the world,” said Bell and Cleaver in a letter to Boeing president and CEO Kelly Ortberg. “If an agreement is not reached soon, the loss of income, healthcare, and other essential resources could cause hardships not seen since 1997.” 
Last week, the union workers voted to reject Boeing’s settlement second offer that the company touts as offering 45% average wage growth. The workers said that it wasn’t much different than the company’s first offer in August that caused the strike.
Chad Stevenson, a plant chairman for the union at the St. Louis facility, told The Independent in August that the company’s offer wouldn’t equally benefit the longtime workers who endured pay freezes when the company’s contracts were “lean” over the last several years.
“Our members took concessions to help this company and continued to produce the same amount and the same quality of work,” said Stevenson, who works as an assembly mechanic. “So really it was over eight years, top-scale wasn’t raised.”
The union’s proposed contract includes an hourly increase for two of the four years, instead of “lump sum” amounts that Boeing proposed. Battaglia said employees prefer the $1.50 hourly increase because it “builds on each other,” unlike the lump sum.
“Our members have spoken loudly — we are ready to return to work once Boeing accepts this agreement,” said IAM District 837 Directing Business Representative Tom Boelling in a union statement Friday. “It’s up to the company to get our members back to what they do best: building world-class aircraft for our nation’s defense.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2976-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 14:58:41.545302

Tahesha Way requires landlords inform their tenants of lead risks and failed lead tests.,"From left, a lead pipe, a corroded steel pipe, and a lead pipe treated with protective orthophosphate. Lead pipes cause health problems and drive up water bills. (Photo courtesy Environmental Protection Agency)Landlords will be required to report the presence of lead water lines to their tenants under a bill Acting Gov. Tahesha Way signed into law Friday.
The new law requires landlords to disclose to current and prospective tenants whether water utilities have said their rental unit is serviced by lines that may contain lead and whether the unit is old enough to contain lead piping. It also requires landlords to provide to tenants copies of notices within the last three years that found lead levels exceeded acceptable levels in the unit’s service area.
“With this bill, we’re protecting New Jerseyans in their communities,” said Way. “No child or adult should ever be forced to live with the detrimental and lasting health effects caused by lead poisoning from their homes.”
Way, who is lieutenant governor and secretary of state, is acting governor while Gov. Phil Murphy is abroad on a trade mission to India.
Lead exposure can cause serious health risks, particularly in children, who risk developmental delays, behavioral changes, and other physical and neurological symptoms when exposed to the metal, typically over months or years.
The new law also allows residents to request their utility test their water for lead. If lead levels are within acceptable bounds, utilities must only conduct that test once a year at a given property. If lead levels are too high, the utility must retest every 60 days until lead levels are acceptable in two consecutive tests.
“Lead contamination is prevalent in all regions across the state, and it is crucial that we protect the health of our New Jersey families,” said Assemblyman Gary Schaer (D-Passaic), the bill’s chief Assembly sponsor. “Some of the oldest residential structures in New Jersey are in our urban communities, like Passaic, which are disproportionately impacted by lead contamination in water service lines.”
The new law, which sailed through both legislative chambers in unanimous votes, gives the Departments of Health, Community Affairs, and Environmental Protection six months to develop a notice informing residents about the risks of lead exposure and waterborne lead, including information on protective measures.
Landlords must begin informing their residents of properties’ lead risks in the 90 days after the departments draft that notice. They would not be required to issue similar notices for lease renewals after the initial wave.
Real estate agents are not responsible for providing those notices unless they are also the property’s landlord.
Lead water lines have been federally banned since 1986, though many aging homes around New Jersey still contain them.
A lead line replacement program launched in Newark in 2019, three years after tests found elevated lead levels in Newark schools, replaced roughly 23,000 lead pipes.

Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) have written to the chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to criticize the agency’s chairman’s attacks on late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel.
ABC television, part of Disney, suspended Kimmel’s show indefinitely Wednesday after criticism of the comedian’s remarks that FCC Chair Brendan Carr made on a right-wing podcast.
On his program, “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Monday and Tuesday, Kimmel made several comments about last week’s shooting of Charlie Kirk, including the statement that “many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.”
The Associated Press reported the suspension was announced after a group of ABC affiliates said they would not air Kimmel’s program and after Carr suggested on the Benny Johnson podcast Wednesday that the FCC was considering taking action against the network.
In a letter Thursday, 11 Democratic senators, including Baldwin, told Carr, “You proceeded to threaten that the FCC ‘can do this the easy way or the hard way,’ and telegraphed that ‘there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead’ unless ABC affiliates ‘find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel . . .’”
“It is not simply unacceptable for the FCC Chairman to threaten a media organization because he does not like the content of its programming — it violates the First Amendment that you claim to champion,” the senators wrote.
“The FCC’s role in overseeing the public airwaves does not give it the power to act as a roving press censor, targeting broadcasters based on their political commentary,” they added. “But under your leadership, the FCC is being weaponized to do precisely that.”
The letter calls Carr’s statements “a betrayal of the FCC’s mission,” suggesting that he was trying to police speech and “force broadcasters to adopt political viewpoints that you favor,” and “requiring them to act in ‘Trump’s interest’” rather than in the public interest, as called for in the Federal Communications Act.
The letter notes that Nextar — which operates 23 ABC affiliates according to the AP and has a merger pending before the FCC — announced it would take Kimmel’s show off the air. Disney then announced it was suspending Kimmel’s show indefinitely.
“This is precisely what government censorship looks like,” the senators wrote.
Carr’s comments were an about-face from a 2022 post on X, when he defended late-night comedians and political satirists and “rightly rejected government censorship as a threat to our First Amendment protections,” the senators wrote. “But as FCC Chairman, you now have apparently forgotten these principles.”
The letter demands that by Sept. 25, Carr answer three questions in writing: about the FCC’s public interest standard and its definitions of political bias; whether the agency has communicated with Disney, ABC or their affiliates about Kimmel and his show; and what he meant by “the hard way” and “the easy way” in his podcast remarks.
The letter was led by Sen. Edward Markey (D-Massachusetts). In addition to Baldwin it was signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Washington), Ben Ray Lujan (D-New Mexico), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Delaware), John Hickenlooper (D-Colorado), Gary Peters (D-Michigan), Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota).

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Supporters of South Dakota’s law barring the use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines are pushing back after North Dakota’s attorney general suggested his state might challenge the measure in court.
In an interview published Thursday, Fargo radio station The Flag (WZFG) asked North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley if he would file a lawsuit against South Dakota. Wrigley said his office is “examining all possibilities.” He also criticized South Dakota’s law, calling it a “bad policy choice” and a “hostile act.”
“To have a nation, you have to have commerce between, around and across states,” Wrigley said. “There are limitations on what one state can do that then would make them the regulator of the nation, so to speak.”

The South Dakota legislation, signed into law in March, prohibits the use of eminent domain for carbon pipeline projects. Eminent domain is the legal right to access private property for projects that benefit the public, with compensation for landowners determined by a court. It’s commonly used for projects such as electrical power lines, water pipelines, oil pipelines and highways.
The change effectively blocked Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions from constructing its proposed $9 billion pipeline across South Dakota to connect ethanol plants in that state, as well as Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska, with plants and an underground storage site in North Dakota. The project would capitalize on federal tax credits incentivizing the prevention of heat-trapping emissions into the atmosphere.
Summit has since sought to remove language from its Iowa permit conditioning the start of construction on approvals in the Dakotas. The project has permits not only in Iowa but also in North Dakota and Minnesota, while Nebraska has no permitting process for the project and South Dakota regulators have twice rejected Summit’s applications. Summit did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. 
South Dakota’s Speaker of the House, Rep. Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, criticized Wrigley’s comments. Hansen, one of several candidates for governor next year, was one of the sponsors of the eminent domain ban and voted for it. He is campaigning with his running mate, Rep. Karla Lems, R-Canton, the bill’s prime sponsor in the House.
“Let’s call this what it is,” Hansen wrote on social media. “It appears the carbon pipeline lobbyists have found their latest puppet — and now North Dakota taxpayers might be forced to bankroll a lawsuit against their own neighbors in South Dakota, all to help a private carbon pipeline company.” 
Pipeline opponents call for Iowa regulators to reject Summit’s proposed permit changes

Sen. Mark Lapka, R-Leola, the bill’s prime sponsor in the South Dakota Senate, defended the legislation. He said the bill “in no way, shape or form” prevents a carbon pipeline from being built in South Dakota but instead gives landowners an option.
“They now have the ability to choose whether they want to participate in something, or — if it does not work out for their best interests — they have the opportunity to say no,” Lapka said.
Republican South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley’s office would be responsible for defending the state if a lawsuit is filed.
“I will defend the laws and people of South Dakota, it’s as simple as that,” Jackley said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight. “The Legislature voted for the private property rights by wide margins, and Gov. Rhoden signed it into law. The people of South Dakota voted decisively on this issue, and I will support them.”
Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden’s office referred Searchlight to a letter he sent legislators in March explaining his decision to sign the bill. The letter referenced “easements,” which are land access agreements, and made a distinction between voluntary easements and the involuntary kind that could come with eminent domain. 
“South Dakota landowners feel strongly that the threat of involuntary easements for the proposed carbon dioxide pipeline infringes on their freedoms and their property rights,” Rhoden wrote in the letter.

Local businesses, UW’s student paper, a Teton County daily among those in the fray.
The post Charlie Kirk killing fuels free speech disputes in Wyoming as newspapers come under attack appeared first on WyoFile .","Two days after an assassin shot and killed Charlie Kirk, the student newspaper at the University of Wyoming published two stories about the conservative activist who’d visited Laramie’s campus only a few months before. 
One was a reported news story, the other an opinion column. Both were written by Charles Vaughters, editor-in-chief of The Branding Iron. As is happening in communities across the U.S. in the days since Kirk’s killing, they would provoke outrage and debate over freedom of speech amid growing concerns about political violence. And that rancor, at least in Wyoming, wouldn’t stop with the Brandon Iron.
In the editorial, Vaughters described his experience attending Kirk’s April UW visit. 
“During the entirety of the event, Kirk repeatedly stressed that he only wanted what was best for America, and I believed him,” Vaughters wrote.
The student journalist, who voted for Trump, said he and Kirk “may have had some disagreements on certain policy issues,” but he thought “the man was genuine in his belief that he was doing what was right for the country.” 
The same day Vaughters sat down to pen his editorial, he wrote, the paper asked students on campus what they thought of Kirk’s death. “Most were sympathetic, and you can read their quotes in this very paper,” Vaughters wrote. 
One student, however, was particularly baffling to the paper, Vaughters wrote. The student, “who repeatedly refused to identify themself, basically said that this was a good thing. That Charlie Kirk deserved to die for harboring fascist and racist beliefs.”
“We found that absolutely disgusting,” Vaughters wrote, adding that the paper does “not condone any acts of political violence” and prides itself “on including opinion pieces from writers on every side of the political aisle, should they want to get their voices out there.” 
Vaughters concluded by asking readers to pray for Kirk.
A few hours after the paper was printed and distributed across campus, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus took to social media. The group represents the further right flank of the Republican Party, and its lawmakers control the Wyoming House of Representatives. 
“Why is the UW student newspaper platforming students who support political assassinations? This level of indifference toward human life is dangerous and unacceptable,” the caucus posted on both Facebook and X.

The Facebook post, in particular, erupted into a sprawling, and at times strained, virtual debate. More than 500 comments piled on, many weighing in on the bounds of free speech. Some pointed to the perceived political leanings of the University of Wyoming, saying they would no longer support the school. Several commenters echoed the caucus’ criticism of the paper. 
Others focused on the unnamed student. Some called on the student to be identified, to be expelled, to be watched, to have their gun rights stripped. Others said the student should be free to voice their opinion. 
Quote sparks more controversy
The next day, another virtual cycle began.
After the Cowboy State Daily, the state’s largest news organization, published a story about the student paper and campus reactions to Kirk’s killing, the Freedom Caucus singled out a graduate student quoted in that story, posting her photograph on its social media feeds. 
“Charlie Kirk, in his heart, thought he was doing the right thing, but I think he also spread a lot of horrible rhetoric,” Cowboy State Daily quoted the grad student saying. “I’m not happy to see him murdered in front of his family at all, but I’m also aware that I think I was happy to have his voice out of the spotlight.” 
(Both the graduate student and the editor-in-chief declined WyoFile’s request for interviews.) 
Again, hundreds of comments poured in, split on freedom of speech and what, if any, repercussions the student should face. Some were outraged at the student, and questioned why the public would pay for the salary of someone with her opinions. But for others, even staunch Republicans, the matter came down to the need to protect speech, regardless of whether they found it callous. 
“I’m really struggling to understand why the Freedom Caucus wants to vilify speech. I mean really struggling!” one commenter wrote. “I am a staunch conservative. A constitutionalist to the core. The Republican party is typically too centrist for me, but this is insane! I mourn CK as well. But this is not the answer. It’s like we are doxing people for the rhetoric we don’t agree with in an effort to effectively ‘cancel’ them. Sound like any other party we know?!”
As a conservative activist, Kirk rose to prominence in part for taking on the country’s higher education system for what he saw as policing conservative speech and producing an out-of-control cancel culture. He was perhaps best known for visiting college campuses and inviting students and staff to publicly question and debate him. He also launched an online watchlist in 2016 that targeted university professors who were believed to “discriminate against conservative students, promote anti-American values and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.” 
UW and the Freedom Caucus
The Facebook posts focusing on The Branding Iron and the grad student weren’t the first time the Wyoming Freedom Caucus has been critical of the  University of Wyoming. In fact, the group has a lengthy history challenging the state’s lone four-year public university.
In late 2022, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus caucus criticized the university for revoking a church leader’s tabling privileges after he targeted a transgender student by name in a sign in the Wyoming Union breezeway. 
“It is clear that the University of Wyoming has impermissibly silenced the protected speech of a Wyoming citizen,” the caucus said in a statement at the time. “The Wyoming Freedom Caucus will not allow Wyoming’s lone land-grant university to bow to the cancel mob. The recent actions of the University of Wyoming are out of step with the people of our State.”

The caucus also pointed ahead to the 2023 session in the statement as an opportunity for “our caucus together with other likeminded legislators to examine closely how the University of Wyoming is spending public dollars. The session will also allow for the legislature to pursue meaningful oversight of the University.”
Two years later, the Legislature voted to cut the school’s block grant and forbade it from spending that appropriation on its Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. More recently, Freedom Caucus members have expressed interest in having more of a say in the school’s spending as part of its plans to “DOGE” the state budget.
Asked to what extent the Freedom Caucus remains concerned about freedom of speech on UW’s campus, the group’s chair, Cody Republican Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, told WyoFile in a statement, “the right of these troubled students to celebrate Charlie Kirk’s murder does not limit the right of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus to call them out for it.”
“Students are free to say what they want — and we are free to call out any state employee who supports political assassinations,” she wrote. “It is completely within the realm of the First Amendment to point out that Wyoming taxpayers are paying someone who celebrated the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Doing so is an aspect of freedom itself.”

Comments and firings
What’s happening in Laramie is a reflection of a larger trend. Across the country, many Republicans are carrying out a campaign to expose and punish those whose comments on Kirk are deemed inappropriate. 
Numerous professionals, from government employees to teachers and college professors, have reportedly lost their jobs for posting comments critical of Kirk, according to PBS NewsHour. 
“When you see someone celebrating Charlie’s murder, call them out. And hell, call their employer,” Vice President JD Vance said while hosting The Charlie Kirk Show podcast on Monday. “We don’t believe in political violence, but we believe in civility. There is no civility in the celebration of political assassination.” 
Firings have been reported in various professions. One of the more high-profile dismissals involved Disney’s decision this week to remove late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel from the air waves after he commented on Kirk’s accused assassin.
Cartoon provokes backlash
Closer to home, at least two local businesses in Lander have faced harassment for online comments posted by their owners. In Jackson, the local newspaper company temporarily closed its doors after a syndicated cartoon printed in its weekend edition of the Jackson Hole Daily sparked outrage. 
“Our front office door is locked,” read a sign earlier this week on the door of Teton Media Works, the umbrella company for both the Jackson Hole News&Guide and Jackson Hole Daily. 
“After receiving multiple threats of violence against our employees, we will be glad to assist you via phone or email.”
The publication removed the cartoon from its digital edition and one of its editors apologized to readers, explaining that they understood the cartoon “to suggest that Kirk’s assination might be a turning point in our nation’s divide,” and “as a statement that the United States is at a turning point as a nation, where political violence is escalating at an alarming rate.” 
The company’s owners also published a letter to readers Wednesday. 
“To move forward, we will use this fracture of trust to ensure everything we do reflects our publishing principles: Seek the truth and report it. Minimize harm. Act independently. Be accountable and transparent,” the letter reads. “We have changed internal content review, and we have re-engineered editing processes to uphold these values.”
Chip Bok, the right-leaning cartoonist who produced the cartoon, took a different tone following uproar in other states where his cartoon was published in local papers. 
“My agenda as a cartoonist is basically free speech. That made Charlie Kirk my kind of guy,” Bok wrote on his website. 
“Here’s my apology: I’m sorry Charlie Kirk isn’t around to give these guys a free speech lesson.” 
The Wyoming Democratic Party on Thursday warned of a crackdown on free speech.
“Free speech is a core American value — and one that Charlie Kirk himself championed,” the party said in a press release. “That’s why, even as we condemn the horrific shooting in the strongest possible terms, we cannot stand by while politicians in Washington and here in Wyoming use this tragedy to crack down on free speech.”
The party also accused the Freedom Caucus of turning “this tragedy into a McCarthy-style witch hunt” for its decision to target the student paper and a graduate student. 
“It will take all of us, across the political spectrum pushing back to protect our constitutional rights,” the party wrote. 
Some suggested a simple solution, and one often advocated by Kirk himself: more speech.
On Wide Right Turn, one of the state’s conservative podcasts, host Joey Correnti and Sheridan Republican Rep. Tom Kelly described their horror with “those celebrating and rationalizing the assassination” as well as their disappointment with “those on the right espousing a desire for revenge” in Tuesday’s episode. 
“Put the rage away,” Kelly said. “Do what Charlie would have wanted you to do, and keep talking.”

Ninety-five Democrats voted in favor of the resolution, 38 voted “present” and 22 did not vote. All 215 Republican votes were in support of the resolution. Four GOP members did not vote.Tensions emerged in Congress in the days since Kirk was fatally shot Sept. 10 while speaking on a Utah college campus. The resolution also came as President Donald Trump and his administration have sought to crack down on rhetoric surrounding Kirk’s death. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and members of the Cabinet plan to attend a memorial service for Kirk on Sunday in Arizona.“We passed a resolution to honor the life and legacy of Charlie Kirk, my late friend, the friend of so many in this chamber, and we called out political violence in America,” House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters in the U.S. Capitol following the vote.The Louisiana Republican recited the last line of the resolution, which says the House “calls upon all Americans ... to reject political violence, recommit to respectful debate, uphold American values, and respect one another as fellow Americans.” “Sadly, a number of Democrats could not bring themselves to vote for that,” Johnson said. “We have to let everybody make their own judgments about that.” In a Friday statement, Congressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke and members of the group said “violence has no place in our politics,” including the killing of Kirk. “At the same time, we must condemn violence without abandoning our right to speak out against ideas that are inconsistent with our values as Americans,” the New York Democrat and caucus members said, adding that they “strongly disagree with many of the beliefs Charlie Kirk promoted.” They also described the House resolution as “an attempt to legitimize Kirk’s worldview — a worldview that includes ideas many Americans find racist, harmful, and fundamentally un-American.”Friday’s passage came a day after the Senate passed a resolution — introduced by Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott — that designates Oct. 14, 2025, as a “National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk.” There was no roll call vote taken.Oct. 14 marks Kirk’s birthday. Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2025-09-19 14:58:41.545302

Gavin Newsom signed today extends California clean-energy programs while taking steps to shore up oil and gas production. It also opens the door to a Western energy grid.,"In summary
A set of laws Gov. Gavin Newsom signed today extends California clean-energy programs while taking steps to shore up oil and gas production. It also opens the door to a Western energy grid.


Gov. Gavin Newsom today signed a sweeping package of climate and energy policies to extend the cap-and-trade greenhouse gas emissions program, increase oil drilling and allow the state to create a Western regional electricity market. 
The overhaul that Newsom and top lawmakers negotiated in the final days of the legislative session amid heavy lobbying last week reflects urgency in the Democratic Party to preserve its climate goals while simultaneously reining in the surging gas and energy costs that have threatened to drive voters to the right. 
Lawmakers opened the session this year declaring a focus on making California more affordable, following a bruising national election for Democrats. The energy package was central to that goal, with progressives proposing to lower costs with industry regulations.
But after two years declaring special sessions targeting the oil and gas industry, Newsom began to warm up to them as oil refineries announced closures that could send gas prices spiking. As a result, one of the bills he signed Friday would boost domestic oil production in Kern County by approving a long-delayed environmental impact report for new wells. 
“We have to effectively transition,” Newsom said at an event in San Francisco. “This is not an ideological endeavor. We’re in the practical application business. We’ve got to manifest our ideals and our goals. So this lays it out. But it lays it out without laying tracks over folks.”
The biggest part of the complex package he signed were bills to extend the state’s cap and trade program, which since 2013 has put a price tag on carbon emissions. The program caps the amount of greenhouse gases that polluting industries can emit, and to a limited extent allows companies that cut emissions to sell permits to other companies that pollute. The program raises money for many of the state’s climate programs. 
The extension leaves the program largely the same, which disappointed environmental justice advocates who argued it has allowed oil and gas to continue polluting near low-income communities. In a nod to those concerns, Newsom also signed another bill in the package that creates a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.
He also signed two bills affecting the electricity grid. One would allow the state to create a Western regional energy market, allowing the state to trade more electricity with neighbors. 
Proponents, including mainstream environmental groups, say the idea would lower prices by allowing California producers to sell excess clean energy during times the state doesn’t need it — when it’s sunny, but not hot, for example, while importing power during heat waves and other high-demand times. 
The other bill aims to lower the cost of transmission infrastructure for customers by setting up a public financing system for building new power lines. It would also prevent some utilities’ wildfire mitigation costs from being passed on to customers, and replenish the state’s wildfire fund by $18 billion. The money, paid by shareholders and ratepayers over the next decade, is used to pay wildfire victims. 
The package Newsom signed leaves one imminent concern unaddressed: upcoming refinery closures. Negotiations late in the legislative session to keep two Bay Area refineries open have so far failed to produce any deals. 
Some Democrats simply didn’t want to give more to the oil industry, while others disagreed on how much support the state should provide, Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Suisun City Democrat, told CalMatters last week. Wilson had been pushing for the state to support the Valero refinery in Benicia that is now set to close by the end of the year without a deal, costing the city its largest private employer.

(Photo via Lone Peak Film Festival)A film festival geared toward showing “uplifting” movies and shorts is coming to Big Sky this weekend.
It’s the first year for the Lone Peak Film Festival in Big Sky, which will have six feature films and 16 shorts. The event will also include a mentorship program for local Native American filmmakers. 
Feature films include “Bring Them Home (Aiskótáhkapiyaaya),” “Lost Wolves of Yellowstone,” “Champions of the Golden Valley,” “Runa Simi,” “Sing Sing” and “Cutting Through the Rocks.”
The festival starts on Friday and runs through Sunday, with a mixture of free and paid events throughout the weekend.
“They’re all uplifting. So they all focus a light on the good in humanity. There’s no denying that there’s a lot of bad stuff going on,” said Daniel Glick, who helped found the festival. “But we also want to highlight that there are a lot of people who are trying to make the world a bit more sane and healthy too.”
The film festival is also in part sponsored by the state Department of Commerce, and Montana has long been a home for filmmakers. The state passed legislation earlier this year to extend a film tax credit and also sought to fix a problem, which was film tax credits getting sucked up by large productions, namely “Yellowstone.”
Senate Bill 326 brought by Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson sought to address the issue. It had a somewhat dramatic path before being signed by Gov. Greg Gianforte — the bill was killed and revived and drew significant floor discussion. It also was one of the final bills the legislature passed during the 2025 session.
“We need the big guys, but more importantly, we need the little guys too, to make sure that they grow and prosper,” Hertz said in a House Taxation committee meeting on April 15. “And it all works out for Montana. We also have additional incentives to hire veterans and Native Americans into the bill.”
SB 326 will provide $12 million per year to the film industry in Montana, and some of that money will go to Montana production companies and small filmmakers. The bill also extended the tax credit until 2045.
Movie productions are incredibly expensive, said Glick, who described a film he wants to shoot on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. The problem is, he said, without production credits, it’s hard to find investors, and he may be forced to shoot a film across the border in Canada.
“There’s a huge, huge appetite for people to make films here, like locals, every filmmaker in Montana that I know wants to make multiple films in Montana … all of them have stories set here in Montana. But without that kind of incentive, it’s just very hard to get the investment needed,” Glick said. “… Filmmaking is a high risk venture, and so you need people willing to take the risk. And those credits are a way to incentivize investors.”
Events like the Big Sky Film Festival in Missoula draw crowds, and the expectation is Lone Peak will too. Organizers of the Lone Peak event spent time in the Big Sky area, seeing if there was appetite in the community for the festival, Glick said.
“Pretty much all the way to everyone we talked to said, ‘Yeah, the community would love this.’” Glick said. “So we moved ahead. And it wasn’t until three months ago that we decided to actually pull the trigger and say, ‘We’re going to do it.’ So …it’s been a rocket ship since then.”
The festival will also include opportunities for those aspiring for careers in the filmmaking industry, including Chase Hall and Destini Vaile. They’ll get a chance to meet people and be mentees.
Hall is the son of a stuntman and said his dad has done stunts for major productions, including the “Magnificent 7” and “Yellowstone.” His interest came early.
“I was exposed to a decent amount of film sets,” Hall said on Thursday.
He said he was a little nervous about this weekend but excited for the mentorship. Hall is from Browning and graduated from Montana State University with a degree in film studies.
He said he likes to focus on the theme of identity, and a previous mentor observed the same in his work.
“They noticed my work kind of goes through exploring identity as a contemporary Native American, through the lens of surrealism,” Hall said.
Vaile recently finished her master’s of fine arts at the University of Montana. She’s created scripts for a couple of projects, including “Cereal,” which is about a 15-year old having a daily breakfast with her grandmother in the month before she died. 
“It’s a bit autobiographical, but, you know, somewhat fictionalized, to just draw out the core of the story … I was staying with her a lot, and we would just have breakfast in the morning and talk about things,” Vaile said. “So it’s kind of just trying to capture that moment.”
She also enjoyed the time she spent at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Sante Fe, New Mexico. There, she said, she had the ability to express a creative vision with the lens of her culture.
Her cohort at the University of Montana was all women, which she said was a good experience.

(Photo by Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)It’s been nearly three months since the constitutionally-mandated deadline for state lawmakers in Harrisburg to pass a budget. But partisan gridlock continues to hold up negotiations.
Republicans hold a majority in the Senate, while Democrats maintain a one-vote edge in the House. Both chambers must agree on a spending plan before Gov. Josh Shapiro can sign it.
Until then, money meant for counties’ safety net programs will be held up, potentially affecting local governments’ ability to provide services and programs aimed primarily at helping their communities’ most vulnerable residents. 
Pennsylvania is one of only two states that have been unable to pass some form of a budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year. The other is Michigan. In other states, lawmakers have reached deals on spending plans – or contingencies. North Carolina, for example, has passed a “mini-budget” bill that prevents disruptions in state operations. 
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

As the general assembly drags its feet, some funding that counties receive from the state for human service and safety net programs cannot go through. That’s led counties with smaller reserves to borrow funds, which they’ll have to pay interest on and may not be reimbursed for by the state, or cut services where allowed. 
Affected programs include senior services, drug and alcohol programs, child welfare services and health departments.
“It means the third-party providers are just going to get paid less until the budget is paid less and the counties are fully funded,” said Kyle Kopko, the executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania. “That’s varied from county to county. And those third-party providers that rely on those funds, that’s going to affect their bottom line and payrolls too.”
Kopko said that counties across the state have also had to halt travel reimbursements for employees, cut overtime or borrow money, which will lead to interest payments .

“That obviously impacts counties’ ability to provide human services in a timely manner, or in as robust of a manner as is required by law,” Kopko said.
Public schools are feeling the squeeze too, which may get much worse if the impasse drags on any longer.
While many counties are able to maintain spending, having recently collected property taxes, Kopko said that, come next month, school districts are going to face “some real financial pressures.”
Already, he said, some have foregone new textbook purchases or are cutting programs out of school hours in case the stalemate drags on even longer.
“Depending on the county, this can be a third or more of the budget,” Kopko said about state funding. “They are required to provide a wide range of services that are mandated by law, and they don’t have the resources because the state hasn’t taken action. We’re still trying to wrap our heads around how much money is at play.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Divided legislature brings partisan politics into the mix
Both parties have been tight-lipped about what progress has and hasn’t been made, and what the largest obstacles to a compromise are.
But each side has made one thing clear: the partisan disagreements over how to approach the budget run deep.”
“House Democrats, even with a razor-thin majority, have demonstrated time and time again that we want to work together and compromise with Senate Republicans to pass legislation that moves Pennsylvania forward,” Beth Rementer, a spokesperson for House Democrats said. “Unfortunately during this budget cycle, Senate Republicans have not been willing to come to the table with the realization that any solution will take bipartisan support both in their chamber and the legislature.”
Spokespeople for Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) and Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana)  did not respond to requests for comment.
Firstly, there’s no consensus on how much the state should spend in total this year. In February, Shapiro proposed a $51.5 billion budget,  about $4.5 billion more than it was projected to take in.
Senate Republicans rejected the number, advocating for a balanced budget that wouldn’t dip into the commonwealth’s roughly $3 billion surplus or $7 billion rainy day funds. They also rejected a budget that passed the House in July that would have cut nearly $1 billion from Shapiro’s proposal.
In August, Senate Republicans passed what they described as a temporary budget, keeping spending largely the same as last year. The move, they said, would allow funding to flow to schools and counties, buying time for lawmakers to settle their differences. Democrats in the House rejected the move, advocating for a comprehensively negotiated budget instead of a stopgap.
Then, there are the disagreements over how much to spend and what policies should change.

“I’m frustrated that they haven’t done what they are, frankly, supposed to do. It’s their one job to put a budget on my desk,” Shapiro said at a press conference Thursday.
He put the onus on Senate Republicans, who he said have failed to meaningfully compromise and convened for too few session days, given the stakes of the fight.
In a statement released earlier this month, Pittman, the Senate Majority Leader, said the transit deal has sped negotiations up. But he added, “while I am encouraged by the meaningful work at the negotiating table, currently there is no global agreement on a budget deal, as several fiscal and policy issues remain outstanding. Reaching consensus swiftly would prevent negative impacts of a budget impasse being shouldered by counties, school districts, hospitals and all those who rely on state government services.”
With mass transit off the table, what else is being discussed?
One budget fight that has been resolved — at least temporarily — is the one over mass transit. 
It’s been 12 years since lawmakers passed a comprehensive solution for funding it with state dollars. But in the time since, costs have increased and the state’s transit agencies have warned they need a new source of revenue or will have to implement service cuts and fare hikes.
For Democrats, it was a top priority, and they advocated for a plan proposed by Shapiro that would have sent an additional 1.75% of the state’s sales tax revenue to the commonwealth’s transit authorities. 
Taking no action could impact transit systems across the commonwealth that serve urban, rural and suburban parts of the state with trains, buses and Shared Ride services.
Republicans, however, did not want to increase state funding for the programs they saw as primarily benefitting urban, Democratic-dominated parts of the state. Instead, they pushed to redirect dollars from a mass transit capital projects fund that is intended for things like replacing old trolleys and buses or renovating platforms.
In August, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), the state’s largest transit authority with roughly 800,000 riders a day, announced it would be implementing service cuts and fair raises, barring a plan from legislatures to increase their share of state funding.
However, a judge ruled that the cuts to train and bus lines disproportionately impacted minority and low-income communities, and blocked them. 
Following the ruling, Democrats caved, and lawmakers passed a bill to redirect the capital projects funding to the state’s largest transit authorities, SEPTA and Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT). The move bought about two years of runway for the legislature to find a permanent solution before the kinds of service cuts the agencies warned about would have to be implemented.
But, as Spotlight PA reported, the solution leaves the state’s smaller transit authorities, which serve primarily rural and suburban areas, without new state funding. Many are considering fare hikes and service cuts.
The impacts could be felt most by those who rely on state-funded Shared Ride programs, which are particularly important to seniors and disabled people in rural areas. The programs are run by transit authorities across the commonwealth, and operate on a deficit.

Rementer, the House Democratic spokesperson, said in a statement, “House Democrats have been clear that any long-term mass transit solution must include new, recurring, and reliable funding to fully fund transit in the commonwealth … We are in this predicament, which will have to be addressed in two years, only because Senate Republicans failed to come to the table with a real solution.”
Republicans have argued that the Public Transit Trust Fund, where the money was taken from, was over-funded, with hundreds of millions that had yet to be earmarked for projects. The solution, they’ve argued, will keep trains and buses running and give transit authorities time to address issues like crime and fare evasion while the legislature debates how best to increase their funding.
Yet even with one of the largest sources of disagreement effectively off the table, a state budget has yet to emerge.
In a press conference Thursday, Shapiro said the Senate and the House “have narrowed the differences,” but, at this point, it’s a familiar refrain.
Other major issues include how to fund public schools. Democrats are seeking more than $500 million additional dollars to be distributed through the adequacy formula that was developed last year.
The formula was a response to a Commonwealth Court ruling that found the previous funding formula was unconstitutionally inadequate, with too large a gap between the state’s richest and poorest schools.
For Democrats, the solution is a gradual ramp-up of funding disbursed though a formula that takes into account factors like poverty levels in a school district and the number of students learning English as a second language.
But Republicans have taken issue with the formula and the amount of state spending directed through it. Some have advocated for a new formula that would ultimately see the state spend less on education.
As for the  policy debates, lawmakers are discussing whether to tax so-called skill games or legalize cannabis, how to reform cyber charter school funding, how much to fund Medicaid following federal cuts to the program, whether to increase the minimum wage, and what the legislature should do to incentivize energy production.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pennsylvania-state-capitol-augus-2025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 14:58:41.545302

We’ve landed back in the late 1980s-early 1990s, an era bookended by two pieces of legislation that led to mass incarceration and huge racial disparities in sentencing: the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the 1994 crime bill.

Republican and Democratic states are taking different approaches to using their National Guards to help the Trump administration. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)The rhetoric over crime feels as if we’re strapped in a DeLorean and hurtling back to a dangerous future.
We’ve landed back in the late 1980s-early 1990s, an era bookended by two pieces of legislation that led to mass incarceration and huge racial disparities in sentencing: the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the 1994 crime bill. Fear of “superpredators” — later debunked as myth — drove policies to treat juveniles as irredeemable adult criminals. Instead of Willie Horton, now there’s Decarlos Brown Jr.
Fear, denial, and division lead us to cast blame and grasp for outdated solutions. Some voices on the left minimize legitimate concerns over urban violence. On the right, outrage over horrific crimes — such as the tragic, senseless killings of Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte and Laken Riley in Georgia — is used to justify mass arrests and deportations, harsher sentences, and threats of more National Guard deployments in cities. Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department has terminated hundreds of grants for violence prevention programs.
This shouldn’t be a partisan debate. After all, the aforementioned federal bills were bipartisan, and the 1994 crime bill was sponsored by Sen. Joe Biden. In his first administration, President Donald Trump signed the First Step Act, which released thousands of inmates from federal prisons and provided programs to reduce recidivism.
The recent rhetoric threatens proven anti-crime programs, argues David Kennedy, a professor of criminal justice at John Jay College, in a New York Times essay on Sept. 10, titled “What Both the Left and the Right Get Wrong About Violent Crime.”
Kennedy points to research showing that violence-intervention strategies have led to falling crime rates in Oakland, Baltimore, and other metros, but also smaller cities like Davenport. Five years ago, the Iowa city’s violent crime rate was twice the national average. With a change in police strategies, shootings are down 46% and violent crime has fallen 24%.
“The good news is that we have proven ways to reduce violent crime, and policymakers around the country are embracing them,” Kennedy writes. “The bad news is that this politicized back-and-forth is taking us away from what we know works.”
What works is recognizing that in cities big and small alike, a tiny group of people in a few neighborhoods is responsible for most of the shootings and other violence. Research in Boston, Oakland, and New Orleans, for example, shows that less than 1% of the population is part of a social network that account for more than half of the homicides, according to Thomas Abt’s 2019 book, “Bleeding Out.”
Abt argues that the first step in reducing urban poverty and improving people’s lives is to staunch the bleeding in these troubled areas. No amount of investment in education, health care, or economic development will turn around a neighborhood beset by violence. “The surest path to prosperity begins with peace,” he writes.
Abt and Kennedy lay out similar approaches: Communities must target those groups and neighborhoods with resources, balancing enforcement, prevention, and treatment. That means a strong police force that gathers intelligence on gang activity, identifies hot spots, and distinguishes between those causing the violence vs. those at risk of joining the shooting or being shot.
But it also requires an army of social workers, gang outreach specialists, ministers, coaches, business owners, grandparents, and others to reach out to “would-be shooters” and offer them alternatives and opportunities. “Like law enforcement, they must work in shifts in order to be available at all hours, they must have adequate communication and transportation that allow them to respond quickly, and they must have access to resources instantly in order to remedy a dangerous situation,” Abt writes.
Yes, it takes a village, and lots of resources.
This strategy led to youth homicides falling by almost two-thirds in Boston during the late 1990s, Kennedy writes.
What doesn’t work is indiscriminate, broad policing that sweeps up all youth in a high-crime community, instead of focusing on dangerous offenders.
“Overenforcement might lead to more arrests and more time in jail and prison, but it will not necessarily result in less violence. In fact, recklessly aggressive policing and prosecution may actually increase violence,” Abt writes, citing research on aggressive drug enforcement.
“Bleeding Out” helped inspire Safe & Thriving Youth: Central Iowa’s Youth Violence Reduction Plan, a initiative by the United Way of Central Iowa. The coalition of law enforcement, social-service providers, and civic leaders in Des Moines has launched a comprehensive strategy to reduce youth violence, support at-risk individuals, and create a safer community.
Such strategies must be led, organized, and adapted on the local level. However, federal and state funding – as well as private-sector support – is necessary to provide the resources needed.
The dividends will spread throughout a city, creating a safer, more just, fair, and prosperous community.
Or we can travel backward, falling back on fear and policies that are as effective as a flaky flux capacitor.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said he is researching what legal options the state might have against South Dakota, which he said is impeding interstate commerce by banning the use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipeline projects. 
Wrigley called the legislation signed into law in March a “hostile act” on a radio talk show this week. 
South Dakota leaders on Friday defended the law that takes away the ability of carbon pipeline developers such as Summit Carbon Solutions to use eminent domain. Eminent domain is a legal procedure to force landowners to provide property easements for projects that benefit the general public. 
Summit’s goal is to build a network of pipelines in five states to capture carbon emissions from ethanol plants and send it to North Dakota for permanent underground storage. The main trunk of the pipeline would run through South Dakota, where Summit has so far been unable to secure a state permit and has met significant resistance from landowners. 
Summit petitions Iowa regulators to remove Dakotas requirement from pipeline permit

North Dakota has approved permits for the pipeline route and the underground sequestration. 
South Dakota state Rep. Jon Hansen, the speaker of the House and a candidate for governor, sponsored the bill that Wrigley opposes. Hansen responded to Wrigley on Facebook: 
“It appears the carbon pipeline lobbyists have found their latest puppet — and now North Dakota taxpayers might be being forced to bankroll a lawsuit against their own neighbors in South Dakota, all to help a private carbon pipeline company,” Hansen wrote. 
“Unlike you, we are standing on the side of our people — defending THE PEOPLE’s constitutional right to private property over an out-of-state company’s desire to take what’s not theirs,” Hansen continued. 
South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden’s office responded to questions about Wrigley’s comments by pointing to the letter the governor sent legislators in March explaining his decision to sign the bill. 
In the letter, Rhoden emphasized his commitment to property rights.
Wrigley did not name Summit in his comments to radio host Scott Hennen on WZFG, The Flag, based in Fargo, but said North Dakota is considering suing South Dakota over its law. 
“Because at the end of the day, the United States has a commerce clause in our federal Constitution, because to have a nation, you have to have commerce between and around and across states,” Wrigley said. 
The attorney general’s spokesperson said Wrigley was out of the office Friday.

Wrigley, as part of the North Dakota Industrial Commission, voted to approve Summit’s sequestration plan. 
North Dakota and South Dakota politics are both dominated by the Republican Party. 
Rhoden, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley and Hansen are all Republicans. 
Wrigley and North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong are Republicans, who also hold a super majority in the Legislature. 
But while Republican opponents of eminent domain gained influence in the South Dakota Legislature, Republican-led bills to curb the use of eminent domain failed in this year’s North Dakota legislative session.  
Wrigley said he also would be reaching out to South Dakota leaders on the eminent domain law, along with Armstrong.  
“I know that he’s going to be a great force and lead around these issues as well,” Wrigley said. 
Jackley provided a statement Friday: “I will defend the laws and People of South Dakota, it’s as simple as that. The Legislature voted for the private property rights by wide margins, and Gov. Rhoden signed it into law. The People of South Dakota voted decisively on this issue, and I will support them.”
In addition to North Dakota, Summit has obtained pipeline route permits in Iowa and for a small section of Minnesota. Nebraska has no agency that deals with carbon pipelines. 
The project would take advantage of federal tax credits for carbon capture. Summit says the project will benefit ethanol producers and the farmers who supply the ethanol plants with corn.

WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware’s fight against Alzheimer’s disease is entering a critical phase. New data show not only a rising number of residents living with Alzheimer’s, but a cascade of economic, workforce, and health system impacts that are already straining families, employers, and state budgets.
“This is not just a health issue—it’s a statewide infrastructure issue,” said Linda Barba, Senior Manager, Marketing and Communications for the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter, in an interview with Delaware LIVE. “As more Delawareans are diagnosed, every part of the care network—from hospitals to employers to family caregivers—feels the pressure.”
A Rapid Rise in Cases
According to the Alzheimer’s Association’s 2025 Facts and Figures report, approximately 23,000 Delaware residents over age 65 are living with Alzheimer’s, up from 22,300 in 2023. From 2000 to 2022, Alzheimer’s-related deaths in Delaware increased by nearly 300 percent, reflecting both a larger senior population and improved detection.
“Age is the greatest known risk factor, and Delaware’s senior population is growing faster than the national average,” Barba said. “That combination means we are seeing more diagnoses, more hospitalizations, and more families needing support.”
Economic and Workforce Strain
The ripple effects extend well beyond the bedside.


Medicaid Pressure: Alzheimer’s drives higher long-term care use and repeat hospitalizations, increasing costs for Delaware’s Medicaid program, which already allocates a large share to aged and disabled services.


Direct Care Shortages: Memory care units, home health agencies, and adult day programs face chronic staffing gaps—particularly in Sussex and Kent counties—delaying hospital discharges and lengthening waitlists.


Employer Impact: As spouses and adult children cut work hours or leave jobs to provide care, Delaware’s midsize employers—especially in health care, education, and state government—see higher absenteeism and turnover.


Hidden Costs: Families frequently spend down savings on respite care, transportation, and home modifications to qualify for Medicaid coverage.


“This is a disease that doesn’t just affect people living with the disease,” Barba said. “It affects the entire economic ecosystem of the state.”
Pressure on Health and Long-Term Care Systems
Hospitals, primary care practices, and long-term care facilities are struggling to keep pace.


Hospital Throughput: ChristianaCare, Bayhealth, and Beebe report longer inpatient stays for people living with dementia due to delirium risks and complex discharge planning.


Primary Care Load: Family doctors are conducting more cognitive screenings and coordinating care without enough dementia-trained navigators, stretching appointment capacity in New Castle and fast-growing Sussex.


Memory Care Access: Demand for secured memory care beds and adult day slots outpaces supply, particularly in rural areas, where long drives and few programs intensify caregiver burnout.


Determining the right care options and resources for a loved one is often one of the most emotionally taxing experiences families face. Lynn Paxson, president of Oasis Senior Advisors Delaware and Eastern Shore, noted that the shortage of a wide-ranging assortment of assisted living and memory care options makes the search increasingly difficult.

“Families frequently reach out in crisis, only to discover that the type of options they want are not available,” Paxson explained. “Even before they call us, many caregivers are already stretched to the breaking point. And when there is availability, long waitlists for specific needs and preferences can be long and costs daunting.”



Behavioral Health Overlap: Shortages in geriatric psychiatry and mobile crisis teams lead to more 911 calls and emergency department boarding when behavioral issues escalate.


Caregiver and Community Impact
For Delaware families, the burden is deeply personal.
“Alzheimer’s care can last eight to eleven years on average,” Barba said. “That’s years of round-the-clock responsibility that takes a toll on physical health, finances, and mental well-being.
Early-stage support can be just as overwhelming. Lori Smith, director of We Care at Milford Wellness Village, said families often struggle simply to figure out where to begin.

“When a parent first starts showing signs of memory loss, it can feel like there’s no clear map,” Smith said. “Families are suddenly faced with a maze of programs, medical providers, and financial considerations. Our role is to help them sort through those options—whether it’s adult day programs, home care, or medical evaluations—so they can make informed choices before the situation becomes a crisis.”

Finding affordable in-home care presents another major hurdle. Patrick Gray, director of Griswold Care, said many Delaware families want to keep loved ones at home but face rising costs and limited staffing.

“The demand for in-home care is exploding, but affordability remains a serious barrier,” Gray said. “Families can be forced to patch together part-time aides or reduce hours because of cost. The hopeful side is that new technology—like remote monitoring, medication reminders, and fall detection—can help stretch care budgets and give families peace of mind when they can’t be there in person.”

Caregivers in Delaware report higher rates of depression and chronic stress, and many struggle to navigate a patchwork of services such as state aging programs, veterans’ benefits, legal planning, and respite care. Black and Latino families in Wilmington, Dover, and Georgetown face later diagnoses and fewer culturally matched services, which can worsen disease severity by the time treatment begins.
Public Safety and Social Services
The disease’s reach extends into public safety and the courts:


Wandering and Silver Alerts are increasing, requiring coordinated responses from state police and local EMS.


Adult Protective Services sees more cases of self-neglect and caregiver burnout leading to emergency placements.


Courts and Guardianship are handling more contested powers of attorney and probate cases as financial capacity declines.


County-by-County Pressures


New Castle County: Higher hospital volume and more urban safety calls, with concentrated needs in Wilmington and aging suburbs like Hockessin, Pike Creek, and Newark.


Kent County: Gaps in specialty care and transportation hurdles to Dover and Smyrna drive heavier reliance on Medicaid long-term services.


Sussex County: Rapid in-migration of retirees is driving the fastest growth in dementia prevalence, outpacing workforce and memory-care capacity from Lewes to Millsboro.


Pathways to Relief
Barba outlined several priorities to ease the burden:


Early Detection at Scale: Normalizing cognitive screening in primary care and pharmacies, with fast-track referrals and navigators.


Caregiver Infrastructure: Expanding respite vouchers, adult day programs, and paid family leave supports.


Workforce Pipelines: Scholarships and career ladders for certified nursing assistants and home health aides, plus mandatory dementia training for frontline staff.


Mobile Supports: Dementia-capable crisis teams, in-home therapy, and technology for wandering prevention and medication management.


Equity and Access: Culturally tailored outreach in Wilmington, Dover, and Sussex’s multilingual communities.


Data-Driven Planning: Updating and funding the state Alzheimer’s plan with county-level targets for beds, respite hours, and workforce growth.


Help for Families
Despite the daunting statistics, Barba emphasized that resources are available. The Alzheimer’s Association 24/7 Helpline (800-272-3900) offers confidential support, crisis assistance, and referrals in more than 200 languages. Support groups, educational courses, and the My ALZ Journey mobile app provide practical guidance for caregivers navigating the disease.
“No one should have to face Alzheimer’s alone,” Barba said. “But Delaware must also face the reality that this is a growing crisis requiring coordinated action from every sector of our community.”

How do I register to vote?
Am I registered to vote?
You can check the secretary of state’s website: You’ll need to enter your name, date of birth and either your California driver license, identification card number or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you don’t have those available, contact your county elections office or the secretary of state via email or phone at (800) 345-8683.If you’ve changed your name since the last time you voted, or if you moved and didn’t notify the Department of Motor Vehicles or U.S. Postal Service, you may have to register again. If you haven’t voted in several consecutive general elections, your registration may have been canceled.
How do I register?
You can do so online here. You’ll need the same information as above.
If the DMV has your signature on file, you’ll be able to complete the process online. If not, you’ll need to print, sign and mail your completed application to your county elections office. You can also pick up a paper application at elections offices, any DMV office and at many post offices, public libraries and government offices. You’ll be contacted when your application is approved, or if you need to provide more information.
What happens if I miss the voter registration deadline?
The last day to register online for the general election is Oct. 20. If you are registering or re-registering less than 15 days before Nov. 4, you must complete same-day voter registration and request your ballot in person at your county elections office or polling location. 
How do I change my political party if I’m already registered?
You’ll need to re-register to vote.
 
 


What if I need help with voting?
What if I need voter information in a language other than English?
The secretary of state’s office has voter instructions in the following languages: Spanish, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, Vietnamese. Your county elections office may offer additional languages. 
When will I receive my voter guide?
The statewide voter information guide is available online and will be mailed to voters in September.
What am I voting on?
Gov. Gavin Newsom called a special election to vote on Proposition 50, his measure to gerrymander California congressional districts to favor Democrats in the 2026 midterm election. It’s intended to offset a gerrymander in Texas that Republican President Donald Trump called for to boost the GOP next year’s election.
Can I leave work to vote?
Yes. California requires time off for voting if employees don’t have enough time outside work hours. You can take as much time as you need, but employers are only required to pay for a maximum of two hours.
Employers may require advance notice. The time off must be at the beginning or the end of your shift. Employers are required to post a notice about this 10 days before a statewide election.
How can I track my ballot?
Go online then select “My Voter Status” to check if your vote was counted and if not, what the issue was.

What if I have special circumstances?
What should I do if I marked my ballot wrong, or otherwise messed it up?
If you haven’t turned it in yet, you can exchange your mail ballot for a new one at an elections office, ask an election official at the polling place for a new ballot, or vote using a provisional ballot. If you have mailed or turned in your ballot, there’s no way to fix it. Contact your county elections office for a new ballot. 
What if the signature on my ballot doesn’t match the one on file?
County election officials check the signatures on the return envelope against signatures on your voter registration card to make sure no one tries to improperly cast your ballot. It still remains confidential; the ballot is separated from the envelope before it is counted.
Voters with ballots with missing signatures or ones that don’t match are notified and given an opportunity to correct the problem before the election is certified.
What happens if I don’t receive my ballot?
Contact your county elections office. 
Help! I dropped off my ballot to a drop box in the wrong county.
Don’t worry – the county will pass it on to the correct elections office. 
I forgot to detach the stub from my ballot. Can I open the sealed envelope and reseal it myself?
You can, but the secretary of state’s office recommends contacting your local county elections office. They’ll ultimately be processing your ballot and they can offer the best guidance on whether you should reopen it or just leave the stub attached.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091825-2025-VG-FAQ-GH-CM-scaled.png?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 14:00:15.869437
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-19 17:26:57+00:00,CT Mirror,U.S. Justice Dept. pushes voter fraud complaints from CT group,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/ct-doj-voter-fraud-complaints/,A CT nonprofit that has filed dozens of unsubstantiated voter fraud allegations now has a powerful new ally: the U.S. Department of Justice.,"Fight Voter Fraud Inc., a nonprofit group based in Middletown, has filed dozens of unsubstantiated allegations with Connecticut officials in recent years claiming that thousands of people voted illegally in the state, forcing investigators to spend hours investigating and debunking the group’s claims.
But the group now has a powerful new ally in pushing its allegations about voter fraud: the U.S. Department of Justice.
In August, a high-ranking official from the DOJ forwarded information compiled by Fight Voter Fraud Inc. to the Connecticut State Elections Enforcement Commission and demanded that the agency look into the group’s allegations that roughly 14 people have voted more than once in recent elections. 
The DOJ communications were sent to SEEC by Mac Warner, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the DOJ’s civil rights division.
Warner, who previously served as West Virginia’s Secretary of State from 2017 to 2025, has publicly claimed multiple times that the 2020 Presidential election was stolen from President Donald Trump due to actions by the FBI and CIA.
Warner’s communication with the SEEC sets up a unique situation, in which the DOJ is placing its weight behind allegations compiled by an organization that has been criticized in the past for repeatedly advancing unfounded claims based on its misinterpretation of voter registration information and other data.
Stephanie Thomas, Connecticut’s Democratic Secretary of the State, said this week that it was unnecessary for the DOJ to be forwarding allegations of voter fraud to the SEEC. 
“Connecticut already has a system to investigate credible claims through our State Elections Enforcement Commission,” Thomas said in a statement. “Involving the U.S. Department of Justice in these preliminary allegations risks blurring the lines of that process.” 
“Allegations are not evidence, and our voters deserve better,” Thomas added. 
Linda Szynkowicz, the founder and CEO of Fight Voter Fraud Inc., did not respond to a phone call for this story.
And officials with the U.S. Department of Justice did not address how Warner came into possession of the complaints compiled by Fight Voter Fraud Inc.

A DOJ spokesperson also did not answer questions about whether federal officials officially independently investigated the allegations contained in the complaints prior to forwarding them to SEEC, or whether the federal government is asking other states to investigate similar claims of voter fraud from outside groups.
“The Justice Department is committed to upholding the integrity of our electoral system and will continue to prioritize efforts to ensure all elections remain free, fair, and transparent,” said Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the DOJ. 
Clare Kindall, SEEC’s interim director, confirmed her agency received two memos from the DOJ in recent months requesting that state officials investigate allegations produced by Fight Voter Fraud Inc. 
In the first case, Kindall said SEEC did not act on the communication because Fight Voter Fraud Inc. had previously filed the exact same allegations with the agency, and SEEC staff were already investigating the claims that 4,897 people may have voted more than once.
But the second memo, which was sent last month and included claims that another 14 people voted twice in recent elections, prompted SEEC to open a formal investigation this week.
“We take every allegation seriously, and we are handling this complaint within the normal course of business as we do with any other complaint,” said Kindall, who previously served as Connecticut’s Solicitor General. 
“We traditionally have a very good working relationship with DOJ and all law enforcement,” she added. 
The relationship between SEEC and the Fight Voter Fraud Inc. has been more fraught, however. 
Following the 2020 presidential election, Szynkowicz sent SEEC more than 50 complaints alleging thousands of incarcerated people, unregistered adults and underaged teens voted illegally in Connecticut during the election between Trump and Joe Biden.
Those complaints required SEEC staff to devote a large amount of time looking into each allegation. Once those investigations were complete, SEEC took the uncharacteristic step of admonishing the group and its founder for wasting the agency’s time and resources.
“The Commission notes that, while significant commission resources were required to process and definitively disprove the allegations contained in these complaints, complainant could have avoided the waste of these resources if she had ascertained the requirements of the law and the meaning of the data she produced as evidence,” SEEC members wrote in one of the orders. 
“The commission would strongly encourage those who hold themselves out as authorities on election law investigations to educate themselves on both the facts and law of the complaints they file with the Commission to avoid the needless waste of the limited investigatory resources of the Commission,” SEEC added. 
Even after that reprimand, however, additional complaints from Fight Voter Fraud Inc. have flooded into the SEEC, and Szynkowicz has continued to earn nearly $200,000 per year leading the organization, according to IRS records.
The newest complaints from Fight Voter Fraud Inc. rely primarily on data showing that people are registered to vote in two locations, and the group uses that information to claim many of them voted twice.
But as the SEEC pointed out in past cases, people who move can be registered in two locations without casting more than one ballot during an election.
Rep. Matt Blumenthal, who leads the state legislature’s Government Administration and Elections Committee, said he found it odd that the DOJ was using its power and credibility to advance allegations from a group that has frequently made baseless claims about voter fraud. 
“Anyone can submit a complaint or information which can predicate an investigation by the SEEC,” Blumenthal said. “But it is unorthodox that the U.S. Department of Justice would be submitting information.”
Blumenthal pointed out that the DOJ has the authority to charge people for double voting if they believe it occurred, and he questioned why the federal government was forwarding such allegations on to a state agency. 
“The DOJ has immense investigatory powers and resources,” Blumenthal said. “If they had a reasonable basis for thinking these allegations were true, they would have the ability to investigate and prosecute it themselves.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEEC-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 14:00:15.869437

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s chief financial officer demanded Friday that social media companies be held accountable for creating disappearing messages that handicap child sex trafficking investigations.
Blaise Ingoglia, a Spring Hill Republican and former state senator, accused social media platforms of “destroying evidence” of messages between groomers and minors by installing instant vanishing features across platforms. His comments came Friday, amid a broader legal battle waged by Florida officials trying to impose age restrictions on social media companies.
“A lot of these tech companies are in this state of de facto protecting these predators,” Ingoglia said during a Winter Haven press conference, speaking alongside Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, adding that a case that should be a “slam dunk” for law enforcement is stopped by vanishing messages.
“These social media companies need to be held accountable for destroying vital evidence that law enforcement needs to put these predators in prison,” he told The Florida Phoenix in a phone call later. “It’s severely hindering and handicapping their efforts.”
Ingoglia, appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis as CFO in July, had sponsored a bill during the 2025 session that would have required social media companies to decrypt messages if subpoenaed by a court, and would have prohibited minors from having access to disappearing messages. The measure failed, despite passing the Senate.
This isn’t Florida’s only venture into targeting the social media world. The predominantly GOP-led Legislature in 2024 passed a law banning social media companies from allowing children under 15 years old to create accounts, sparking a massive legal battle between state officials and two trade associations representing social media giants. The law was blocked by an appellate court over the summer, but the case remains pending.
Earlier this year, Uthmeier filed a lawsuit against Snapchat, a social media platform allowing users to send each other photos and messages that can vanish instantly after viewing. He heralded the April case as just the beginning of his continued crackdown on social media platforms, building off of a separate investigation into the gaming platform Roblox.
Other platforms that allow for encrypted messages include Instagram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal.
As a lawmaker, Ingoglia also sponsored a new law funding a grant for law enforcement to ramp up online sting operations to capture and imprison child predators. During Friday’s press conference, which announced 246 arrests of human traffickers, child predators, and prostitutes in just seven days, Ingoglia added that parents need to become aware of the “depravity” of online predators.
“You have no idea of the depravity that is waiting to take advantage, take hold of them, abuse them, and turn their lives upside down,” he said. “Social media companies should stop the encryption of any message that has a minor account so law enforcement can have the proof they need to put these scumbags away for life.”

Laura Kelly and Department for Children and Families secretary Laura Howard to push them to release data to the federal government. Judge Teresa Watson will make a decision by Sept. 29 on whether to dismiss the case. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A lawsuit filed by Attorney General Kris Kobach to force Kansas leaders to turn over data requested by the federal government heated up this week with sharply worded filings.
Kobach sued Gov. Laura Kelly and Department for Children and Family secretary Laura Howard on Sept. 9, demanding they turn over personal information of more than 700,000 Kansans who applied for or received food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Kobach announced the lawsuit in a news conference the day before.
In a motion to dismiss filed Monday, Kelly and Howard’s attorneys called the action “a sad political stunt.”
“Respondents are following the law, and this case is a sad political stunt by the Attorney General as evidenced by the fact that he chose to litigate via press conference before filing this case or even bothering to confer with Respondents, who would have told him: do not panic, Kansas has a plan to preserve the funding of the State’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, while ensuring the privacy of approximately seven hundred thirty thousand individuals, consistent with data privacy obligations under state and federal law,” the motion said. 
On Thursday, Kobach pushed back in his response: “Respondents have chosen to defy Kansas and federal law and risk millions of dollars that ultimately help the most vulnerable Kansans. It appears that their ‘plan’ is to do nothing and hope that no one will require them to follow the plain text of the law. Their route is neither tenable nor lawful.”
After a hearing on Thursday, Shawnee County District Judge Teresa Watson said she would make a decision on Sept. 29 regarding the motion to dismiss.
Kelly and Howard’s 191-page motion to dismiss the case reiterates explanations Howard has given that turning over the data may violate privacy rights of Kansans and explained how they are working to resolve the situation.
They pointed to a California lawsuit in which multiple states contend the U.S. Department of Agriculture doesn’t have the right to the requested SNAP data.
On Thursday, the judge in the national case issued a temporary restraining order stopping the USDA from acting on the warning letters it has sent to states that said SNAP funding will be lost.
The state received a letter in August from former Kansas Rep. Patrick Penn, who is now the USDA deputy under secretary of Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, warned that Kansas could lose federal funding for SNAP administrative expenses if it did not submit the data.
Howard has said Kansas officials are concerned about releasing the data and the liability they could face if the California-led lawsuit determines the USDA should not receive the data. 
Kobach’s filings in the case against Howard and Kelly said Kansas statutes require the state comply with the federal government’s request and that their “brazen noncompliance” establishes their guilt.
“Federal punishment aside, Respondents are state officers refusing to follow clear and direct commands within state law, so this mandamus action is ripe,” the Kobach filing said. “Moreover, the State possesses standing to bring its suit, which is anchored in state law that requires Respondents to cooperate with the federal government. Federal law does not prevent the State from seeking injunctive relief.”
In their filing to dismiss the action, Kelly and Howard said the data cannot be “meaningfully” recalled once it is submitted.
“The damage to the privacy and the loss of trust would be immeasurable,” their filing said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6170141-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-19 14:00:15.869437

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate) The Arkansas Education Department released public school ratings Friday that were calculated using a new accountability formula for the first time. 
The goal of the revised formula, which still assigns schools a rating of A-F, is “to provide a clearer and more meaningful picture” of student achievement, year-to-year growth and postsecondary readiness, according to a news release. 
Education officials created the new formula to go along with the new state test, the Arkansas Teaching, Learning & Assessment System (ATLAS), which replaced the discontinued ACT Aspire and was first administered to students in spring 2024. The new accountability formula was developed with input from educators and community members, including nearly 400 who participated in listening sessions during the summer of 2023, according to ADE.
Arkansas school rating system should consider additional factors, superintendents say

In a call with reporters Friday morning, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said some of the feedback he received about the previous formula was that many superintendents didn’t have confidence that the letter grades reflected the learning happening in the schools. 
“We wanted to make sure that [the new accountability system] was focused on achievement, it was focused on growth, and we’re making sure we prioritize students that need the most support and it was in a manner that was clear and concise and easy to understand,” Oliva said. 
Arkansas has seen several educational changes as a result of the LEARNS Act, a 2023 law backed by the governor that overhauled the state’s K-12 education system. Among other things, the law raised the state’s minimum teacher salary to $50,000 and created a school voucher program. 
“LEARNS is all about improving the way we educate kids in Arkansas, and our new letter grade formula, alongside the new ATLAS exam, allows us to do that with a better, more full picture of where each of our students and schools stand,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in the news release.
Rep. Keith Brooks, a Little Rock Republican who co-sponsored the LEARNS Act, backed another law during the 2025 legislative session that required ADE to establish a new accountability system for public schools to “align with the educational priorities” of the LEARNS Act. 
The new law required ADE to issue grades under the new system for the 2024-2025 academic year. If schools did not maintain or improve their letter grade under the new system, the law allows them to request a review by the education department’s Division of Public School Accountability. 
For the 2023-2024 school year, ADE provided districts with simulated grades based on the first administration of the ATLAS test so officials could better understand the new formula before official grades were issued, according to the news release. 
Letter grades released Friday for the 2024-2025 academic year mark the first time schools have been officially ranked under the new system. Slightly more than one-third of schools received a “C.” Nearly 12% received an “A” and 12.6% received an “F.”
When the previous formula was last used during the 2022-2023 academic year, more than 40% of schools received a “C.” Roughly 7.7% received an “A” and another 7.6% received an “F.”

Although the formulas differ, Oliva said schools that received an “A” under either system likely had high-quality learning and programming, while “F”-rated schools probably had broken systems. The confusion with the previous system was with the middle rankings because “those confidence levels were very narrow,” he said.
“This is a more clear, concise process now to say we’re more confident that we feel like this is a better reflection of learning that’s happening in schools,” Oliva said. 
Under the updated formula, the highest score a school can earn is 900, and one-third of each school’s rating is based on the students’ performance in English language arts, math and science on the ATLAS exam, according to ADE. 
Two-thirds of elementary and middle school ratings and more than one-third of high school ratings are based on the extent to which students are meeting their individualized growth targets each year. High school scores will also measure whether students are graduating on time and demonstrating postsecondary readiness. 
Arkansas’ school accountability system transitioned from a 1-5 scale to a letter grade scale about a decade ago with the passage of a 2013 law that aimed to clarify the rating system for parents. The previous formula used for calculating the letter grades was based on a 300-point system and developed by the University of Arkansas’ Office of Innovation for Education in consultation with ADE and educational leaders, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. 
The law creating the A-F scale went into effect in the 2014-2015 school year. Then in 2017, Act 930 and Act 744 aligned the state’s accountability systems with federal requirements and permitted the use of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) School Index score as the universal score for accountability.
Oliva said education officials will use the letter grades to identify state resources like literacy coaches.
“We want to make sure the schools that aren’t getting learning gains and achievement levels are getting the right layers of support … how do we make sure we’re moving the needle forward because ultimately our goal is to eliminate failure,” he said.
A school’s letter grade affected students’ eligibility for the Educational Freedom Account program during the first two years of the school voucher program. Students enrolled in an “F”-rated school were eligible to participate in the 2023-2024 academic year. Eligibility expanded to students enrolled in a “D”-rated school for the 2024-2025 academic year. The EFA program opened to all Arkansas students this fall and more than 46,600 students had been approved to participate as of last week.
The new school ratings were released to superintendents Thursday, according to ADE officials. They will be available to the public on ADE’s website Friday afternoon and on the MySchoolInfo dashboard in October.

I’ve seen firsthand how they help prevent disease and reduce hospitalizations.,"Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

I was born and raised in Meridian, Mississippi just four minutes from the Walgreens where I now work as a pharmacist. Some might say my roots in this community run deep.
My family owned a group of independent pharmacies in the area for years, and when they were ready to exit the profession, Walgreens gave me the opportunity to continue doing what I’ve always known: caring for my community through pharmacy.
Today, I serve as a district immunization lead, which means I often lead local vaccine clinics and outreach efforts across the region. It’s a role that allows me to expand my impact beyond the pharmacy counter and bring care directly to the communities that need it most.

A big reason I’m so passionate about preventive care is because I’ve seen firsthand how vaccines can make a difference and how the absence of one can lead to regret.
I recently counseled two patients who are twins about the importance of getting the shingles vaccine. One accepted my recommendation and got vaccinated. The other declined. About a month later, the patient who didn’t get the vaccine came into the pharmacy with shingles.
The patient immediately expressed regret and wished they had gotten the shot. I walked them through when they’d be eligible to receive it, and they’re now planning to get vaccinated. That experience reminded me why I chose this profession — to help people make informed decisions that protect their health. 
Mississippi has long struggled with low vaccination rates, and this year, I’m especially concerned.
Misinformation is making it harder for people to trust the principles of how vaccines protect us. I hear it every day: “I’ve never had the flu, so I don’t need the shot.”
But the truth is, flu vaccines aren’t just about individual protection. They’re about keeping our hospitals from being overwhelmed, reducing treatment costs and protecting our most vulnerable neighbors, including children, seniors and those with chronic conditions.
At my store on the east side of Mississippi, we take care of a lot of patients who need vaccines. I’ve worked hard to build trust with my patients, and they rely on me to make sure they’re getting the right care.
That trust is something I don’t take lightly. We host onsite vaccine clinics and do everything we can to raise awareness about the importance of getting vaccinated – especially in more rural areas where hesitancy is higher.
The misconceptions around flu vaccines aren’t new, but they’ve been amplified in recent years. That’s why it’s more important than ever to have honest conversations with your pharmacist – someone who knows your health history, your concerns and your community.
Getting a flu shot is quick, easy and one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and those around you.
I trust vaccines. I’ve seen firsthand how they help prevent disease and reduce hospitalizations.
And I’ll continue doing everything I can to make sure my neighbors in Mississippi have access to the care they need — starting with a simple flu shot.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-19 16:38:45+00:00,CT Mirror,Hartford HealthCare offers $86M for 2 Prospect Medical CT hospitals,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/hartford-healthcare-ct-prospect-medical/,Hartford HealthCare’s offer for Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals will serve as the minimum bid in the bankruptcy auction.,"Hartford HealthCare, one of the two largest health systems in Connecticut, has offered $86.1 million to purchase Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals from Prospect Medical Holdings, the California-based operator that filed for bankruptcy protection in January. 
ECHN Holdings Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare, will serve as the “stalking horse bidder” for the two hospitals in the court-supervised sale auction, according to court documents. The “stalking horse” serves as the first bidder in a bankruptcy auction whose offer serves as the minimum bid. 
Other bidders may submit offers through Oct. 16. A sale hearing, where the bankruptcy court judge will approve the preferred offer, is scheduled for Oct. 24. 
Prospect Medical Holdings paid $105 million when it purchased the two hospitals in 2016. 
Tina Varona, a spokesperson for Hartford HealthCare, said in an emailed statement that the health system is “excited to explore this opportunity” and “uniquely qualified to transform healthcare for the better in these communities.”
“We have the capability to stabilize and expand the workforce at these hospitals, provide support to enhance quality and safety, and advance strategic investments in people, programs, technologies, facilities, and community partners,” Varona wrote. “Given Prospect’s restructuring proceedings, this is a complex process that will unfold over the coming weeks.”
Deborah Weymouth, president and CEO of Eastern Connecticut Health Network and Waterbury Health, called the bid an “important step” in the sale process.
“We are proud of the exceptional care we provide daily and equally excited about the promise of our future,” Weymouth wrote in an emailed statement on Friday. “Achieving this milestone demonstrates the value that we continue to contribute to our communities and brings us closer to starting a new chapter.”
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the governor has been focused on ensuring the facilities “transfer to new sustainable long-term operators that will benefit the communities they serve and their incredible staff.” The administration is “very encouraged that Hartford HealthCare has stepped up to help provide continuity of care in the region,” he added.
If Hartford HealthCare prevails in the sale auction, the deal will have to go through the state approval process, known as “certificate of need,” which is overseen by the Office of Health Strategy. OHS and the Lamont administration faced criticism over the time required to approve a failed $435 million deal signed in 2022 for Yale New Haven Health to acquire the three Prospect-owned hospitals.
During the most recent legislative session, lawmakers passed a measure that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy. Under the emergency certificate of need timeline, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete. 
The acquisition would further expand the footprint of one of Connecticut’s largest health systems.
Hartford HealthCare currently owns a total of seven hospitals across the state, the most of any health system in Connecticut, and earned roughly $6 billion in revenue in 2023. By comparison, Yale New Haven Health had higher revenue in 2023, $6.4 billion, but only owns four hospitals.
The bid announcement marks the latest ownership development, after months of silence, for Prospect’s three hospitals in Connecticut — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury Hospital
Earlier this week, the state-owned University of Connecticut Health Center announced that it would submit a bid to acquire Waterbury Hospital. The move is part of a broader strategy by Connecticut’s only public academic medical center to expand its footprint. UConn is also seeking to acquire Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals as part of that deal. 
[RELATED: CT in talks to buy Bristol, Day Kimball and Waterbury Hospitals]
“We are working with multiple parties that are interested in acquiring Waterbury HEALTH and we expect to advance a stalking horse bid on this portion of our Connecticut operations shortly,” Weymouth, the CEO, stated in emailed comments.
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, who works as a physician at Manchester Memorial and serves as the co-chair of the state legislature’s Public Health Committee, welcomed the announcement, calling it an opportunity to “reduce private equity’s presence in state healthcare.”
“This is incredibly welcome news for health care in the state of Connecticut. I fully endorse and encourage Hartford HealthCare’s bid to purchase these hospitals, which would preserve local community care in Manchester, Vernon and their surrounding towns and cities,” Anwar wrote in a statement released on Friday.
Vernon mayor Dan Champagne said Hartford HealthCare’s offer brings “new hope” to the community.
“For years we have been working hard to secure Rockville Hospital’s future and this is a major step towards that,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-19 16:34:23+00:00,CT Mirror,BOEM seeks revocation of SouthCoast Wind approval,Anastasia E. Lennon | The New Bedford Light,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/boem-seeks-revocation-of-southcoast-wind-approval/,"If a federal judge approves the request, it would deal a critical blow to the offshore wind project located 20 miles south of Nantucket.","The Interior Department agency regulating offshore wind development asked a federal judge on Thursday to revoke a key approval for the SouthCoast Wind project — an approval granted by the same agency in January in the final days of the Biden administration.
If the federal government’s request is approved, it would deal another blow to the beleaguered project — which has been delayed at least two years due to the Trump administration — and the industry at large. 
This is the second time in a week that the administration has sought a remand of an offshore wind project approval, the other being for Maryland’s US Wind project. It comes just weeks after the Interior Department in court filings expressed its intent to remand not only its approval for SouthCoast Wind, but also New England Wind — two important projects for Massachusetts and New Bedford. 
[RELATED: Trump administration halts CT offshore wind project]
While the January approval, formally termed the Construction and Operations Plan (COP), gave the green light for construction, SouthCoast Wind was still hamstrung by three outstanding federal permits, and no power purchase agreement with Massachusetts or Rhode Island. 
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management filed the motion as part of a lawsuit brought by the Town of Nantucket in March against BOEM and Interior’s approval of the project, which calls for up to 147 turbines and would sit about 20 miles south of Nantucket (and south of Vineyard Wind). 
This latest move illustrates the growing role that lawsuits brought by municipalities and activist groups against offshore wind are playing in President Trump’s crackdown on the industry. Of the 20 or so actions and orders issued since January, one has directed federal attorneys to review pending litigation against projects and consider a remand of permits that the litigation contests. 
“BOEM is reviewing its approvals associated with the Project and has determined, based on its review to date, that it wishes to reconsider its COP approval. That is reason enough to grant a remand,” the new motion states. 
Nantucket is asking the federal government to “set aside” its record of decision approving SouthCoast Wind and restart its environmental review — a process that took more than three years to complete and culminated in key permits allowing the project to move toward construction. 
In Thursday’s filing, the government suggested the town’s concerns (and lawsuit) may become moot: “BOEM likely will take a further agency action, and that action may affect — and possibly moot — Plaintiffs’ claims.”
The motion and a declaration filed by BOEM Deputy Director Matthew Giacona are littered with references to Trump’s day-one wind memo and the subsequent actions that it has borne.
This includes the withdrawal of a 2021 opinion on how the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) should be interpreted, and the reinstatement of an opinion from the first Trump administration on the law. The motion states that BOEM staff are reevaluating all agency decisions that relied on the since-withdrawn 2021 opinion, which also informed the approval of New England Wind.
Under the reinstated opinion, Giacona said, SouthCoast Wind’s COP approval may not be compliant with OCSLA. 
“BOEM determined that it ‘may have failed to account for all the impacts that the SouthCoast Wind Project may cause,’” the motion states. “BOEM also found that the Environmental Impact Statement and other record documents may have ‘understated or obfuscated impacts that could have subsequently been improperly weighed in making the determinations.’”
Giacona’s declaration also appears to call into question the lease itself, which SouthCoast Wind paid millions for and has been paying hundreds of thousands in annual payments to the federal government since. 
He said the project-wide review, ordered under the day-one wind memo, “could result in identifying potential issues with SouthCoast’s lease” and that the timeline for that review is “uncertain.” 
Ocean Winds North America, the project’s parent company, in a statement to The Light said it plans to “vigorously defend our permits in federal court.” 
“SouthCoast Wind’s Construction and Operations Plan (COP) was approved … after a rigorous four-year review,” the statement read. “This review reflected an extensive public process that incorporated feedback from federal and state government agencies, commercial ocean users, Tribal Nations, and many other stakeholders. Stable permitting for American infrastructure projects should be of top concern for anyone who wants to see continued investment in the United States.”
SouthCoast Wind is an intervenor in the case and opposed the government’s motion. The project plans to use the Port of New Bedford for staging out of the Marine Commerce Terminal and for long-term operations and maintenance. 
Mayor Jon Mitchell previously said a delay or cancellation of New England Wind and SouthCoast Wind could mean a loss of up to 200 jobs in the city.
According to Oceantic Network, an organization supporting the industry, SouthCoast Wind expects to invest $6 billion in the U.S. through wages for union labor; shipbuilding with a Louisiana port and shipbuilder; steel from Alabama and Kentucky; and investments in port infrastructure, including the New Bedford terminal.
Gov. Maura Healey, in an emailed statement Friday, said the project will create “thousands of good-paying jobs” and provide reliable, affordable power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses. 
“This project has been thoroughly vetted and has already undergone years of expert review,” Healey said. “There is absolutely no need for the Trump Administration to reopen permitting processes and deny jobs, investment and energy power to the states.” 
Healey’s office did not respond to a question as to whether it plans to intervene. 
The request for a remand will be decided by a federal judge.
Per the federal government’s filing, “District courts have broad discretion to grant or deny remands and may deem a remand inappropriate ‘if the agency’s request appears to be frivolous or made in bad faith,’” but it also says courts “commonly” grant them. 
As this plays out, more than a dozen states, including Massachusetts, are waiting on a federal judge to rule whether Trump’s first-day wind memo, the action underlying all of this, is unlawful. It’s unclear when that decision will come, and what scope of relief it could provide to the states, which are relying on the projects to meet climate mandates and rising grid demand.

But the historically Black university, which has not been involved in the city’s ongoing lawsuit until now, was not forced to court over the issue. Instead, the university was the one who filed a grievance. It sought Wingate out for help with what it described as an insurmountable roadblock: Ted Henifin, the federal water receiver, who was refusing to permit the project to move forward. 
“It has an enrollment effect on us, a morale effect on us, and most important, an operational effect on us,” Vance Siggers, the director of campus operations, told Wingate, adding that each time the university experiences days without water, it loses “somewhere between 50 and 100 students just on the basis of we don’t have water on campus.”

The two sides mostly talked past each other during the Thursday proceedings, with Jackson State contending that it was not attempting to build its own water system for human consumption. The university has been working on this project since the 2022 water crisis disrupted the fall semester for weeks. 
Henifin, backed by testimony from the Mississippi State Department of Health, responded that the university’s plan for the backup tanks did not follow safety regulations. That’s in part because, during emergencies, health officials said the plan would route nonpotable water through the same pipes the university normally uses to deliver potable water to the kitchen and dormitories. 
“Looking back, it would have been great to work with them from the very beginning,” Henifin said. “At the end of the day, Jackson State hired an engineering firm and they should have reached out to the health department. … It’s engineering malpractice that they got this far along.” 
Wingate began the proceedings by reading aloud a Sept. 11 letter he received from the university’s lobbyist. The letter described how Jackson State has a looming deadline to spend $8 million in pandemic relief funds administered by the Department of Finance and Administration to install four water tanks on its campus as part of a plan designed by a local contractor, the Pickering Firm. 
Those tanks, which can’t be returned, are currently sitting unused on state property because Henifin will not sign a document that the Mississippi State Department of Health needs in order to formally review Jackson State’s plans. 
Instead, the letter portrayed Henifin as pulling strings with the health department to block the project. JSU claimed Henifin had wrongly surmised that the university was attempting to build its own water system. 
“Our goal is not to create a new water system but to ensure access to backup water tanks to prevent our students from experiencing water shortages,” Jacqueline Anderson-Woods wrote to Wingate, hoping the plea would lead the judge to force JXN Water’s approval
Over the next three hours, Wingate attempted to unpack the disagreement, an effort that involved testimony from Henifin, Siggers and Bill Moody, the director of the health department’s public water supply division. 
The university argued it does not want to build an independent water system and will continue to draw from the city’s water system and pay its bills. 
“This is not an independent water system, this is a backup water system,” Siggers said. “We still have to cut those 18 payments a month that I will sign off on every month.” 
Siggers described what he envisioned: During periods when issues with the city’s water system resulted in low water pressure on campus, the university could trigger the backup water tanks to keep its cooling and heating systems going.
Students could use the backup water to flush toilets and shower so they did not have to leave their dorms to use portable toilets, such as during the 2022 water crisis. Dining hall staff could continue to use the water to keep the kitchen clean. 
“It is important that we keep a certain level of PSIs on campus for student use in residence halls such as flushing toilets, shower needs, and washing,” he said. “Over in the dining facility, it is used for back-up such as maintaining cleanliness in the dining facilities while we serve our students.”

When the university reached out to Henifin after learning he was blocking the project, Siggers said they did not receive a response. Henifin even ignored a letter from Alfred Rankins, the commissioner of the university’s board, the Institutions of Higher Learning, in support of the project. 
In response to Siggers’ testimony, Henifin told Wingate he was “very confused” because as far as he knew, there was no way in the proposed design for the university to separate nonpotable water that goes to a shower from potable water that goes to a bathroom sink. 
“They don’t have a dual-pipe system where they can put nonpotable water into their system and only go to toilets for flushing,” Henifin told Wingate. “If it goes into a shower, people open their mouths when they shower.  Nonpotable water is not allowed to be used in showers in buildings.”
Henifin also noted that if Jackson State is storing unused water in these tanks for months, bacteria or other contaminants are likely to grow. That means if there is a possibility students could consume the water, the university must treat it — which requires obtaining the necessary regulations, hiring a water operator and conducting regular testing. 
“As the protector of Jackson’s water … I cannot sign off on anything that may cause people to have contaminated water,” he said. 
The first Henifin learned of the project was when the contractor reached out to ask about an “infrastructure tie-in,” he said.  He added that he thought improvements JXN Water had made to the city’s delivery system, including winterizing its facilities, meant Jackson State no longer needed to pursue this project. 
This testimony led Wingate to call on the Mississippi State Department of Health. Bill Moody, the director of the department’s bureau of public water supply, told Wingate he had determined that regardless of university’s intent, it was seeking to build a system intended for “consumptive” use. 
Moody had informally reviewed the plans, which the university had not provided to him until he issued a cease-and-desist order on the project in May. 
“The plans that I’m looking at fully indicated the water would be flowing into the tanks and flowing back out into the building using their pipes,” Moody said. 
Moody added the university could solve this if it routed the water from the tanks solely to mechanical systems like HVAC, so that students do not risk consuming the nonpotable water. 
Another solution would be for the university to become a public water system, a legal designation for a system that delivers drinkable water to more than 25 people for at least 60 days out of the year. 
But Jackson State kept reiterating to Wingate that it did not want to become a public water system because it did not intend for students to drink its backup water, despite the testimony from the health department that its plans would result in students consuming nonpotable water. 
“This goal is to be achieved by installation of above ground tanks on the customer side of existing taps to distribute water to dining services, campus housing, the student health center,” said Monica Davis Allen, an attorney for the university. “The intention is to ensure continuous campus operation and not for human consumption.” 
At the end of the proceedings, Wingate asked Jackson State to submit a brief to the court within five days as to whether it was building a public water system.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/06145608/3X0A3209-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-19 12:58:24.541544

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird is leading a group of states in advocating for free speech on college campuses and calling on university leadership to not give into the “Assassin’s Veto,” according to a letter released Thursday.
The letter cautions college officials against stifling free speech and debate in the name of protecting it through unfair or disproportionate security measures and costs. This move comes after the Iowa Board of Regents directed public universities to quickly investigate and censure, up to job termination, employees alleged to have posted negative comments about right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk.
Kirk was shot and killed Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University during a public debate event.
“The tragedy of Charlie Kirk’s assassination is a sobering reminder that the right to free speech must be protected,” Bird said in a press release on the letter. “Charlie was murdered while debating on a university campus, a place where the free exchange of ideas should be encouraged; we cannot allow the actions of an assassin to stop free speech in any way. Colleges and universities must take steps to keep their students safe while preserving free discussion and open debate.”

Citing 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, the letter stated requiring “exorbitant” security fees for certain groups or events based on the content or viewpoint expressed by the speech can go against the First Amendment.
The letter cited the University of New Mexico’s attempt in 2023 to impose security fees totaling more than $5,000 on Turning Point USA — co-founded by Kirk — for an event hosted by the organization where “conservative speaker” Riley Gaines was set to appear. A judge issued a preliminary injunction against the college for the fees, the letter stated.
University security policies must be transparent and nondiscriminatory, the letter stated, and security fees must be decided upon in a “content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral manner.” Facility use policies should follow these rules as well, and ensuring the safety of eventgoers and participants should be handled by the institution rather than act as a barrier for certain types of speech, it added.
If universities advertise themselves as being open for public speech and debate, placing more scrutiny and fees on conservative speakers and events — or refusing to host them altogether — while not doing the same for politically neutral or liberal speakers could also violate state Consumer Fraud Acts or Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices laws, the letter stated.
Bird was joined in signing the letter by attorney generals of 16 states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah. Each of the state leaders will investigate any complaints relating to these topics made against universities, the letter stated.
“We trust that you will continue to take steps to keep your campuses safe,” the letter stated. “And we also trust that you won’t use safety as a pretext to silence debate, at a time when it is sorely needed.”

Though still below pre-pandemic levels and its 2000s peak, Vermont’s growing prison population has caused overcrowding across the system. The state is assessing its options.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
With Vermont’s prisons reaching capacities they haven’t hit since the onset of Covid-19, Vermont Department of Corrections officials are grappling with how to handle the influx of people incarcerated. 
The state now incarcerates more women than it has beds at its lone women’s prison. In some facilities, people are sleeping on temporary plastic “sled beds” on cell floors. The growing population means prison officials are now considering sending more people to a private prison in Mississippi. 
In just two years, Vermont’s prison population has risen by almost 300, from 1,366 in September 2023 to more than 1,650 today. To be sure, the level is below the roughly 1,750 seen in 2019 and a peak of more than 2,200 in the late 2000s. State data shows the detainee population — people jailed while awaiting trial — is rising more rapidly than the sentenced population.
At the same time, Vermont’s prisons have experienced persistent staffing shortages. This week, WCAX reported on a lack of officers at Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport leading to continued mandatory overtime for staff. That facility’s vacancy rate for officers and shift supervisors is 28%, while the state’s five other facilities have vacancy rates between 10% and 20%, according to department data.  
According to Joshua Rutherford, the department’s facilities division deputy director, the state always expected the prison population to rise.
“Starting this spring, that has accelerated, and we started to fill up faster than we had anticipated,” he said in an interview Thursday. “Nobody calls me to ask how many beds I have before they impose a sentence.”
Plans to reopen three units in three different prisons this month should help ease the problem, Rutherford said. Those units had been shuttered during Covid due to staffing shortages and a decreased population. But with some people forced to sleep on temporary floor beds, and the state’s only women’s prison now over capacity, the situation requires immediate action and creative thinking. 
Why are more people in prison?
Corrections leaders, lawmakers and Vermont’s chief superior court judge have all suggested a combination of factors contributing to the spike. Pandemic-era policies meant fewer police interactions and some people released from prison — initiatives that have since ended. Some crimes, both violent and nonviolent, have increased. 
Public and political demands for more accountability have increased, too, as concerns about crime in downtowns — particularly in Burlington — have grown. 
The Vermont Legislature has also created new and stricter crimes. In July 2024, Vermont’s bail laws changed, allowing judges to increase the amount of bail for defendants who were accused of crimes while out on release in other cases. 
Chief Superior Court Judge Thomas Zonay told lawmakers last week that that change may be increasing the number of detainees. He compared recent bail data to that from May 2024. Over that time, the number of people held on less than $10,000 bail increased by more than 60%, or about 50 people. A similar increase wasn’t seen in other bail amounts that were unlikely to be impacted by the recent legislation. 
About 40 more people are held without bail now than were in May 2024, a number that reflects people held for serious felony charges. 
The confluence of changes means that for the first time in years, Vermont’s prisons are overfull or close to it. 
Data from this week showed all of Vermont’s six prisons had at least one general population unit at or over capacity. 
At the women’s prison, Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, 180 women were squeezed into a facility with only 118 general population beds and 164 currently operating beds.
The 183 women incarcerated across Vermont as of Thursday is also more than the 158-bed plan previously proposed for a replacement women’s prison and reentry facility.

 A similar pattern appears across the system. Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland, Northeast Correctional Complex in St. Johnsbury, Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town and Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield all have general population units detaining more people than the number of available beds, according to Department of Corrections data. 
Overcrowding leads to ‘ugly’ conditions
For Rutherford, the corrections official focused on population, the spike in people incarcerated is forcing him and colleagues to come up with less-than-ideal solutions. 
In the past, the state utilized prisons’ gymnasium space for extra beds. The department is already utilizing temporary plastic beds on the floor of cells.

When the state’s prisons reach capacity, Vermont sends people out of state. Through the state’s contract with CoreCivic, one of the country’s largest private prison companies, Vermont sends just under 130 men to Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi — about half of 2019’s out-of-state population. 
The CoreCivic contract currently allows Vermont to utilize up to 300 beds, but only for men — meaning overcrowding at the South Burlington women’s prison poses a trickier problem at the moment. 
“Increased reliance on out-of-state (prisons) is absolutely a possibility,” Rutherford said, specifically referencing the male population.  
Tim Burgess, an advocate for incarcerated people in Vermont, experienced overcrowding himself while in prison in the state in the 2000s. At the time, the Department of Corrections was utilizing sled beds.
“Picture a red sled like you use to go sledding. It’s a little longer, it looks a little like a narrow canoe. If you’re a larger person, it is about as comfortable as you’d think it would be,” he said. 
In a tight two-man cell, furnished with a bunk bed, a desk and toilet, the person in the sled bed typically finds themself wedged somewhere near the toilet. 
“It’s ugly,” Burgess said. 
Matt Valerio, Vermont’s defender general, said sled beds are a sanitary issue. He said recent instances of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria MRSA at the Rutland prison, where the temporary beds have been utilized, has caused concern.
(A department spokesperson said there were a “small number” of MRSA cases system wide this summer, declining to provide specifics due to medical privacy concerns.) 
After 25 years on the job, Valerio is familiar with the era when Vermont incarcerated far more people and sent hundreds more out of state. 
“The biggest issue I see right now is we have a massive detention population,” he said. The more than 650 people currently detained while awaiting trial is two or three times higher than in the past, according to Valerio. 
The overall upward trend in incarceration, Valerio argued, could be traced in part to political and public pressure in response to concerns about public safety. That pressure can swing the pendulum in instances where there’s discretion — judges issuing bail, the Department of Corrections releasing people on furlough and the parole board approving parole, he said. 
To Valerio, it was a “no brainer” that the state’s prison population would rise from pandemic lows. “The real question is how high is it going to go. And what’s going to happen — where are we going to put them?”

The U.S. immigration court system does have a backlog of nearly 3.8 million cases as of the third quarter of 2025. But, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, the average wait time for all cases was about 1.7 years as of earlier this year.
Asylum cases take much longer, however, with the National Immigration Forum reporting in early 2024 an estimated wait time of 4.3 years. There are nearly 2.4 million asylum seekers’ cases pending as of the third quarter of 2025.
The backlog is driven by the high number of applications, especially from people seeking protection from persecution, a shortage of immigration judges and support staff, and frequent policy changes that complicate proceedings. Even with recent efforts to hire judges and create new processing dockets, the system is still overwhelmed.

Heather Cloud, R-Turkey Creek, said the state should explore creative solution to bringing down the costs of covering GLP-1 drugs in health insurance plans.(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Expenses have surged for Louisiana’s public worker health insurance plans as more people are prescribed GLP-1 drugs, known by brand names such as Ozempic and Mounjaro. The diabetes drugs are now commonly thought of as weight-loss medications, though that use isn’t covered by Louisiana state health benefits.

Even with GLP-1 coverage prohibited for obesity treatment, the state Office of Group Benefits spends $200 million per year on the drugs and is “adding people everyday,” CEO Heath Williams said Thursday at legislative finance committee meeting.

“We’re going to go Ozempic-broke,” Sen. Heather Cloud, R-Turkey Creek, said. 
Over the past six years, GLP-1 drugs have replaced Metformin, a cheaper, but sometimes less effective, Type 2 diabetes drug. By comparison, Metformin cost the state $2 million annually when it was doctors’ go-to prescription, Williams said. 

“We are moving members from very inexpensive drugs to very expensive drugs – to the tune of $20 drugs to $1,200 drugs per month,” he told lawmakers. 
The Office of Group Benefits provides insurance coverage to 212,000 people, including state employees, public school teachers, some local government workers, their family members as well as public sector retirees. Its expenditures are around $2 billion per year, and the money comes partly from premium payments plan members make. 
Legislators approved contracts Thursday with new pharmacy benefit managers, who help negotiate drug prices for insurance plans. The contractors, Livinti and SilverScript, will be required to provide more transparency about what is driving the high number of GLP-1 prescriptions being written, Williams said 

Earlier this year, legislators approved a state budget that would have covered the cost of GLP-1 prescriptions for public workers to treat obesity, but Gov. Jeff Landry vetoed that provision.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
“These drugs can cost $1,000 a month per person,” Landry wrote in his June letter to state lawmakers explaining the veto. “Even temporary coverage could set expectations for long-term use that Louisiana simply cannot afford.”
Legislators attending Thursday’s meeting blamed pharmaceutical companies for the high cost of GLP-1 drugs, saying the same medications cost far less in other countries. 

Cloud said the state should consider a workaround where compounded versions of GLP-1s – essentially copycat versions of the medication that are more affordable but not vetted by federal officials – would be covered by the state health insurance plan.
“To me, that is our only path forward right now is to figure out how to cover [the compounds],” Cloud said.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned earlier this month against using compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs however. The agency has not reviewed the compounds for safety, effectiveness and quality. 

“A compounded drug might be appropriate if a patient’s medical need cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug, or the FDA-approved drug is not commercially available. However, compounded drugs are not FDA approved,” the agency said in a statement released Sept. 5.
Such compounded versions are already used broadly in the public because the medications’ costs are high and insurance coverage is limited.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_1289-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 11:59:40.356313

A federal judge ruled Friday that Mizzou Students for Justice in Palestine can participate in next weekend’s Homecoming parade, as long as they comply with the university’s parade policy.


In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephen Bough noted that while the court finds that the organization must be permitted to participate in the parade, nothing in the order prohibits the University of Missouri from enforcing the requirements of the parade policy.


Earlier this year, the university updated its Homecoming parade policy to exclude political expression. The new policy also denies participation of organizations that don’t adhere to the parade’s “black and gold” theme.
According to the updated policy, “the purpose of the Homecoming parade is to celebrate Mizzou and its supporters. It is not a venue for protests.”
Todd McCubbin, executive director of the Mizzou Alumni Association, told the judge during a hearing Tuesday that the organization’s 2025 application would likely be preliminarily approved, and the Office of Alumni Engagement would work with the group to ensure it complied with the parade policy.


Last month, Mizzou Students for Justice in Palestine sued Mun Choi, president of the University of Missouri System, to secure a place in the parade.


In the lawsuit, the group argued that Choi violated the students’ First Amendment rights by forbidding them to participate in the parade because of their views on Israel and Palestine.


In his ruling, the judge agreed with the organization that there is more than a “fair chance” that Choi’s denial of their participation in the parade violates the First Amendment.

In the Tuesday hearing, Choi ‘s legal team argued that the denial was largely based on safety concerns. They  cited two prior incidents involving a member of the group that resulted in a student conduct charge for stalking and a restriction that limits her presence on campus to academic purposes.


The legal team also noted incidents of violence at student protests on other university campuses nationwide as part of Choi’s rationale.


The court agreed that safety is a “significant [governmental] interest,” but aside from the instances involving one group member, could not find that Mizzou Students for Justice in Palestine had violated any university policy.


Thus, Choi’s decision to exclude the organization on the basis of safety could not be supported.


According to the ruling, “Dr. Choi’s decision to exclude the organization in its entirety is not narrowly tailored to the stated interest of safety. Dr. Choi ‘could, instead, forbid the specific student(s) giving rise to [safety] concerns’ from participating.”


Thus, assuming the Homecoming parade is an unlimited public forum, the court found Choi’s decision had been too narrowly applied.


Ultimately, the court decided that there was little evidence that the students had been engaged in or connected to any form of violence, and that denying their participation in the Homecoming parade would likely be a violation of the First Amendment’s free speech clause.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)“Property values are going to go down, utility bills are going to go up as a result. And I think there’s a huge issue when it comes to, one, putting these lines through communities,” U.S. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, told the State Corporation Commissioners and a packed school auditorium of local residents Thursday night at the first SCC public hearing about Dominion Energy’s proposed high-powered transmission lines, which slated to cut through Northern Virginia neighborhoods.
Hundreds of community members in the three Loudoun Valley Estates neighborhoods showed up  to the hearing to push back against plans for the 500kv lines to be built in their backyards. Dominion has told state regulators the lines are necessary to bring more energy to data centers. All three commissioners listened to the worries of community members, many of whom have been mounting a vigorous campaign to educate the public about what the project could mean for their home values and safety.
The 165 foot towers would carry power from substations in the area to complete the “reliability loop of power” that will help energize  hundreds of data centers just outside Ashburn, in  so-called Data Center Alley.
“My power needs are being met. These are being built for the rapidly expanding data centers. So let the data center industry pay for this solution, not the families and ratepayers living under the power lines,” said Jatinder Chandok, a resident of Loudoun Valley Estates. 
The Golden to Mars transmission line will be the final piece of the loop. Two-thirds of it have already been approved and are in different stages of development. There are six different routes Dominion proposed to the SCC for the Golden to Mars line but some face more challenges than others.
Golden to Mars
Two of the proposed lines for the last part of the loop, routes three and four, run along Loudoun County Public Schools property near Rock Ridge High School and Rosa Lee Carter Elementary School. The school board has rejected the lines being near school property and the SCC can’t make the schools put the lines on their property. 
“(Route 3) remains our preferred route, and we are hoping to begin another conversation with the Loudoun County Public Schools,”  Rob Richardson with Dominion said at Thursday’s meeting.
Some residents spoke of wanting the lines to be buried underground, and signs with slogans supporting that solution dot the front yards of homes surrounding the area. Dominion has said that burying the lines is too costly, there isn’t enough land available for the lines to run underground, and there are underground utilities that could get in the way. 
“The lack of land for transition stations is one (issue). The presence of diabase rock, which impacts construction, and other underground utilities are another. One significant issue also is the time to construct it would take longer than is needed,” Richardson said.
If the school board does not change course, then the lines would have to go through another proposed route that cuts through the yards of some of the Loudoun Valley Estates residents, who live atop the hill next to the high school or along the Loudoun County Parkway. They fear the health impacts of the high-voltage lines being so close to their homes, and are concerned they may be forced to leave or see their home values tank. 
The county Board of Supervisors previously voted against routes one, two, and five because they believe the look of the powerlines along the parkway do not fit the aesthetic character of the area. They also suggested that any lines that come within 500 feet of a school or home should be buried, which would be an unenforceable recommendation. One of the board members, along with several of the homeowners, said this could be a chance for Dominion to set an example of responsibility by burying lines as power demands grow.
“An investment in a pilot program to underground part of this line will provide a new approach to minimizing and mitigating the impacts on residential communities that will be increasingly impacted by transmission lines to serve data centers,” Loudoun County Supervisor Laura TeKrony said. “Loudoun County has lower taxes because of data centers, but data centers are lowering the value of the county as a desirable place to live because of the industrialization that transmission lines and substations are creating.”
A number of state lawmakers have urged the SCC to consider if the line at the center of the controversy is truly needed and to conduct independent research into the feasibility of burying all the lines.
Dominion has stated that if this power loop is not completed, it could damage their equipment and create an energy gap for the data centers. There is also the possibility of violations from the grid operator PJM for not providing that power.
Commissioners said that over 1550 pages of public comment have been submitted on this case already. A second public hearing is being held at the Rock Ridge High School on Sept. 29 ahead of the December case in Richmond. A decision on the powerlines is not anticipated until 2026.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0333-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 11:59:40.356313

This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.
Pennsylvania is due to receive US$2.2 billion dollars from the national opioid settlements, and a new database shows the public where that money is going.
Starting in 2021, a national, bipartisan coalition of attorneys general, including now-Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, reached settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors who had directly contributed to the opioid addiction crisis.
That year, over 5,000 Pennsylvanians died from unintended drug overdoses. That number has since dropped, falling to about 3,300 in 2024.
The opioid settlement payments, which began in 2022 and are slated to continue until 2038, are supposed to fund opioid overdose prevention, treatment, harm reduction, recovery support and other programs. This includes a broad array of interventions in Pennsylvania, from first-responder training for law enforcement to handle people who have overdosed to stigma reduction education and support for medication-assisted treatment, to name just a few.
We are researchers from Penn State University, Temple University and the University of Pittsburgh who helped build a website, which launched in August 2025, that publishes and tracks opioid settlement fund spending data in Pennsylvania.

Disclosure: Jonathan Larsen receives funding from the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust. He is the Chair of the Haverford Township Democratic Committee. Amy Yeung receives funding from the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust Dennis Scanlon receives funding from the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust. Renee Cloutier receives funding from the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust.

We are partnering with the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust, the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Career Development Association. Our team receives funding through the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust to help the trust with data collection, analysis and web design. However, our website is separate and independent from the trust.
Here are five things we believe Pennsylvania residents ought to know about the spending data, and how it can be used to improve public health:
1. Counties are in the driver’s seat
Out of the 48 states that have received settlements so far, Pennsylvania is one of nine states that have given majority control of settlement spending to local governments.
In Pennsylvania’s case, 70% of the funding goes to counties. Cities and other organizations that were involved in the lawsuits, such as county district attorney offices, get 15%. The remaining 15% goes to the state.
This means that in Pennsylvania, it is mostly up to counties to determine how to best spend the US$2.2 billion. Counties must interact directly with their communities through requests for proposals to distribute funds. They will face critical decisions about how to invest the funds in ways that move beyond pilot programs to sustainable, system-level change.
Requirements from the opioid settlement to spend at least 85% of the money on opioid abatement aim to avoid pitfalls of the 1990s tobacco settlement, when funds were often diverted to general budgets and spent on programs unrelated to getting people to quit smoking.
States that have not given majority control of settlement spending to local governments have created a variety of ways to spend the money. These include a mix of state and local disbursement, as well as special fund-governing bodies charged with deciding how settlement funds are distributed. In some states, the state is the primary decision-maker about how settlement funds are used.
The requirement in Pennsylvania that opioid settlement funds are primarily sent to counties creates an opportunity for local innovation. It will also, eventually, allow experts to evaluate the effectiveness of this local control of funds compared with state control or other structures.
A screenshot from the Pennsylvania Opioid Settlement Data dashboard shows that Philadelphia has so far spent about $20 million of the $80 million it has received, with nearly $6 million going toward the city’s housing programs for people experiencing homelessness. Pennsylvania Opioid Settlement Data
2. Website improves transparency and accountability
When members of the public can see where the money is going, they can hold systems accountable for using the funds effectively. County leaders, meanwhile, can see what programs are currently being funded in other counties that they may want to replicate or scale up.
3. Spending is a marathon, not a sprint
Settlement dollars are just beginning to be distributed and spent. According to the tracker, over $80 million had been spent on approved opioid remediation programs as of Dec. 31, 2024. Settlement payments will continue over the next seven to 18 years, varying by company.
This is a marathon and not a sprint, so communities and decision-makers will have to balance spending that produces short- and longer-term objectives.
Additionally, not all counties are receiving the same amount of money, and that affects what they can do with it.
4. New challenges will arise in opioid crisis
Emerging issues in the opioid crisis will continue to evolve, such as how contaminants like the animal tranquilizers xylazine and medetomidine, or products derived from kratom, a tropical tree, have entered the street drug supply in recent years.
Systematically tracking data will help expand our knowledge base of all programs in Pennsylvania that aim to address the opioid crisis. Some of these programs are based on strong existing evidence, while others will help to build new evidence, especially considering the ever-changing landscape of the crisis.
5. Funding gaps will remain
Opioid settlement funds are an important opportunity to address the opioid crisis, but will not on their own cover all funding gaps needed to address the crisis or the broader public health crises that are its major drivers. These include food and housing insecurity, unemployment, lack of access to mental health care, and so many other related issues.
As the country faces major and rapid federal disinvestment in states and communities, these funding gaps will grow and increase the pressure on local decision-makers to make the most of each dollar while demonstrating evidence of impact.

Nonprofits, such as those that get federal money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, are distributing rent assistance payments that are 14% higher than in 2024 and 49% higher than in 2020 to keep pace with rental costs. Now, the average rental subsidy given across all Connecticut regions is over $1,000.
The annual Point-In-Time Count of Homelessness report, which referenced the data, said, “these agencies that provide rental subsidies … continue to face an uphill battle trying to bridge the gap from what someone can afford versus how much they can subsidize. Also there continues to be a struggle for the providers to find units whose rents are within the FMR [Fair Market Rents] and/or reasonable, thus further draining the pool of available and acceptable units.”
Connecticut ranked eighth-highest in the nation in 2024 for the cost of rental housing.

Summaries of chat logs, a map of users’ internet addresses and a list of other activity on May’s devices included in court filings this week give the most detailed picture so far of the case prosecutors plan to build against May during his trial, which is scheduled to begin Oct. 9.
May, who is representing himself, is attempting to get much of the evidence thrown out. He argues that an investigating agent made contradictory statements when seeking warrants used to search his house and get data directly from messaging site Kik.
A previous attorney for May suggested a political enemy could have hacked into his internet to send the videos. And May has said in messages sent from his jail cell, using a monitored tablet, that he expects the prosecution’s case to fail because his devices had no videos of child sex abuse saved on them.
In handwritten court filings, May asked U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, who is presiding over the case, to either throw out all evidence found on the 35 electronic devices seized from his home in August 2024 or allow prosecutors to use only what was found on the phone itself, not in any apps.
May is also asking to change the location of his trial out of Columbia, citing the extensive news coverage of his case, according to a court filing that included dozens of stories from local, statewide and national news outlets and blogs.
Meanwhile, the case’s prosecutors are asking Currie to allow them to reference videos beyond the 10 that May is charged with sending, as well as additional chat messages and internet searches, according to court filings.
Former Rep. May to represent himself in trial on charges of sending child sex abuse videos

May objected to the request. May and prosecutors will argue their motions Wednesday in front of Currie.
Prosecutors charged May with distributing 10 videos of children being sexually abused, but the Kik account prosecutors claim he operated had 220 distinct videos stored, investigators have said. The user sent messages containing those videos 21 times in group chats and 458 times to individual users over the course of the five days the account existed, according to court filings.
“The videos showed infant and toddler children being subjected to severe forms of sex abuse; some of the videos included physical violence and abuse involving animals,” the court filing reads.
The videos and messages are “all a part of a single five-day child pornography spree,” prosecutors wrote. Taken together, they show the videos were sent intentionally and involved preparation, the court filing reads.
May remains in the Edgefield County jail without bond. If he is convicted, he could spend between five and 20 years in prison for each of the 10 charges he faces, Currie has said. Conviction could also mean paying thousands of dollars in fines, she said.
Messages to users across the globe
On April 3, a user whose internet address appeared to be based in the United Kingdom messaged joebidennnn69, “Got any moms and daughters?”
“Yeah,” replied joebidennnn69, from South Carolina. “Send 3 and I’ll go find it. You got more mom daughter?”
Messages from joebidennnn69, including those containing videos of child sexual abuse, went to 46 different users in 18 states and five different countries, according to court filings.

A registered nurse in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was arrested and charged with receiving and possessing child sexual abuse material last month after investigators determined he was one of the users exchanging videos with joebidennnn69.
It’s unclear whether any of the other users believed to be sending and receiving videos over Kik have been charged.
Investigators used distinctive internet signals, known as IP addresses, to trace the users across the globe. In the same way, they pinpointed the joebidennnn69 account to May’s home and cellphone, according to court filings.
Using the Wi-Fi at May’s West Columbia home, the joebidennnn69 account sent 432 videos and images over the course of five days. Another 19 were sent using cellular data connected to May’s cellphone. And 28 were sent over a virtual private network, or VPN, to encrypt the location data, according to court filings.
After asking about preferences or requesting certain content, users often spent hours sending videos back and forth, usually in groups of two or three, according to eight chat logs prosecutors included with their court filing. The videos ranged in length from 14 seconds to just over two minutes, prosecutors wrote.
During May’s June detention hearing, the attorney representing him at the time argued an unnamed political enemy had hacked into May’s home Wi-Fi using a password visible in the back of a photo May’s wife posted on Facebook and sent the videos.
That person would have also needed access to May’s phone over the same five days to account for the other messages, prosecutors have argued. May’s phone received more than 450 notifications from Kik during that five-day span, according to the court filing.
His phone’s data showed the app was deleted April 4, 2024.
Simultaneous messages
May’s internet activity during the Kik conversations helps tie him to the messages, prosecutors argued in a court filing.
Several times, a topic would come up in a Kik chat, then appear in the search history on May’s laptop.
One Kik user, on April 4, 2024, asked joebidennnn69 for “hebe,” a shorthand for hebephilia, which is a sexual preference for children between the ages of 11 and 14. Two minutes later, a search appeared on May’s laptop for “hebe meaning,” followed by searches for hebephile and hebephilia, according to court filings.
During his detention hearing, investigators said May likely didn’t know the meaning of the term because the videos sent through joebidennnn69 suggested a preference for younger children.

Soon after another user told joebidennnn69, “You need to get telegram,” on April 1, 2024, a search for the encrypted app showed up on May’s laptop. His phone downloaded the app less than an hour later, then received login codes, according to court filings.
Telegram, along with encrypted apps Mega and Sessions, were deleted from May’s phone around the same time as Kik, investigators said. Unlike Kik, which is based in the United States, the other apps have headquarters overseas, making search warrants impossible for investigators to get. And unlike Kik, messages sent over those apps are encrypted, a special agent testified during the detention hearing.
Some of the messages seemed to coincide with other activity on May’s phone and laptop, including work for his consulting firm, Ivory Tusk Consulting, and legislative research, implying May was the one using the devices at the time, according to court filings.
On April 3, 2024, May sent an email from his laptop to a political consultant and a fellow legislator. Twenty seconds later, the joebidennnn69 account responded to a Kik message about a “trade” with, “If you got good stuff.”
Within seconds, May followed up on his email with a text message, as videos rolled into the Kik account, along with the message, “Like this?” The joebidennnn69 user responded almost immediately with two files, one of which is included in the videos May is charged with sending.
Six minutes later, May’s laptop registered a Google search for “Fauci and Biden,” apparently referring to former President Joe Biden and his chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0994-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 10:57:58.666496

(Photo by Julia Tilton / The Daily Yonder)At a dock along the banks of the Cousins River, Chad Strater loaded up his small aluminum workboat with power tools and a winch. Strater, who owns a marine construction business, was setting out to tinker with floating equipment at a nearby oyster farm. On the quiet morning in August, with the sun already beating down hard, his vessel whirred to life, only without the usual growl of an oil-guzzling motor. The boat is all electric.
Just north of where the Cousins River meets Casco Bay, Willy Leathers was powering up his own electric watercraft, which had its first outing in July. Leathers uses his 28-foot boat for cultivating oysters at Maine Ocean Farms, where roughly 3 million of the animals grow in dozens of floating cages.
Both Strater and Leathers said they switched to electric workboats for several reasons. Their new watercraft are a cleaner alternative to the smelly, polluting petroleum-powered vessels that dominate Maine’s 3,500 miles of coastline. Electric propulsion is also significantly quieter than a gas or diesel motor. For Leathers, whose 10-acre sea farm is a significant presence in the cove where he operates, the swap is about being a good neighbor to the shoreside community.
“It’s an innovation born from necessity for us,” said Strater about his electric boat, which he docks each night at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, the nonprofit boatyard and aquaculture innovation hub he runs with several other small business owners. “[The boat] really works well for what we do with it, and we’re letting farmers use it to see how it could work for them.”
Battery-powered vessels are starting to catch on in the United States and worldwide as companies and maritime authorities work to reduce emissions and improve the experience of cruising waterways. The technology ranges from small outboard motors on workboats and recreational watercraft to powerful inboard systems on ferries, tugboats, and supply vessels for offshore wind farms and oil rigs.
In recent decades, Norway, with its extensive coastline and ample government funding, has spearheaded the transition globally. China, which is both the world’s largest shipbuilder and battery manufacturer, has rapidly deployed hundreds of battery-powered vessels over the last several years. Falling battery costs, better technology, and stricter environmental rules are compelling some vessel owners to install partial or fully electric systems, primarily for watercraft that operate near the shore or on fixed routes. For commercial fishing in particular, customers are helping to drive the push to clean up.

“Everyone’s more concerned now with where their food comes from, and we’ve seen that [consumers] are looking for that complete sustainable supply chain,” said Ed Schwarz, the head of marine solutions sales in North America for Siemens Energy, which has built electric propulsion systems for U.S. ferries.
Electrification has only very recently come to America’s aquaculture sector. In Maine, the small but fast-growing segment includes nearly 200 farms for shellfish, fin fish, and edible seaweed. Strater and Leathers are among the first in their business to trade gas motors for electric propulsion — a switch they say they’re hoping to accelerate. Oil-guzzling motors are among the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions for the state’s multibillion-dollar seafood sector.

Still, electrifying commercial watercraft can be a difficult course to navigate, given the higher up-front costs of electric motors and the lack of charging infrastructure — and grid infrastructure in general — in rural waterfront communities.
Early adopters like Strater and Leathers said they hope the experiences gained from their demonstrations can help pave the way for decarbonizing Maine’s blue economy.  With the help of the Island Institute, a Maine-based nonprofit that works on marine-related energy transitions, Leathers is collecting performance data from his vessel to share more broadly with the industry.
“People say it looks cool and shiny and looks like it operates great,” Lia Morris, the Island Institute’s senior community development officer, said of electric boats. “But we really want to be able to prove out the [business] case.”

Electric boats can cost between 20% and 30% more than a gas- or diesel-powered vessel of a comparable size. However, owners can save on maintenance and fuel over the long term, Strater’s business partner Nick Planson said.
“The high-level math that we’ve come up with” is a financial break-even point of “about four to five years, and then over a 10-year time span, you’re definitely coming out way ahead based on the vastly reduced maintenance cost, replacement cost of failed equipment, and fuel costs,” said Planson.
But the initial price tag presents a significant hurdle. Strater and Planson’s sleekly designed, no-frills watercraft cost $100,000 to build and outfit with a single electric outboard motor. Leathers’ boat, called Heron, cost about four times more. It has two electric outboards and a ramp for unloading and hauling more than 10,000 oysters at a time from the sea farm to distributors waiting on the dock. Its hull is also equipped with a small cabin and toilet.
Both operations relied on grant funding to defray the expense of going electric.
For their part, Strater and Planson used about $50,000 from a larger U.S. Department of Agriculture small business grant they got in 2024 to establish a use case for electric workboats in the aquaculture industry. Leathers’ business, Maine Ocean Farms, was included on a collaborative $500,000 U.S. Department of Energy grant last year that earmarked about $289,000 for boat building and propulsion systems, in addition to other funds for charging infrastructure and data collection.

The prospects for funding future projects are now much murkier under the Trump administration, maritime policy experts say.
The DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which awarded the money to Maine Ocean Farms and its partners, is facing significant budget cuts in the next fiscal year. The GOP-backed spending law that passed in July rescinded some unobligated grant funding for cleaning up marine diesel engines. While other programs were spared, it’s unclear whether the current Congress will approve new funding for initiatives ranging from electrifying huge urban ports to deploying low-emissions ferries in rural communities.

But federal grants aren’t the only way to address the higher cost of electric boats. Strater and Planson also worked with Coastal Enterprises Inc., a Maine-based community development financial institution focused on climate resilience, to establish a “marine green” loan program that can make the up-front costs of switching to electric propulsion more accessible to small businesses.
“The more electric engines that are being employed in Maine helps lift the whole tide for everyone,” said Nick Branchina, director of CEI’s fisheries and aquaculture program. As part of its marine green lending, CEI offers loans starting at $25,000 for small businesses to make the switch to electric propulsion and comfortably afford the cost of batteries or a shoreside charging installation.
Planson said that as electrification moves beyond initial grant-funded projects, the challenge is keeping systems affordable. He said he wants to see other small business owners able to “take a reasonable swing” at electric propulsion.
Buying a boat, of course, is only the first obstacle. Electric vessel owners must also learn how to use their new propulsion systems and find a place to charge them.
This summer, Leathers said he’s had no trouble making the nearly two-mile round trip from the slip where he docks Heron in South Freeport, Maine, to his farm on Casco Bay. With a full charge, he can make trips slightly farther to meet distributors closer to Portland. But as temperatures drop this winter, Leathers said he’s not sure how far the outboards’ two batteries will take him. Cold weather can reduce battery capacity and impact performance, shrinking an electric motor’s range. It’s a part of Leathers’ demonstration to find out what the impacts are in practice.

Like Leathers, Strater and Planson also work year-round. They said they’re both impressed with how their boat performed last winter after launching in the fall of 2024. For Planson, who markets battery-powered equipment to aquaculture farmers as part of his startup, Shred Electric, a boat’s ability to run through the year’s coldest months is a key selling point.
“The proof is in the pudding,” said Planson. “When you’re working with … waterfront applications, it really needs to work every day and all year.”
Strater and Planson said their boat’s range was an important consideration when they partnered with the startup Flux Marine to build the electric outboard motor. With limited shoreside charging infrastructure in place, the boat has to make it out and back on a single charge, sometimes to aquaculture operations seven miles away. In the 10 months since the boat’s launch, Strater has learned range correlates to speed. He can modulate the boat’s pace depending on how far he wants to go.
“We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,” he said.
Soon, Maine’s early adopters will have shared access to a higher-capacity Level 2 charger that will be installed at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation and can charge batteries in little over two hours, or three times faster than the current system. The startup Aqua superPower was awarded a portion of the DOE funding last year to install additional marine chargers there and at a wharf in Portland owned by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Island Institute also helped with grant funding for the charger at the Sea Meadow boatyard.

Maine will need much more high-capacity charging infrastructure for the marine industry to transition to electric propulsion, said the Island Institute’s Morris. As the state’s aquaculture and fisheries industries look to grow beyond small-scale operations, other businesses will need to charge more frequently to make longer, farther trips up and down the coast.
Expanding charging stations north of Casco Bay represents what Morris calls a “chicken and egg” problem: a dynamic where chargers are either installed before demand gets high, and sit unused, or electric boats hit the water and there’s not enough charging infrastructure, stalling future adoption.
This challenge is compounded by both New England’s aging grid infrastructure and the remote nature of some of the region’s waterfront access points. Getting the right amount of power to a charging station on the shore can be costly, even in Yarmouth, which sits on Casco Bay. Often it’s the last mile that can be the most expensive. At Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, three-phase power, which can accommodate higher loads, is limited by the dirt road that separates the boat launch from the more heavily trafficked U.S. Route 1.
“There are a lot of complicated questions,” Morris said. “I don’t think it’s unique to Maine, it’s any rural area, but complicated questions and conversations with the utilities and the rural municipalities are going to have to be solved for.”
Back on the water, Leathers docked his electric boat, Heron, alongside the sea farm’s barge, where thousands of oysters pass through for processing on harvest days. He switched the motor off and hopped onto the floating platform. For a moment, the bay was calm to the point of near silence. Then Leathers picked up an oyster cage with a rattle, turning it over in his hands as water splashed out. The sounds of the workday began.
“As a whole industry, I think it’s going to take proving that someone like us can do it,” Leathers said. “And then the next person kind of snowballing after that.”

,DC,2025-09-19 14:49:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Chance of government shutdown rises as US Senate fails to advance spending bill,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/chance-government-shutdown-rises-us-senate-fails-advance-spending-bill,,"This report has been updatedWASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate deadlocked Friday over how to fund the government past a deadline at the end of September, escalating the odds of a shutdown and heightening tensions on Capitol Hill. Democrats blocked a seven-week stopgap spending bill that had passed the House just hours earlier, refusing to aid Republican leaders in getting the 60 votes needed to advance the legislation. Republicans also blocked a Democratic counter-proposal, a one-month stopgap bill that included several health care provisions. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters ahead of the votes that Democrats can either accept the GOP-drafted stopgap bill or shut the government down. President Donald Trump told Republicans they did not need to negotiate with Democrats on the legislation.“The choice is pretty clear. It's going to be funding the government through a clean, short-term continuing resolution or a government shutdown,” Thune said. “And that's the choice the Democrats have. The House has acted. The president's ready to sign the bill.”Complicating matters is the congressional calendar, which has both chambers out next week for Rosh Hashanah. The Senate’s not scheduled to return until Sept. 29, with less than 48 hours to broker a deal and get it to Trump’s desk. Thune said he’s not inclined to bring senators back early, despite the impasse.  “I’d say it’s unlikely we’ll be in next week but, obviously, you never completely shut the door,” Thune said. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters following his chamber’s vote on the stopgap he hadn’t decided whether to reconvene the House earlier than planned.“There’s a lot of discussion about it,” Johnson said. “The members have a lot of work to do in their districts as well, and so we try to balance those interests.”House Republicans announced later in the day the chamber wouldn’t come back until Oct. 1, essentially jamming the Senate with the GOP bill. Shutdown appearing more likelyDemocratic leaders have vowed not to help Republicans get the votes needed on their current stopgap — a stark contrast from March, when Senate Democrats did just that, leading to significant frustration from their House colleagues.The stalemate and congressional calendar have ratcheted up the odds of a protracted, deeply political government showdown that could last for weeks or even months. Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said during floor debate the only path away from a shutdown runs through bipartisan negotiations. “Why aren’t they willing to just meet and actually start charting a course on how we move forward? I think the main reason is Donald Trump,” Murray said. “He told Republicans, ‘Don’t even bother dealing with Democrats.’ It seems like Republican leaders are just afraid to cross the aisle and have a simple meeting, a mere conversation, if it risks losing Donald Trump.” Murray said that approach to governing will have significant consequences for major legislation, which requires the support of at least some Democratic senators to advance in a Senate with 53 GOP members. “So to get things done for our families back home, Republicans need to work with Democrats,” Murray said. “And if Republican leadership cannot find the courage to do that on what should be low-hanging fruit here, if they can’t sit down with our Democratic leadership to talk about a short-term CR, what does that mean for the work that we’ve been doing for our full-year spending bills? What does it mean for extending those health care tax credits? And what does it mean for any of the other challenging issues we would all like to work on together to address?""Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told reporters it’s “malpractice” and “bananas” that GOP leaders don’t plan to shorten or cancel the break. “What I'm hearing is that we're not here next week. Like, are you kidding me?,” Murphy said. “You have all the evidence you need that Republicans want a shutdown — A, they refuse to negotiate and B, they’re sending us home for the week before the government shuts down. This seems like a planned shutdown as far as I can tell. “There’s zero effort — zero — by Republicans to try to solve this.” House passes billU.S. House Republicans passed the seven-week stopgap government funding bill earlier Friday.The 217-212 vote represents the second time this year the House approved what’s called a continuing resolution on a predominantly party-line vote. Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden was the only member of his party to support the bill. Kentucky Reps. Thomas Massie and Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz were the only Republicans to vote no. House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said the stopgap spending bill is needed to give lawmakers more time to pass the dozen full-year government spending bills and called it the “responsible path.”  “We are certainly moving forward productively and a bipartisan, bicameral agreement is firmly within our grasp,” Cole said. “We just need more time to sustain negotiations and complete our work. That’s why we're here today.”Cole said that not approving a stopgap bill before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1 would lead to a shutdown and hinder those talks.  “Let me be very clear, a shutdown would do nothing to help our work on full-year bills or to support the American people,” Cole said. “So if you want stability for the American people, if you want time to negotiate in good faith and if you want regular order, you’ll support this CR. Any other vote would be reckless, not just for both parties but for the entire nation.” A ‘broken political system’Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the committee, said Republicans’ decision to write the stopgap bill on their own signaled they weren’t actually interested in bipartisanship and that it “reflects a broken political system.” “They would rather shut down the government than sit down and talk with Democrats about lowering costs for millions of Americans, preventing people from getting kicked off their health care and stopping President Trump and budget director Russ Vought from stealing from our communities and from our constituents,” DeLauro. The Trump administration’s unilateral actions on spending, she said, are making work on government funding more complicated, since Democrats cannot trust the White House budget office to implement the laws as written. “This administration continues to freeze, to terminate and cancel $410 billion in commitments to families, to farmers, to children, to small businesses and communities in every part of our country,” DeLauro said. “Billions of these commitments will soon be lost forever if Congress refuses to rein in this administration’s illegal actions.”Republican and Democratic alternativesRepublicans’ 91-page stopgap spending bill would fund the government at current rates through Nov. 21, giving lawmakers more time to complete work on the full-year appropriations bills. That bill, which was released Tuesday, includes $30 million to reimburse local police departments that provide security for lawmakers when they’re back in their home states, $30 million for the U.S. Marshals Service for “Executive Branch protective services"" and $28 million to bolster security for U.S. Supreme Court justices.  Democrats' counter-proposal, released Wednesday, would fund the government through Oct. 31 and permanently extend the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.The legislation would reverse many of the health care proposals Republicans included in their “big, beautiful” law, including substantial changes and funding cuts to Medicaid. Democrats’ 68-page bill would bolster security funding considerably more than the GOP proposals. An additional $30 million would go toward mutual aid agreements with local and state police departments that provide security for members in their home states, $90 million would be provided for House security programs, and $66.5 million for the Senate Sergeant at Arms. There would be an additional $140 million for the federal courts, the Supreme Court, and the U.S. Marshals Service.No negotiationsStopgap spending bills have been a relatively routine and bipartisan part of funding the government for decades, until this year when Republican leaders drafted the legislation on their own.Democrats have said consistently that if GOP leaders don’t work with them to draft a bipartisan stopgap, they cannot expect Democrats to vote for the final product. The stalemate, which has to do with the process as well as significant policy differences, appears likely to lead to the first government shutdown since 2019. A funding lapse this year, however, will impact much larger swaths of the federal government than that 35-day shutdown. When that impasse began, Congress had passed five of the dozen full-year government funding bills, meaning that anyone working for Congress or in the departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Veterans Affairs wasn’t impacted. Lawmakers have yet to pass any of the appropriations bills for the upcoming fiscal year, meaning every department and agency that makes up the federal government will have to decide which employees work without pay and which are furloughed if a shutdown begins. Those plans have been public in the past and appeared on the Office of Management and Budget’s website, but no guidance was posted as of Friday afternoon.  The White House budget office did not respond to a request from States Newsroom about whether it intends to post agency contingency plans.  Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2025-09-19 14:00:15.869437

An additional $30 million would go toward mutual aid agreements with local and state police departments that provide security for members in their home states, $90 million would be provided for House security programs, and $66.5 million for the Senate Sergeant at Arms. There would be an additional $140 million for the federal courts, the Supreme Court, and the U.S. Marshals Service.No negotiationsStopgap spending bills have been a relatively routine and bipartisan part of funding the government for decades, until this year when Republican leaders drafted the legislation on their own.Democrats have said consistently that if GOP leaders don’t work with them to draft a bipartisan stopgap, they cannot expect Democrats to vote for the final product. The stalemate, which has to do with the process as well as significant policy differences, appears likely to lead to the first government shutdown since 2019. A funding lapse this year, however, will impact much larger swaths of the federal government than that 35-day shutdown. When that impasse began, Congress had passed five of the dozen full-year government funding bills, meaning that anyone working for Congress or in the Departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Veterans Affairs wasn’t impacted. Lawmakers have yet to pass any of the appropriations bills for the upcoming fiscal year, meaning every department and agency that makes up the federal government will have to decide which employees work without pay and which are furloughed if a shutdown begins. Those plans have been public in the past and appeared on the Office of Management and Budget’s website, but no guidance was posted as of Friday afternoon.  The White House budget office did not respond to a request from States Newsroom about whether it intends to post agency contingency plans.  Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2025-09-19 10:57:58.666496

Public Utilities Regulatory Authority Chairwoman Marissa Gillett resigned her post as Connecticut’s top utilities regulator on Friday, ending a tumultuous tenure for the agency chair as the state sought to rein in sky-high energy prices.
The decision was announced by Gov. Ned Lamont’s office on Friday. It comes just five months after lawmakers confirmed Gillett to a second 4-year term on the authority that was soon followed by the governor reappointing her as chair.
In a statement, Lamont called Gillett “one of the most experienced and qualified public utility regulators in the country.”
“Her breadth of knowledge, analytical skillset and experience in energy policy, combined with her commitment to fairness and her ability to navigate complex cases were beneficial to our state and ratepayers,” Lamont said. “Marissa brought an outsider’s perspective and a fresh set of eyes to help advance our policy goals of bringing cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable power to the people of our state.”
According to the governor’s office, Gillett’s last day will be Oct. 3.
In her own statement that was shared by the governor’s office, Gillett thanked her colleagues at PURA, where she has served since 2019.
“With the help of PURA’s amazing staff, my fellow commissioners and I have championed an approach that provided rigorous but fair scrutiny to utility rate increase requests and other matters,” Gillett said. “I can confidently say that we fulfilled our statutory mission and held the regulated utilities to a high standard of accountability.”
Gillett had faced mounting scrutiny from both the utility companies and state lawmakers over her management practices, with critics accusing her of wielding unilateral control over the ratemaking process.
At the time of her resignation, Gillett and PURA were facing multiple lawsuits from the state’s two largest utility companies, Eversource and Avangrid, the parent company of United Illuminating.
On Thursday, House Majority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, called for the opening of formal impeachment proceedings against Gillett after the Hartford Courant reported on the existence of emails that he described as evidence Gillett had sought to curtail the authority of her fellow commissioners.
During a confirmation hearing earlier this year, Gillett had denied having any such policy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0220_SR_PuraHearing_105-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 10:57:58.666496

(Screenshot from droughtmonitor.unl.edu)The area of New Hampshire experiencing “extreme drought” conditions tripled over the last week, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
By area, 22.82% of the state was facing extreme drought as of Tuesday, Sept. 16, according to the report, released Sept. 18. That’s up from 7.33% as reported by the drought monitor on Sept. 11. The affected area expanded within Grafton County, dipped further into Merrimack and Sullivan counties, and stretched across Carroll County, also extending into pockets of Coos and Belknap counties.
Extreme drought is characterized by water shortages and increased fire danger, and can be accompanied by widespread crop failure, according to the National Weather Service. Growers across the Northeast are anticipating losses, according to the National Integrated Drought Information System. New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone said the state recommends individuals and municipalities take measures to conserve water.
Even in areas where extreme drought has not been declared, much of the rest of New Hampshire is experiencing drought of lesser severity. About half of the state’s area, including bands above and below the extreme drought zone, are experiencing “severe drought,” while most of the remaining portion of southern New Hampshire is in “moderate drought,” according to the monitor. Another 6.1% of the state’s area, in the southern portion of Hillsborough and Rockingham counties, is considered “abnormally dry.”
Drought conditions in late summer are consistent with a general trend of wetter springs and hotter, drier summers in the Northeast, Stampone said.

He said the Guard can help law enforcement. Others disagree with sending federalized troops to patrol U.S. cities.,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly, a retired Mississippi National Guard officer, is supporting President Donald Trump’s efforts to mobilize National Guard troops to Washington and other cities around the country to crack down on crime. 
Kelly, a Republican who has represented northeast Mississippi in Congress since 2015, said about 200 members of the Mississippi National Guard are still in the nation’s capital, and he believes the troops have sufficient training to aid law enforcement officers in the city. 
“It’s part of our civil response,” Kelly said of the Guard. “We know how to do that mission. They’re not law enforcement. They know what they can and can’t do. They’re supporting law enforcement.” 
The president has threatened to send troops to other cities he believes have problems with violent crime. Opponents of this policy say the use of federal troops for domestic law enforcement violates federal law and usurps individual states’ sovereignty. 
Kelly, a Saltillo resident, first joined the National Guard at the age of 19 in 1985. He mobilized for Operation Desert Storm in 1990 and deployed to Iraq in 2005 and 2009. 
In 2018, Kelly was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In 2020, he was promoted to major general and designated as the state’s assistant adjutant general. Earlier this year, he retired from the Guard. During his tenure in the Guard, he was one of the highest-ranking members of the military serving in Congress. 
He told Mississippi Today in an interview at his Capitol office that he has met with about 15 members of the Mississippi unit in Washington, and all of them said they were enjoying their assignment. 

Rep. Trent Kelly
“They were on their off time,” Kelly said. “They came by, and we gave them a Capitol tour. It was informal.” 
Following the governors of at least three other Republican-led states, Gov. Tate Reeves last month announced he was deploying Mississippi National Guard troops to Washington to bolster Trump’s “effort to return law and order to our nation’s capital.”
The move comes after Trump signed an executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members. Washington’s elected officials and several Democratic lawmakers have disputed these claims, noting that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump’s first term in office. 
After he mobilized the National Guard in Washington, Trump deployed troops to Memphis,  with the support of Tennessee’s Republican governor and U.S. Senators. The president has also suggested sending troops to Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans.
State leaders have speculated whether Reeves or Trump would send Guard troops to deal with crime in Mississippi’s capital city. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a media briefing earlier this month, called Jackson a “Democrat-run city” in a conservative state and labelled it a “sanctuary city.”
“While Jackson is not formally a sanctuary city, the state of Mississippi formally banned sanctuary cities, and this city has acted as a de facto sanctuary city for criminals and illegal aliens since 2017,” Leavitt said. 
But Reeves’ office, in a social media post, said he has not deployed the Guard to Jackson because he has previously worked with the state Legislature to expand the role of the Capitol Police force in the area and has signed legislation into law creating the Capitol Complex Improvement District Court, a state-created inferior court in the state’s capital city.  
“The Governor’s holistic approach to fight crime in Jackson — admittedly using tools not available to the President — is working,” Reeves’ office said. 
U.S. Rep. Mike Ezell, a Republican who represents South Mississippi and a former sheriff, also said the president’s use of the Guard is a “good strategy” because the mere appearance of military members could be a deterrent for crime. 
“I’ll tell you from my own personal experience being a sheriff, being chief of police, if you have a crime problem, and think about what you hear from the police chiefs and the sheriffs,” Ezell said. “‘We don’t have enough manpower. We don’t have enough manpower.’ We hear that. We’ve heard that forever.”
However, not all members of the Mississippi delegation are in favor of the policy. U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the lone Democrat from the Mississippi delegation who represents the Delta, said in an August news release that deploying the Guard was a “power grab” by Trump, “trying to crown himself king.”
“Washington, D.C., needed the National Guard deployed on Jan. 6th, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, but he did nothing,” Thompson said. “Now, Donald Trump has chosen to unleash federal power against a community that didn’t vote for him, proving once again that his priorities are political vengeance and self-promotion.”
While the congressional debate in Congress continues over the policy, the courts are also weighing in. 
A federal judge in California ruled earlier this month that the Trump administration broke the law by deploying National Guard troops in Los Angeles during the summer. The Trump administration is appealing the ruling.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18111710/AP25244526227762.jpg,,,2025-09-19 10:57:58.666496

WILMINGTON—ChristianaCare has become the first health system in Delaware to offer two new FDA-approved, minimally invasive procedures for patients with tricuspid valve disease.
These groundbreaking treatments, TriClip and EVOQUE, can repair or replace a failing tricuspid valve without open-heart surgery, giving patients a safer option and faster recovery.
New options for tricuspid valve regurgitation
The tricuspid valve directs blood flow through the heart, but when it fails to close properly, blood leaks backward — a condition known as tricuspid valve regurgitation. This forces the heart to work harder, often leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling.
“ChristianaCare continues to innovate in the area of non-surgical valve procedures,” said Kirk Garratt, M.D., MSc, medical director of the Center for Heart & Vascular Health. “We now offer every FDA-approved therapy for tricuspid valve disease, which means we can tailor treatment to each patient and choose the option that best fits their condition.”

The new treatments are:

TriClip: A clip attaches to valve flaps that don’t close properly, stopping leaks.
EVOQUE: A replacement valve that uses the patient’s own valve as an anchor to take over function.

“Most of our patients with tricuspid valve disease are older adults, and they really do not desire to travel to Philadelphia for treatment,” said Erin Fender, M.D., interventional cardiologist. “ChristianaCare’s tricuspid valve disease program enables patients to stay in Delaware for treatment and receive this leading-edge care.”
Fender and James Hopkins, M.D., performed ChristianaCare’s first TriClip procedure in August and its first EVOQUE procedure in September.
Both procedures are performed by threading a catheter through a vein in the leg to reach the heart. Guided by echocardiogram, the operation typically lasts one to two hours.
“Patients are usually up and walking later that evening or the next morning, depending on what time of day the procedure was done,” Fender said. “They’re typically discharged the following day.”

In the past, open-heart surgery was the only treatment option, but many patients with severe symptoms weren’t strong candidates.
“When I was a fellow, I did research focused on tricuspid regurgitation at a time when patients really had no therapeutic options,” Fender said. “Now, being able to offer people therapy that’s so safe and effective, with minimal downtime afterwards, is absolutely transformative to our patients. It’s delightful to see the evolution.”

So why do we elect people who are essentially regional correctional commissioners, with voters often having little basis to evaluate whether they're doing a good job or not?","FOR A GUY who holds a fairly obscure elected county office, one that voters have little to no contact with – if they are lucky – Steve Tompkins managed to make himself a remarkably visible player on the political scene. He threw in early with Elizabeth Warren in 2012 as she ran for US Senate and spoke eight years later at her presidential campaign kickoff in 2020. He’s been a prominent ally of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu’s, and once made a run at chairing the Massachusetts Democratic Party.  
While Tompkins has adeptly leveraged his office to forge a deep well of political connections, his resume for the job itself was remarkably thin when Gov. Deval Patrick named him Suffolk County sheriff in 2013 after tapping then-Sheriff Andrea Cabral to serve as his public safety secretary. Tompkins had served as communications chief to Cabral, a college classmate from Boston College, but had no formal background in corrections or law enforcement.  
When Patrick was questioned at the time about the appointment, he said the quiet part out loud about Massachusetts sheriffs, who have responsibility for managing complex county correctional facilities but get the job by political fundraising, campaigning, and winning elections to six-year terms. “It’s a political job, so the folks that are criticizing it as a political hire, tell them: They’re right,” Patrick said after swearing in Tompkins.  
While he may earn points for candor, Patrick’s “political hire” to fill the sheriff’s seat until the next election does not, in hindsight, look like one of his finer personnel picks in the wake of Tompkins’s indictment last month on federal corruption charges.  
Tompkins, who has handily won three election campaigns since his appointment, is charged with extortion involving a cannabis company whose stock he’s alleged to have pressured the firm to sell to him before the business went public. The indictment alleges that he later demanded to be repaid his initial investment, despite the value of the stock falling below his purchase price. The company had a partnership with the sheriff’s office to train released inmates for jobs in the cannabis industry, something key to its licensing under the state law requiring cannabis firms to invest in communities and individuals disproportionately affected by past sanctions against marijuana.  
Tompkins entered a not guilty plea to the charges. He has not commented, but his lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said following Tompkins’s arraignment, “The facts simply will demonstrate that he was charged with a crime he did not commit.”  
Tompkins’s use of the sheriff’s perch as a springboard to affable – and ambitious – player in Democratic politics highlights what Boston College political science professor David Hopkins calls the “odd and vestigial” practice of electing people who are essentially regional correctional commissioners, with voters often having little basis to evaluate whether they’re doing a good job or not.  
The office of sheriff itself is one of the oldest public positions in the Western hemisphere, referenced several times in the Magna Carta of 1215. Sheriffs served as tax collectors and carried out other duties for the British monarch. In the US, the position has become an elected one, with Massachusetts moving from gubernatorial appointment of sheriffs to electing them in 1855.  
While that nominally makes the office more accountable to the public, Mirya Holman, public policy professor at the University of Houston and co-author of a 2024 book on US sheriffs, says the reality often falls short of that ideal.  
“In order for elections to hold people accountable, you have to have competitive elections and voters have to be able to evaluate and compare candidates, which doesn’t happen a lot with sheriffs,” said Holman, who co-authored The Power of the Badge: Sheriffs and Inequality in the United States with Texas Christian University political scientist Emily Farris.  
That’s especially true in Massachusetts, where sheriffs are in charge of county jails and houses of correction but largely have no public patrol function as they do in other states. “It doesn’t seem like voters are deeply aware of what a sheriff does, especially in a place like Massachusetts, where the sheriff is in this hidden office,” said Holman.  
Instead, the sheriff’s post here has often been viewed as a cushy political sinecure, complete with a built-in campaign army of volunteers and donors thanks to corrections staff who are often eager to show loyalty to their boss.   
Tompkins’s focus on the political dimensions of the office was evident from the start, and not always in ways that comported with the law. He was fined $2,500 in 2015 by the State Ethics Commissions for flashing his official ID at store owners and asking them to remove signs for his election opponent in his first campaign to keep the job after his appointment. Two years ago, he was again sanctioned by the Ethics Commission, paying a $12,300 civil penalty for creating a paid position in the sheriff’s department for a niece who handled childcare for him during work hours and for also asking other subordinates to do personal errands.  
Other Massachusetts sheriffs have also not exactly covered themselves in glory lately. Earlier this week, the state campaign finance office said Norfolk County Sheriff Patrick McDermott has agreed to pay the state $36,300 from his personal and campaign funds to settle charges that he unlawfully used thousands of dollars in campaign funds to advance outside businesses he operates. Last September, Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi was arrested for operating under the influence outside the MGM casino in Springfield, where he had driven in a state-owned SUV.  
The election of sheriffs to run local correctional facilities stands in sharp contrast to the operation of state prisons by the Department of Correction, whose commissioner is appointed by the governor and must, under state law, have “at least five years of adult correctional administrative experience.”  
Putting state prisons under the oversight of an appointed official with corrections experience while leaving county facilities to be run by sheriffs who win what are often low-visibility elections is something “we don’t really square,” said Holman. “People who don’t have formal corrections or law enforcement background are in charge of running these facilities. That’s a huge problem in the United States.”  
Which is not to say that there aren’t plenty of sheriffs who bring relevant background to the position and pursue the job professionally and thoughtfully.  
Middlesex County Sheriff Peter Koutoujian, a former legislator and prosecutor, has developed a raft of programs aimed at rehabilitation and successful reentry of inmates. In 2023, he was named national Sheriff of the Year by the Major County Sheriffs of America. Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph MacDonald is also a former prosecutor who has overseen innovative inmate programs during his 20-year tenure, the longest of any of the state’s current 14 sheriffs.  
“I am strongly in favor of having the sheriffs be elected,” said MacDonald, who also taught history and constitutional law and Quincy College prior to winning office in 2004. “If you’re looking for accountability, I think that is the best way. It’s not a perfect way but I think it is the best way. I have a level of faith in the electorate.”  
In the debate over whether sheriffs should be elected or, like the state Department of Correction commissioner, appointed based on their background, MacDonald acknowledged that there are “cogent arguments” on both sides.  
But there is unlikely to be much push for change.  
“Once these offices become elected, they often stay elected regardless of the argument for or value of that,” said Hopkins, the BC political science professor. “Whenever you’ve got these offices that are obscure enough that the average voter doesn’t really grasp what’s going on and figuring out who should hold them is a real challenge, you can make a case that it should not be an elected office. But it’s always a hard sell to tell voters why we should take away their right to choose someone.”  
As for the string of recent events casting sheriffs in a harsh light, though emphasizing that “everyone is cloaked in a presumption of innocence,” MacDonald said, “when these things happen, it damages all of us. In law enforcement, in general, and for sheriffs, in particular, we should be held to a higher standard. People should be able to look at their sheriff and say, this is a guy we trust.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/20231107_125436-scaled-e1699397681810.jpg?fit=1024%2C628&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 10:57:58.666496

(Photo by Michael Theberge/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)A new comparative analysis of states’ religiousness published this week by the Pew Research Center shows Alaska is the 35th most religious state in the country. 
The survey found 26% of Alaskans in Pew’s Religious Landscape Study are considered “highly religious,” based on questions asking whether they believe in God, pray regularly, attend religious services, and consider religion to be important.
The survey, perhaps the highest-quality long-term study of religion in the United States, was conducted in 2023 and 2024, with initial results published in February; Pew released a state-by-state comparison this week.
Chip Rotolo was the main author of the new state-level data analysis. By phone on Wednesday, he said that 40% of Alaskans now say they seldom or never pray.
“That’s up 10 points from 2014 (the most recent prior Pew study). That’s statistically significant. The share of those who say religion is not too important or not at all important, it’s 43%. That’s up 13 points from 10 years ago, so also significant.”
Mississippi was considered the No. 1 most-religious state, with Vermont finishing 51st, last among the states and the District of Columbia.
Among states that voted for Donald Trump in 2024, only Iowa (tied for 43rd) and Nevada (tied for 46th) were less religious than Alaska. 
Alaska was the most religious state bordering the Pacific Ocean. Washington (tied for 37th), Oregon (tied for 46th), California (39rd) and Hawaii (tied for 43rd) are all less religious than Alaska.
Pew previously conducted the Religious Landscape Study in 2014 and 2007, and the results show a downward trend in religiousness within Alaska. In the latest survey, 33% of Alaskans identified as religiously unaffiliated, while 56% said they identified as Christian. In 2014, 62% of respondents identified as Christian and 31% identified as religiously unaffiliated.
Two percent of Alaskans identified as “Pagan or Wiccan,” with 1% identifying as Jewish and 1% identifying as Buddhist, the largest non-Christian religious groups. 
Fifteen percent of respondents identified as Catholic, and 26% as some type of evangelical Protestant.
Nationally, the share of Americans who identify as Christian has dropped since 2007, but the decline leveled off starting in 2020, according to Pew data. In the latest survey, 62% of Americans said they identify as Christian, and 29% identified as unaffiliated.
“Generally,” Rotolo said, “what we see in Alaska parallels very closely what we see at the national level.”
Spirituality — the belief in a soul or spirit — hasn’t declined as much. Eighty-six percent of Alaskans said they believe in a soul. Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas and Virginia, among other states, reported the same level of belief. 
“I think in general, Alaska falls in a pretty similar space on the spiritual measures that it does on the religion (measures), which is … if you broke the United States into thirds, two-thirds would be more spiritual and one-third would be less spiritual,” Rotolo said.
Limited public polling is available on religion in the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau is legally forbidden from asking about religion during the once-per-decade Census and doesn’t regularly ask religion-related questions during the surveys it conducts between Censuses.
The Public Religion Research Institute conducts annual religious censuses down to the county level, but its sample size is smaller than the Pew study and thus has a larger margin of error.
In 2024, its survey — based on just 51 people in Alaska — estimated that 26% of the state had no religious affiliation, below its national average of 28%. 
Its 2023 survey estimated that Anchorage had one of the highest proportions of non-Christian residents anywhere in the country.
Several public opinion survey companies active in Alaska said they don’t typically ask about religion. Data for Progress said it asked about religion in a spring 2024 survey; of 1,120 respondents, 29% said they were not religious and another 12% said “none of the above.” Fifty-two percent of respondents identified themselves as some kind of Christian.
Ivan Moore, who operates Anchorage-based Alaska Survey Research, said he did include questions about religion in a survey conducted this summer.
That survey found 41 percent of respondents identified themselves as atheist, agnostic, or “nothing in particular.” Forty-three percent of respondents said they do not consider themselves actively religious. Approximately one-third of Alaska adults selected a religious affiliation and said they were actively religious, Moore said.
Looking ahead, Rotolo said, he’s interested to know whether there is indeed a revival of religiousness among younger Americans.
“Most of our demographic data suggests we will see more religious decline,” he said, but since the COVID pandemic, the share of Americans who identify as Christian has stabilized.
“That stability story right now is still really interesting,” he said.
Rotolo also noted that historically, “women have been quite a lot more religious than men on all of those core measures we tend to look at.”

As a first-generation college student from a working-class Vermont family, Evan Haley knew college was out of reach without support. Brittany Hamblin was working hard and still falling behind. The Curtis Fund changed that with scholarships to support the education that would set them on a path to success.

In Vermont and across the country, higher education is slipping further out of reach for working-class students. Soaring tuition, shrinking aid, and political attacks on public education are pushing postsecondary education out of reach for many. The Curtis Fund stands in sharp contrast. They don’t just make education accessible; they make it real by providing scholarships for two- and four-year degree programs and short-term, career focused training programs. 

For Evan Haley, The Curtis Fund was the catalyst behind a career built on giving back. A first-generation college student from a working-class Vermont family, Evan knew postsecondary education wasn’t something he could pursue on hope alone. It had to be mapped out, paid for, and within reach. “Unless higher education was a sure thing and a positive return, I could’ve ended up doing something completely different,” he said. “The Curtis Fund made it possible.”


 “I ended up in higher ed because I wanted to help students who were like me,” Evan says.

The opportunity became a launchpad. Evan completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Vermont, graduating without taking on debt thanks to his scholarship, and then earned a master’s in education. Today, he’s giving back to his community, working as Assistant Director for Student Conduct at the University of Vermont, educational and social lead for the university staff union, and a doctoral student in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies.
His decision to stay in-state and serve his community was intentional. “I ended up in higher ed because I wanted to help students who were like me,” Evan says. “That’s why I do what I do.”
But Evan’s story isn’t just about personal achievement. He sees education and access to it as a political act. “There’s a real movement to eliminate or reduce access to higher education. Programs like The Curtis Fund are how we fight back. They keep students enrolled with their renewable scholarships. They keep institutions alive. And they keep the future of change within reach.”
That’s what drives him. “I want to be on every front that matters,” he says. “Now’s not the time to sit back and hope things work out. It’s the time to try everything.”
From union halls to university offices, Evan is shaping systems from both the inside and the outside. And it all started with The Curtis Fund giving him the keys to unlock the gate and the footing to walk through it.
Thanks to wrap-around support and automatically renewable scholarships, Curtis Fund scholars graduate at a significantly higher-than-average rate of almost 90%. “When you support The Curtis Fund, you’re not just backing one student’s degree. You’re fueling a future of impact, leadership, and service to Vermont communities”.
Brittany Hamblin
Brittany Hamblin was doing everything right and still falling behind, but her life changed when she received a Credentials of Value (COV) scholarship from The Curtis Fund. For twelve years, she worked a demanding retail job that left no room to breathe. Her health, her energy, and her sense of self were all on the back burner. Her job gave her a title and a paycheck, though it meant long shifts, missed moments, and a growing sense that something had to change. 

“I felt trapped before. I wouldn’t have been brave enough to make the leap without The Curtis Fund scholarship,” Brittany says.

That’s when Brittany found Stafford Technical Center’s adult education program. The idea of going back to school had always felt out of reach. “I never had loans, but I was afraid of having them,” she said. “It felt like taking out another mortgage, like another weight we couldn’t carry.”
Then, a VSAC counselor awarded Brittany with a Credentials of Value scholarship and cleared the financial barrier that had always stopped her. It gave her a path forward that didn’t require her to sacrifice her family’s stability to build something better. It also allowed her to complete her training without going into debt—something she hadn’t believed was possible.
Brittany enrolled in Stafford’s aesthetics program and started over. Today, she works at Five Elements Salon and Day Spa in Rutland as a licensed esthetician, massage therapist, and assistant manager. She treats clients, manages the front desk, and still gets home in time to tuck her kids in. 
“I felt trapped before. I wouldn’t have been brave enough to make the leap without The Curtis Fund scholarship,” Brittany says. “Now, I’m learning and evolving in a way that lets me care for others and still show up for my family.”
She’s continuing her education, expanding her certifications, and helping the spa grow to meet community needs. “A lot of our clients carry so much. I get to help them feel better—in their skin, in their bodies, in their day. Self-care isn’t always about indulgence. For many of our clients, it’s one of the few moments they get to feel at ease. And I get to be part of that.”

“We were freaking out,” said Stone Child College President Cory Sangrey-Billy.
Montana has seven tribal colleges out of the 35 in the country — the most of any state.
The schools together are estimated to receive $108 million, or roughly double last year’s allocation, said Sangrey-Billy.
“It’s quite a significant jump,” she said.
Now, budget planning is underway at Stone Child in Box Elder and other tribal colleges in Montana.
And tribal education leaders in Montana are touting the results of an economic impact study that shows the federal investment pays dividends to taxpayers.
The report, from the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, said tribal colleges in Montana added $332.2 million in income to the economy in the 2022-2023 fiscal year.
“There is a value to what we bring to the table,” Sangrey-Billy said. “And that’s where we’ve been very successful.”
Based in Alexandria, Virginia, the American Indian Higher Education Consortium has a mission to amplify the voices of tribal-led colleges and universities.
A message on its website said it applauds the Trump administration’s increased investment in Tribal Colleges and Universities.
“This one-time allocation by the federal government for Fiscal Year 2025 is progress towards fulfilling federal trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations as intended and a welcome new precedent in increased investment into TCUs,” the consortium said.
The consortium also said some of the increase comes from dollars that were cut from other federal programs supporting Native American and Alaska Native students at non-tribal colleges.
It encouraged a federal commitment to support all Native students “wherever they pursue post-secondary learning.”

Montana Tribal Colleges and Universities consist of Aaniiih Nakata College on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation; Blackfeet Community College; Chief Dull Knife College on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation; Fort Peck Community College; Little Big Horn College on the Crow Indian Reservation; Stone Child College on the Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation; and Salish Kootenai College on the Flathead Indian Reservation. 

Stone Child does not have the funds in hand yet and is also waiting to see the constraints on spending, Sangrey-Billy said.
She said the money could be allocated for infrastructure, for example — and Stone Child is in need of a new roof. It also could be designated for assessment and education, she said — such as to support student retention by paying for tutors and mentors.
Either way, she said, college leaders are thrilled with the additional money — and pleased to report the return on investment to the community.
The economic impact report, “Building Local Economies of Scale,” measures both the economic impact of tribal colleges in Montana and their returns on investment to students, taxpayers and society.
One of the impacts that resonated with Sangrey-Billy included payroll of $47.1 million — “much of which was spent in the state on groceries, mortgage and rent payments, dining out, and other household expenses,” the report said.
Sangrey-Billy said shopping options are limited near the college on the Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation with 213 enrolled.
“We can only get a few groceries out there so we have to go to Havre (or Great Falls). The economic impact that we have there is big,” she said.
The report also said TCUs generate more in national tax revenue than they receive. It said for every $1 of public money invested in Montana’s tribal colleges, national taxpayers receive $1.40 over the course of a student’s life, and state taxpayers receive $12.40.
It estimated the social benefits to society at $500.8 million through a mix of added student income of $337.1 million, added business income of $135.6 million, and avoided costs of $28.11 million.
Brad Hall, president of Blackfeet Community College in Browning, said tribal colleges are “a good investment,” but changes in the White House can mean changes in objectives.
He said that means tribal college leaders need to educate new administrations about their value. He just returned from Washington, D.C., where he met with federal leaders in education and found them receptive.
“Now that we’re getting to the table and talking more, there’s a willingness to hear what we absolutely need,” Hall said. “A lot of the people we’re working with have never really worked with tribal colleges or were aware of that.”
One issue that’s caused confusion, he said, is that tribal colleges are not DEI programs — the Trump administration has moved to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
Hall said the colleges are tribally chartered campuses in which the federal government has a fiduciary and trust responsibility to help maintain.
“The advocacy just takes time, but I can tell you with certainty we do have our baseline funding, and it’s just that this year was harder to budget for because we didn’t have the certainty that we normally have in budget cycles,” Hall said.
He too pointed to the results of the economic impact study from the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, conducted in partnership with Lightcast. The report said Lightcast provides colleges and universities with labor market data to help create better outcomes for students, businesses and communities.
In Montana, tribal college alumni generated $258.6 million in added income for the state in the 2022-2023 fiscal year, or the equivalent of 4,017 jobs, for instance, the report said.
“We’re not institutions that just take,” Hall said. “We’re institutions that are absolutely vital and contributing to the communities that we serve.”

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Nearly 28% of Michigan students were chronically absent during the 2024-25 school year, the third consecutive year the rate has dropped.
But the rate is still significantly higher than it was before the pandemic began, when 19.7% of students were chronically absent during the 2018-19 school year, according to data released Wednesday by the state Center for Educational Performance and Information.
Chronic absence, which impedes students’ ability to learn and creates instability in the classroom, is a concern in a state where academic performance has been lackluster.
“It’s important for communities to continue to collaborate to emphasize the importance of good attendance and assist children most in need of attendance support,” State Superintendent Michael Rice said in a statement Wednesday.
Students are considered chronically absent in Michigan if they miss 10% of the school year, or roughly 18 or more days in a typical 180-day year.
Michigan had one of the highest rates of chronic absenteeism in the nation at the height of the pandemic, when the rate was 38.5% during the 2021-22 school year. The rate dropped to 30.8% in 2022-23 and 29.5% in 2023-24.
The state’s progress last year was similar to the previous two years, said Jeremy Singer, assistant professor of educational leadership and policy at the University of Michigan-Flint.
Singer, who has conducted extensive research on attendance via Wayne State University’s Detroit Partnership for Education Equity and Research, or Detroit PEER, said that progress still is slower than “we want to see on average.”
“But obviously it’s a good thing to see things moving in the right direction.”



A Chalkbeat analysis of the data found:

263 district and charter schools had chronic absenteeism rates above 36%, which Singer considers “very high.” The average rate among those districts and charters was 51%.
The highest rate of chronic absenteeism, nearly 93%, belongs to Blended Learning Academies Credit Recovery High School, a charter school, which appears to have campuses in Lansing and Livonia..
Nearly half of Black students statewide were chronically absent during the 2024-25 school year, compared to 34% of Hispanic students, 34% of Native American students, 20% of Asian American students, and 21% of white students. The rate for Black students is above the pre-pandemic level of 39% in 2018-19.




Despite the problem, more than half of the school leaders who responded to a statewide survey by researchers at Detroit PEER said they haven’t received any guidance from their districts on how to improve students’ attendance.
Even among those who did receive guidance, just 13% said the guidance was very helpful, Singer said.
“That might be because the guidance is unclear, or maybe it’s because they feel like what is being recommended isn’t working as well as they were hoping.”
Still, simply providing stronger guidance won’t solve the problem, because schools alone can’t solve chronic absenteeism, something Singer and research partner Sarah Winchell Lenhoff, the Detroit PEER director, made clear in a book they released earlier this year.
“I do think clear guidance can help, especially if it helps schools be thoughtful about what strategies they prioritize and how they allocate their resources,” he said..
Detroit PEER sent surveys to around 2,700 school leaders across Michigan. About 41%, or 1,143, replied, giving the researchers a broad look at how schools in the state are addressing chronic absenteeism. The research is ongoing, but initial findings were recently released.
Districts serving impoverished communities have more to overcome
A lack of accessible transportation, parents’ inflexible work schedules, health concerns, and unsafe routes to school have long contributed to high levels of chronic absenteeism in impoverished communities.
The negative effects of the pandemic, which disproportionately hit low-income households, exacerbated existing systemic inequities.
Michigan’s recently released data, however, shows many of the districts with the most to overcome outpaced the rest of the state in improving attendance – like the Detroit school district.
Before the pandemic, the Detroit Public Schools Community District, where 84% of students come from low-income homes, made progress reducing absenteeism with wraparound services for families, hiring attendance agents, and community partnerships.
That momentum was lost in the 2021-22 school year, when the rate of chronic absenteeism shot up to 76.7% in the school system largely due to quarantine rules at the time.
Last year, for the first time, students in the district were chronically absent at a lower rate than in the years preceding the pandemic, the state’s new data shows.
In 2024-25, 60.9% of students in the district missed 10 or more days of school. The rate was 1.2 percentage points lower compared to the 2018-19 school year – the last year before COVID upended in-person instruction.
“Our improvement is rooted in our intentional efforts to expand services to students and families, changing staff mindsets about owning the student attendance improvement process, and increasing family accountability regarding their children’s attendance,” Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told Chalkbeat in an email.
The school system has used a multilayered approach to improve attendance in the years since then , including connecting directly with families to help meet their needs, fostering more partnerships, financial incentives for students, and installing laundry machines at schools, among others.
In the Lansing Public School District, where more than 87% of students are from low-income homes, the absenteeism rate is also now lower than it was before the pandemic. The percentage of kids missing too much school has dramatically decreased from high rates in the early days of COVID.
In the 2021-22 school year, more than 90% of students in the district were chronically absent. Last year, the rate decreased by nearly 38 percentage points.
The district uses a tiered system of support for kids who are at risk of missing too much school with classroom, school, and district-level strategies. The system ranges from informing families on how they can ask for help managing barriers to creating attendance success plans.
Classroom teachers reward students who improve their attendance. At the school level, families of students who are missing three to four days of school a month may get wake-up robo calls as a “friendly nudge.” At the district level, administrators follow-up on referrals to the Office of School Culture’s Attendance Team to set up parent and student meetings.
“We are so proud of our students, families, and educators, who have focused deeply on making every day count and having as many of our students show up to learn,” Benjamin Shuldiner, superintendent of the district, told Chalkbeat in an email.
Some districts improve attendance with mental health supports, accountability
James E. Anderson, superintendent of Wyandotte Public Schools, told Chalkbeat mental health concerns have been the cause of many instances of chronic absenteeism since the pandemic.
“More and more students are having anxiety about something at school,” he said. “It may be peer-to-peer interaction or not wanting to get back into the habit of going to school everyday.”
That aligns with what researchers have learned from the Detroit PEER survey. Researchers provided a list of 33 potential barriers and asked the school leaders to select the top five most common. The survey responses found 43% of school leaders selected mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, as a top barrier.
Chronic absenteeism in the suburban school district jumped to 45.7% in the 2021-22 school year – more than 20 percentage points higher compared to the years before COVID. Last school year, the rate stabilized at 27.8%.
Anderson said the district addresses absenteeism with a simple system.
When students are absent five times, they receive a letter breaking down how many days of school they will miss by the end of the year if they continue missing days at their current rate.
By 10 absences, administrators ask for a meeting with the students’ family to determine what challenges they are facing. The district connects the students with resources based on their needs, such as school or community-based mental health services or arranging transportation, like carpools with neighbors.
At 15 absences, a ticket is issued via a local ordinance. Families must then appear in court to explain why students aren’t getting to school. In some cases, fees are issued.
Statewide survey show schools taking similar approaches
Initial findings from the Detroit PEER research indicate that there is little differentiation between schools in how they’re addressing chronic absenteeism.
“Schools are looking at and are approaching the issue relatively similarly,” Singer said.
Singer said he isn’t sure yet whether that’s a good or a bad thing.
“It worries me a little bit because I think what it communicates is that schools are still trying to figure out how to solve it and so they’re doing a lot of everything.”
The report noted that “the most common practices centered on communication, social-emotional learning, and mental health support” but that “resource-intensive practices like home visits or arranging transportation were less common.”
The least common practices, Singer said, are strategies related to improving conditions within schools so that students have a more positive experience.
“That’s something that’s within the school’s control,” Singer said.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two tax credit program audits were met with skepticism from the Legislative Post Audit committee Tuesday, one because it lacked data about usage and the other about concerns the state will lose as much as $1 billion in income tax in the coming years.
The committee heard presentations about two tax credit programs, the High Performance Incentive Program, or HPIP, and the Kansas Affordable Housing Tax Credit, or KAHTC.
Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, asked for limited-scope audits of both programs, seeking an answer to the total dollar amount of tax credits awarded and how much businesses had used them in the past five years.
 
HPIP uncertainty
The HPIP program uses state income tax credits to encourage businesses to make capital investments, said Josh Luthi, principal auditor for the Legislative Post Audit division.
Luthi reported that data challenges prevented the auditors from tracking the amount of tax credits earned and used. He said three different data sets provided to auditors by the Kansas Department of Revenue were “inconsistent” and varied by millions of dollars.
“For example, for tax year 2019, one data set showed businesses earned about $900 million in HPIP credits credits and used about $90 million,” Luthi said. “The second data set showed businesses earned about $230 million in credits and used about $110 million, and the third data set showed businesses earned about $160 million and used about $100 million.”
Kathleen Smith, with the Kansas Department of Revenue, explained why there were three data sets, one of which included duplication of numbers. She said the revenue department believes the third data set is accurate but has an employee dedicated to going through each file to verify all information is accurate.
They expect to have accurate numbers by January 2026, Smith said.
The data is difficult to track because tax credits may be passed through to shareholders of the company who then claim the credits on their tax returns, or the owner of an LLC may use the tax credits, Luthi said. That requires revenue employees to manually process tax data.
“We do not know how much (earned tax credit) is out there that hasn’t been used,” Luthi said.
In addition to the challenge of transferred credits, Smith noted that the tax credits can be used over 16 years.
The inability to determine how much tax credit was unused concerned legislators.
“This is critical,” Tyson said. “That’s part of the reason I requested the audit is because we really don’t know what we’re handing out on one hand, what the state’s obligated for.”
Smith said she had numbers for 2023 that indicate $154.7 million in tax credits were claimed, and of that, $115.1 million in total credit was allowed.
 
Affordable housing tax credits
The affordable housing program offers tax credits for building units that are rented at specific percentages below market prices in the areas they are built. The developments must remain affordable for 30 years.
The tax credits can be used annually for 10 years, and Luthi submitted a chart that showed how the credits offered each year aggregate over time. For instance, in calendar year 2023, $25.3 million in tax credits would continue through 2033.
Added to that number in 2024 was $30.6 million in tax credits, which would continue through 2034. In 2031 through 2035, Luthi’s chart showed that available tax credits would be $107 million per year.
Luthi’s chart showed that over about 14 years, the program would offer tax credits of just over $1 billion.
Since 2023, $73 million in KAHTC tax credits have been awarded for 67 projects statewide, Luthi said.
Ryan Vincent, executive director of the Kansas Housing Resources Corp., which manages KAHTC, said the program has done what was intended by significantly increasing the number of affordable housing developments statewide.
The state credits combine with federal credits, he said. In 2022, before KAHTC, the federal tax credit funded 491 homes in Kansas. Since then the two tax credit programs have funded 2,123 homes in 2023; 2,435 in 2024; and through August of this year, 1,184 homes, Vincent said.
“Just the development budget of the homes that are already built through this program equals $1.5 billion – with a ‘b’ – across Kansas,” Vincent said. “We don’t give the credits until the housing’s built. Without these credits, the homes wouldn’t have been built without the dollars. Without the credits, the dollars wouldn’t have been spent in your respective communities. These programs generate, or these properties generate, short-term economic development and tax revenues immediately.”
Vincent told legislators that changes last session capped the KAHTC program at $8.8 million of tax credits per year, much less than the $25 million to $30 million awarded in 2023 that 2024. The changes also said the state couldn’t use the $8.8 million to participate in a federal program that used private activity bonds, he said.
Because of those changes, Vincent said development probably wouldn’t continue at the same pace that it has in the last couple of years.
Tyson said she had heard negative feedback from constituents about the program, pointing to a person who told her a house built with tax money was sitting empty and wasn’t needed in their community.
Vincent said housing market studies are done to make sure housing is needed in any area before developments are approved and also said developers wouldn’t invest their dollars in rental properties that they didn’t believe could be rented.
Tyson and other legislators raised concerns about the overall cost of the program.
“We’re talking a billion-dollar giveaway,” Tyson said. “And so what that does is ties our hands for future programs and ties our hands for moving forward with the budget and expenditures. I just would like to keep that in mind. I know you keep saying how wonderful it would be to have the cap removed. You haven’t convinced me yet.”
Vincent disagreed with the term “giveaway.”
“I know how much compliance and how much investment and how much work it is for all the parties. Ultimately, I go to those ribbon cuttings. I walk through those developments,” he said. “I have the conversations with the clerk at the Holiday Inn that used to have to drive two hours into Colby because they weren’t able to find a decent, safe, affordable home. Home matters and home pays big dividends, so I ask that you as policymakers remember that.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P1010246-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-19 09:57:10.133333

Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin during the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954. McCarthy stands before a map which charts what he said was Communist activity in the United States. (Photo by Getty Images)Driven by “a lineup of disgraceful racial bigots and American fascists,” a divisive political crusade by conservatives in the United States was “like a gigantic, tumultuous hurricane” that “dominated the thoughts and actions of the American people, disrupting their emotions, distorting their judgment ….” Those are the words of Michigan Republican Charles E. Potter, a member of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, who, in his 1965 book “Days of Shame,” repudiated the excesses of the McCarthy era.
I read Potter’s 60-year-old mea culpa in David Maraniss’s powerful personal history, “A Good American Family: The Red Scare and My Father,” (Simon & Schuster 2019), which traces the Maraniss family’s harrowing journey to Madison, Wisconsin. The anti-McCarthy Capital Times newspaper saved Maraniss’s dad, Elliott, giving him a job after he was blacklisted and then followed from town to town by federal agents investigating his political activities over “five years, five cities, four kids, eight homes, two papers that fired him, three papers that folded,” as Maraniss writes.
I binge-read the book amid a storm of news as the administration of President Donald Trump ramped up attacks on leftwing activists, Democrats, progressive nonprofits and the media, blaming them for the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, and vowing to attack what White House adviser Stephen Miller called a “vast domestic terror movement,” using the full force of the federal government to “identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks.”
I reached out to Maraniss Thursday in Madison, where the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author grew up and still spends summers. ABC had just indefinitely suspended late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel for criticizing the MAGA movement’s weaponization of the Kirk shooting. And Trump and his FCC chairman were threatening to yank broadcasting licenses from media outlets that criticize the president.
I wanted to ask Maraniss about the parallels he sees between the time he describes so vividly in his book and the current moment.
“There are several obvious haunting similarities,” he told me on the phone, “the demonization of others, the calling of all opponents Marxist or communists or enemies of the state, the gross manipulation of truth, the use of fear to stifle dissent and pressure to silence the media or get the press to go along.”
“Back then,” he added, “most of the press did go along with McCarthy for a long time.”
The Capital Times stood out as an early critic of Wisconsin’s bombastic Red-hunting senator, Joseph McCarthy. Syndicated columnist Drew Pearson was another prominent anti-McCarthy voice, along with Murrey Marder of the Washington Post and Edward R. Murrow — all mentioned in Maraniss’s book. “But you could cite many more that were going along with McCarthyism.”
The main difference Maraniss sees between the McCarthy era and today is that “McCarthy was only a senator, and now we’re dealing with the president, with full control of the levers of power which McCarthy did not have, ranging from the Justice Department to the military.”
McCarthy took aim at major U.S. institutions — from government agencies to  universities to Hollywood to mainline Protestant churches — but he overstepped when began attacking the U.S. Army, infuriating then-President Dwight Eisenhower.
Another glaring difference between then and now, Maraniss added, “is that McCarthy did not have the full support of his own party, the Republican Party.” Today, “almost any Republican who opposed Trump is now no longer in office or in the party.”
It took a long time, however, for mainstream media and mainstream Republicans to turn against McCarthyism and for the public to swing from the distorted thinking former HUAC member Potter finally repudiated to the consensus that leftwing political ideology did not, in fact, pose an existential threat to U.S. national security.
Among the many echoes of Red Scare fever resonating through national politics today is the central issue of race. One of the most gripping scenes in Maraniss’s book is future Detroit Mayor Coleman Young’s testimony before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the Federal Building in Detroit. Young, a World War II veteran, confronts the southern racists on the committee as they question his loyalty, repeatedly correcting their slurring pronunciation of the world “Negro.” Despite the committee’s high-handedness and multiple attempts to silence him, Young has the last word.
“I fought in the last war and I would unhesitatingly take up arms against anybody that attacks this country,” he says. “In the same manner, I am now in the process of fighting against what I consider to be attacks and discrimination against my people. I am fighting against un-American activities such as lynchings and denial of the vote. I am dedicated to that fight and I don’t think I must apologize or explain it to anybody, my position on that.”
Reading about Young and the other brave souls who stood up to McCarthyism, including the elder Maraniss’s lawyer, George Crockett, who was jailed for contempt and returned to continue fighting, is inspiring and thrilling.
In contrast, Maraniss traces the sordid history of U.S. Rep. John Stephens Wood, a Democrat from Georgia and chairman of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan (though he claimed he only went to one meeting). He lays out the evidence that Wood attended the lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish industrialist who was accused of killing of a young, female factory worker in Georgia. Wood was the “wheelman” for Judge Newt Morris, his mentor, helping to collect the body from the lynchers and drive it to the morgue.
White racists, as Potter later acknowledged, played a prominent role in the McCarthy era purges of “un-American” activists. These were the people who sat in judgment of civil rights leaders, Black unionists and activists for racial equality. Maraniss’s father, an antifascist who joined the Communist Party when he was in college at the University of Michigan, led an all-Black battalion in World War II, and dedicated his life to his idealistic view of America, was the target of people who had little respect for equal rights or the Constitution.
Who are the real patriots, Maraniss asks — a question that resonates today.
“Race is at the center of American life, then and now,” Maraniss said on the phone. “And what we’re facing this time is really an attempt to erase the civil rights movement.”
“The chairman of the House un American Activities Committee that went after my father was a Georgia racist who was elected in white-only primaries and opposed every civil rights measure, and he was the one defining what’s an American,” he said. “And you have a similar thing going on now where Charlie Kirk is celebrated on NFL stadium screens and people are being fired left and right, for criticizing someone who disparaged Martin Luther King.”
It’s important not to be cowed by the deliberate use of language as a weapon to promote misunderstanding, he said, “as they have with DEI. I mean, what is on its face wrong with diversity, equity and inclusion, you know? Think about it. I mean, the same thing with being antifascist. I mean, people should embrace those ideas and not run away from them.”
Of his parents, Maraniss writes: “They never betrayed America and loved it no less than the officials who rendered judgment on them in Room 740 of the Federal Building in Detroit. They were dissenters who believed the nation had not lived up to its founding ideals in terms of race and equality, largely because of the reactionary attitudes of self-righteous attackers on the American right.”
The book ends happily. The Maraniss family arrived in Wisconsin in time to watch the Milwaukee Braves play their way to a pennant and eventually beat the Yankees in the World Series. “McCarthy was dead. The Supreme Court had essentially overturned the Smith Act, ruling it was unconstitutional to bring charges against American citizens solely because of their political advocacy. … The world was opening anew.”
But there is, of course, no real end to the struggle. In an epilogue, Maraniss writes about Cap Times reporter John Patrick Hunter, who, long after the Red Scare was safely over,  typed up sections of the preamble to the Declaration of Independence, combined it with a petition listing six of the 10 amendments to the Bill of Rights, along with the Fifteenth Amendment granting Black men the right to vote, then roamed a local park in Madison trying to collect signatures. “He gave the people the nation’s foundational truth and it did not go well,” Maraniss writes. “Of the 112 people he asked to sign the petition. Only one did. Twenty accused him of being a communist.”
“It is an endless struggle,” Maraniss said on the phone. “That’s what life is. And you know, it tends to go in cycles of reaction and counter reaction. This is a very, very difficult one of those cycles. But I’ve been an optimist my whole life. It’s being challenged like never before in my life. My father endured it and came out an optimist anyway, somehow. So to honor my father, I maintain my optimism.”

Instead of a widespread national dialogue on — and spirited defense of — every American’s right to voice their opinion on the complex issues facing the nation, repression and retribution have been leveled against those who didn’t happen to agree with Kirk’s positions.
It’s not something to be taken lightly when “the powers that be” get to decide what words or opinions you get to state or hold.  After all, if there’s one thing everybody has a right to, it’s their own opinion.
Yet, apparently that right ends when and if someone, somewhere, for whatever reason decides to voice their opinion about Kirk and his opinions — which he often encouraged others to challenge with his “prove me wrong” approach to taking questions from attendees at his frequent speaking engagements.
Most of the radical reactions to anyone disagreeing with Kirk’s positions have been targeted at a largely mythical entity called “the left” — as if the only two positions citizens may have in this increasingly divided nation are “the right” or “the left.”
Nothing could be further from the truth.  For most people politics is not the center of their universe, not even close.  In fact, recent polls show most Americans don’t particularly like Republicans or Democrats very much — nor the president, with his approval ratings deeply underwater and nearly two-thirds disapproving of the direction in which his increasingly radical dictates are taking the nation.
Most people — and certainly most Montanans — have lives to lead, jobs to do, families to raise and care for, and bills to pay to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table.  The last thing they’re particularly interested in is wading into the stinking muck of partisan politics, or hating their neighbor because they have differing political opinions.
Yet, every day another story comes out about the firing of more commentators, news reporters, and even comedians who practice the time-honored tradition of making fun of politicians — a rich field to be plowed indeed!
While the vast majority of the free speech retribution has been coming from Republicans over who says what about Kirk, apparently the “you can’t say that” crushing of our First Amendment Right to Free Speech has now been adopted by the Democratic Party in the Big Sky State.
Just this week, following the Democratic Party’s convention, the newly-elected vice chair, Max Johansen, was forced to resign for — of all things — saying something the party poobahs didn’t like about former Montana U.S. Senator Jon Tester.
And what could have been so horrible that Johansen resigned only three days after being duly elected at the convention?  Well, he voiced his opinion that: “I think a lot of people are upset with Tester for not being more proactive and forthright” in his campaign against Tim Sheehy, who beat Tester convincingly.  He also voiced his opinion that Democrats should “stop running away” from the word socialism when it’s “direct aid” helping vulnerable groups.
Apparently Republicans aren’t the only ones censoring opinions they don’t want to hear … or crushing our First Amendment right to Free Speech.
The Democrats could have used the Johansen episode to uphold the value of diverse opinions and the right to voice them in the democracy they repeatedly tell us is so perilously at stake.  They could have said the Democrats are a “big tent” of opinions.  But no, they did just the opposite and condemned Johansen — thus despicably joining the Trumpers in crushing our dwindling right to Free Speech.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/First_Amendment_to_the_U.S._Constitution-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 09:57:10.133333

Rural hospitals across the state — and country — are in trouble, urgently. Labor and supplies are getting more expensive. Federal Medicaid cuts are projected to cut into their revenues. 
And places like Inyo County, on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, face the prospect of having to close key medical facilities.
Southern Inyo Healthcare District, one of two hospitals in the county, had eight days of cash on hand as of Sept.12, the hospital’s chief executive told our Kristen Hwang. Hospitals usually have more than 200 days of cash on hand. 
Local officials have sent a letter requesting an emergency $3 million from Gov. Gavin Newsom to stabilize the facility.

The letter says: “If doors close, thousands of elderly and rural Californians will be left without access to critical healthcare, creating a true medical desert in another region of the state.” 

Here’s Kristen: 
Located in Lone Pine, a town at the base of Mt. Whitney with just 1,300 residents, Southern Inyo Healthcare District is the only hospital within a nearly 60-mile radius. It’s the closest stop for injured hikers and dehydrated tourists visiting Whitney or nearby Death Valley, which regularly receives over 1 million visitors per year. Without it there would be a 136-mile stretch between the next closest hospitals in the eastern Sierra Nevada.
The only hospital in Northern California’s Glenn County said three weeks ago that it would shut down by October.

The obscure court that will now rule on billions of dollars in federal research grants

The Trump administration has eliminated billions of dollars in science grants to universities. 
If the universities want to try to get their research funds back, the Supreme Court says they have to go to an obscure court to do so. Our higher education reporter, Mikhail Zinshteyn, takes a look at that court. 
He writes that the modern Court of Federal Claims, in existence since before the Civil War, was created by the Tucker Act and is the venue for contract disputes with the federal government. For example: a company hired to build a bridge would Uncle Sam if it hadn’t gotten paid. 

David Marcus, UCLA law professor: “I had never spent more than three minutes in class even mentioning the existence of the Tucker Act, and it would never have occurred to me to do so before this spring.”

The Court of Federal Claims was a little-known court until the U.S. Supreme Court said that universities need to file suit there, and not in traditional district courts, to try to have their research grant funding restored. The Trump administration has terminated billions of dollars in science grants.


Following a  complicated Supreme Court ruling in late August, the fate of billions of dollars of science research grants is now at the mercy of an obscure federal law known as the Tucker Act.  
“I had never spent more than three minutes in class even mentioning the existence of the Tucker Act, and it would never have occurred to me to do so before this spring,” said David Marcus, a UCLA professor of law who specializes in civil procedure and federal courts. 
The Tucker Act created the modern version of the Court of Federal Claims, in existence since before the Civil War. Until recently it was the venue for contract disputes with the federal government — think: a company hired to build a bridge sues Uncle Sam over missed pay.
But starting with a surprise, terse order in April followed by a zigzagging set of decisions last month that are stumping lawyers, the Supreme Court basically declared that this little-known court is now the venue for any university or state that wants to dispute the Trump administration’s cancellation of research grants.
The Supreme Court’s April ruling stated that grant disputes should be hashed out in the Court of Federal Claims. The ruling came in a case in which California and other states sought to recover tens of millions of dollars in education funding.Then came the high court’s fractured August ruling, which saw two slim majority rulings in the same case. One was a 5-4 decision siding with Trump that said grant funding has to be settled at the Court of Federal Claims rather than in a traditional district court. The decision could help the Trump administration because it likely requires plaintiffs to seek the restoration of their funding in the Court of Federal Claims and then challenge the legality of the policy behind the grant cancellations in a district court — in effect extra work for researchers and campuses seeking their funding back.But the other 5-4 decision benefitted research universities by indicating that the new federal rules prompting the grant cuts were probably illegal, partially upholding a lower court judge’s order. The case will now proceed in the lower courts.The ambiguity of the “tricky, complicated ruling,” as one legal scholar called it, prolongs the despair of thousands of researchers and graduate students whose life’s work — and a key source of staff income — either remains defunded or is now at risk of being once again terminated. 
Many of the grants were terminated because they ran afoul of Trump’s January executive orders banning so-called Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives.  
“It’s completely foreign to me” that the Court of Federal Claims is “now the place to handle these sort of basic, fundamental questions about the government’s power to handle appropriations,” Marcus said.
It’s not clear if existing grants that were cancelled and then reinstated, such as the hundreds at the National Institutes of Health, will again be defunded. The University of California is the recipient of hundreds of these health science grants. Nationally, the grants paid for research into life-saving drugs, dementia, heart disease in rural areas, robotics education and a whole gamut of science inquiries.
But even before the court’s August ruling, the UC was warning of major slowdowns to its research apparatus. The grant terminations and other funding cuts “have already disrupted the entire biotech research ecosystem at the University of California,” Theresa A. Maldonado, UC’s vice president for research and innovation, told a state legislative hearing in August. In 2024, California programs won more than $5 billion in grants from the NIH and over $1 billion from the National Science Foundation, she told lawmakers. More than 1,000 startups have been founded based on UC patents, she added.CalMatters reached out to the University of California and California Department of Justice about how they interpret the Supreme Court’s split decision and the role of the Court of Federal Claims. California’s attorney general is part of a multistate suit at the center of the Supreme Court’s August ruling. Both agencies are studying the implications of the ruling, spokespersons for each agency said. 
“Cuts to NIH funding risk derailing vital discoveries, disrupting research teams, and undermining economic growth in California and across the country,” UC spokesperson Stett Holbrook told CalMatters in an email. “We are closely assessing the ruling’s impact across UC’s campuses and health systems and will continue to press for full restoration of this essential federal support.”
How we got here
The Supreme Court’s split set of decisions was a response to a June lower court decision in Massachusetts. Judge William G. Young found that the federal government illegally terminated the grants, in large part because the grants weren’t reviewed individually but cancelled en masse. He also said the cancellations were racially motivated and ordered the funding restored. The August Supreme Court decision says that questions about restoring grant funding should go before the Court of Federal Claims.“There is no reasoned decision-making at all” about the NIH’s grant terminations,” Young wrote in his opinion expanding on his June decision. Instead, the cancellations were driven by “sparse pseudo-reasoning, and wholly unsupported statements,” he wrote.Young also faulted the Trump administration for having no definition for what constitutes DEI.Earlier this month Young apologized to the Supreme Court for seemingly misinterpreting its April order in which the justices for the first time said federal grants must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims, The New York Times reported. Young indicated he was unclear on what the high court’s April and September orders meant for other district judges. “I simply did not understand that orders on the emergency docket were precedent,” he said. 
Other jurists said the Supreme Court’s use of the so-called “shadow docket” to issue rulings with little guidance or explanation is confusing. Because of the shadow docket decisions, lower court judges “must grapple with both existing precedent and interim guidance from the Supreme Court that appears to set that precedent aside without much explanation or consensus,” wrote one judge in a September opinion.The April decision commits one sentence to why the Court of Federal Claims is the right venue for government grant disputes. The five-judge majority in August in effect pointed to the April decision to support their ruling. 
Neither the April nor the August Supreme Court rulings “seriously engages with the scope of the Tucker Act and the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction,” Marcus said. “It’s just astonishing.”
Ten of the 21 judges on the Court of Federal Claims were appointed by President Donald Trump, and a majority were appointed by Republican presidents, giving the Trump administration a likely advantage. However, the appeals court overseeing the Court of Federal Claims contains a majority of judges appointed by Democrats. The U.S. Supreme Court can review decisions by the appeals court. 
At least $14 billion in grants affected by ruling
Parts of the Supreme Court decision “raise foundational questions” about grant termination lawsuits in federal district courts, Scott Delaney, a former environmental health research scientist at Harvard University, told CalMatters in an email.“That means that it’ll be much harder (and possibly impossible) to sue to reinstate all NIH and NSF grants that have been terminated, though scientists may still be able to win a court order forcing NIH or NSF to pay their universities the money that the government should have paid them under the grants,” he wrote.
Delaney co-founded Grant Witness, a tool that scours federal datasets to tally which grants the federal government under Trump has terminated or suspended.CalMatters asked him to count how many National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health grants that campuses across the country were fighting to reinstate are now affected by the Supreme Court ruling. The answer?

NIH: 4,044 grants worth $5.7 billion in unspent funds ($12.6 billion in total award value)
NSF: 1,954 grants worth $1 billion in unspent funds ($1.8 billion in estimated total award value)

Delaney said the Supreme Court ruling will likely affect billions of other dollars in grants from other agencies, such as NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency, but Grant Witness isn’t tracking all those yet.
Why Court of Federal Claims may be a challenge for universities 
Marcus said there are probably four reasons universities want to avoid the Court of Federal Claims in their lawsuits  — and these are likely the same reasons why the Trump administration wants them there.
First, some district courts and appeals courts are more likely to include judges whose judicial leanings are more sympathetic to the states and research groups suing the Trump administration. That doesn’t mean just judges appointed by Democrats. Young, the district judge in the National Institutes of Health case, was appointed by Ronald Reagan.
Next, the Court of Federal Claims can award monetary damages, but it cannot make wider rulings, such as halting an agency from continued funding terminations. Those questions would have to go before a traditional district court, so it adds more work for plaintiffs suing the federal government.
Third, the Court of Federal Claims is more limiting in how it allows researchers to join a class action suit. Basically, researchers whose grants were affected by the terminations would have to opt-in by filing paperwork to receive potential financial relief or have their grants restored, Marcus said. That’s different from what occurs in traditional federal courts, where a judge can approve a set of criteria for who is eligible for a class, and then all those eligible people benefit from any decision that awards the class relief. 
But if a university sues, Marcus thinks the process is somewhat easier: The school would just file a complaint with a long list of all the grants or researchers covered in their suit. 
Fourth, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in her dissenting opinion for the Supreme Court noted other possible hardships. Requiring plaintiffs to argue before district courts that the rules terminating their grants are illegal and then separately getting their terminated grants reinstated is “sending plaintiffs on a likely futile, multivenue quest for complete relief,” Jackson wrote.Justice Amy Coney Barrett disagreed in her majority 5-4 opinion. “Vacating the guidance does not reinstate terminated grants,” she wrote, adding that “two-track litigation” in different courts is common. She also addressed Jackson’s criticisms head-on, writing that both district courts and the Court of Federal Claims can separately adjudicate the relief universities or researchers seek.Barrett and Jackson were on the same side in the other 5-4 decision that said Trump’s policies to cut the grants were likely illegal. 
What’s next? 
Marcus cautions that the legal terrain around restoring grants remains an open question. 
But based on his reading of the Supreme Court cases, it is quite possible that the Court of Federal Claims is where scientists will have to try to force the restoration of any terminated funding. And the district court will continue to determine whether the policy behind the grant cuts is legal. It creates a scenario in which the Court of Federal Claims can order funding restored, but until a district court rules on the policy justifying the grant cuts, the federal government can continue to cancel other grants or deny new ones.But Marcus also cites at least one federal judge in California who thinks that individual researchers cannot sue in the Court of Federal Claims because they’re third parties to the contracts; the government technically sent the contracts to the university, not to the researchers. Under that scenario, it may be that individual researchers cannot sue to restore their grants at all and would instead need to rely on their employer to take up the legal fight.  
The equation for universities suing is also nuanced, Marcus said. If a university such as the UC sues to restore funding, there’s a possibility that a district court may rule that funding restoration would have to be heard in the Court of Federal Claims. However, he noted that a federal judge in Massachusetts ordered the Trump administration to restore the $2.2 billion in grants it froze at Harvard University. That judge argued in part that the cuts violated the First Amendment rights of the university. So, even though the case is about money — presumably the domain of the Court of Federal Claims — issues of protected speech belong in a traditional district court.“The resolution of these claims might result in money changing hands, but what is fundamentally at issue is a bedrock constitutional principle rather than the interpretation of contract terms,” the judge, Allison D. Burroughs, wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021822_UCLA_RN_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582
,California,2025-09-19 12:31:00+00:00,CalMatters,Unions are spending more than ever on CalPERS elections. Here’s why they’re divided,Adam Ashton and Jeremia Kimelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/calpers-election-spending/,"California unions are at odds and spending heavily in an election at CalPERS, the pension fund that provides retirement benefits to 2 million people.","In summary
California unions are at odds and spending heavily in an election at CalPERS, the pension fund that provides retirement benefits to 2 million people. 



California’s public employee unions often put up the big money — and the only money — in elections for seats on the board that oversees the state’s largest pension fund. 
This summer, they pulled together $660,000 through an independent expenditure committee to support their favored candidates at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System by sending mailers on their behalf.
But a different vein of money is pouring into the races, and it’s likely to make this the most-expensive CalPERS election ever.
The money is coming from a mix of mostly private sector construction and trade unions that have been urging the $584 billion pension fund to favor union shops in its real estate and construction investments. 
They’re backing incumbent Jose Luis Pacheco, who indicated during board meetings that he’s open to more restrictive labor agreements. Pacheco raised more money in direct contributions than any other CalPERS candidate in history, pulling in $184,000 with more than $54,000 of that coming from construction trade unions.
His is one two seats up for grabs, with voting scheduled to end Sept. 29. Pacheco is defending his seat against Troy Johnson, a challenger with backing from the major public sector unions; and Sam Hassan Akkad, a retired Caltrans engineer.
In the other race, incumbent David Miller, a longtime state government labor leader, is facing Santa Monica firefighter Dominick Bei and retired Pasadena City Manager Steve Mermell. 
“It’s amazing to see this kind of race drawing this kind of money from folks who aren’t part of the system,” said Miller, a two-term incumbent on the CalPERS board who previously was a union leader in the Professional Engineers in California Government and who has benefited from labor spending in his past campaigns. 
About 1.7 million civil servants and retirees are eligible to vote in the election. CalPERS is overseen by a 13-member board. Six are elected by members and seven are either elected officials or are appointed by the governor or Legislature.
Average taxpayers can’t vote, but what happens at CalPERS affects how much money schools, local government agencies and the state can spend on public services. CalPERS is considered underfunded because its assets are worth about 80% of what the system owes over time to its members. It beat its earnings target last year, but when it misses, it charges government agencies more money to make up the difference.
Overly rosy projections in the early 2000s led California to sweeten pensions for its government workers, but then the Great Recession hobbled the fund. It hasn’t clawed out from that one-two punch. 
“CalPERS hasn’t been managed well,”  said Mermell, the former city manager. “California is the 4th largest economy in the world so wouldn’t you think its public pension would be the envy of all the other states? But it’s not. It’s sort of in the middle of the pack.”

‘Money talks’ in pension board election
The dynamics of the race are more complicated than incumbents versus outsiders. 
Incumbent Miller and challenger Johnson are running as a slate. They’re getting a lift from the unions that sent out mailers stressing their bonafides as public sector labor leaders. Their independent expenditure committee was funded primarily by locals from Service Employees International Union and the California School Employees Association.
Incumbent Pacheco and challenger Bei are running on a competing slate, although Bei does not have the kind of direct contributions from trades unions that Pacheco received. They have support from public safety unions as well as watchdog retiree organizations that have been critical of CalPERS’ investment strategies.

Both coalitions — the SEIU-led alliance supporting Miller and Johnson as well as the police and firefighter partnership behind Pacheco and Bei — have produced winning campaigns in the past.
 “it all comes down to who’s voting,” said Johnson, who has worked in California schools for 33 years and participated in his union for more than 20 years.
Mermell and Akkad have less resources, but could find themselves in a runoff. 
“Money talks, I thought that was only in politics, not in something like this,” said Akkad, who has been receiving political text messages from competing CalPERS campaigns. 
“It’s a mess. And I’m glad I’m different from them,” he said. 
Pacheco refused an interview request for this story. Bei said he was unavailable because of work commitments. 
Why the trades are spending on CalPERS
In a twist, the well-funded SEIU coalition behind Miller and Johnson previously supported Pacheco. The same groups in 2021 spent $483,000 through an independent expenditure committee to help him unseat former board member Margaret Brown. 
Johnson, who is a leader in the same public sector union that initially propelled Pacheco, said the California School Employees Association gradually lost trust in Pacheco and chose to break with him. 
Brown now is the president of a group called the Retired Public Employees Association, which has endorsed Bei and Pacheco and purchased campaign signs on their behalf.
Brown four years ago could not keep up with the union spending against her. She raised about $47,000 that year. Pacheco, with help from the trades, has a warchest to reach voters.

 The trades earlier this year sponsored a bill in the Legislature that would have prohibited public pension funds from investing in construction firms that do not adhere to prevailing wage or apprenticeship programs. That effectively would boost trades unions, but would also limit the pension fund’s options when it hires contractors for its $66 billion real estate holdings. The bill did not get a vote in a committee.
The trades also pressed CalPERS to adopt those rules on its own through the fund’s “responsible contractor policy,” which shapes about $1 billion in annual spending.
Reaffirming the policy without additional labor protections “will be a lost opportunity for CalPERS to use its market power to hold employers accountable and uplift the lives of local California construction workers and apprentices,” Jeremy Smith of the State Building and Construction Trades Council told the CalPERS board in March, according to a transcript. 
The vote did not go his way, with seven members affirming the policy without additional labor protections and three voting against it. Pacheco was a no vote. According to the meeting transcript, he said some aspects of the policy “have fallen short, with respect to prevailing wages for instance, the apprenticeship program.”
In a written statement, trades spokesperson Brooke Patton said the unions were supporting Pacheco because he “has shown a strong commitment to protecting their hard-earned retirement savings and has advocated for responsible contractor policies. He has demonstrated genuine respect for working people, and we believe it’s more important than ever to support that leadership.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091725-CalPERS-Election-Signs-MG-CM-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

Trena Turner served on the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2020. She is an ordained minister and the executive pastor of Victory In Praise Church in Stockton.


As a former California redistricting commissioner, I have witnessed firsthand the careful, deliberate and transparent process that drew our congressional lines to reflect the real people of our state. The work was not easy, but it was honorable — and it safeguarded the principle that every community deserves fair representation.
Which is why I am both alarmed and deeply disappointed at the way conversations around Proposition 50, California’s mid-cycle redistricting measure, have often been reduced to a single, shallow question: “What will it cost?”
Yes, this special election carries a financial cost. But if we view it only through dollars and cents, we ignore the greater risks. An estimated 3.4 million Californians stand to lose health care coverage due to Medicaid cuts, and another 3.1 million people — children, veterans and families — face the loss of vital nutrition assistance through SNAP. 
There are measurable consequences of this moment that will reshape the health and stability of our state, while steadily eroding the foundations of our democracy.
We cannot ignore the reality that this year’s map-redrawing in Texas and other states, at President Trump’s urging, has been widely challenged as racial gerrymandering. This continues a generational pattern in many states where lines are drawn to weaken Black, brown, immigrant and working-class voices so politicians can pick their voters.
The Constitution is clear: The role of Congress is to make laws and act as a check and balance to the executive branch. But the Republican-led Congress has failed to fulfill that role. Instead of standing as a safeguard, Congress has abdicated its responsibility and has been a rubber stamp for the president’s unconstitutional whims.
The burden for checking this abuse of power has now shifted to the states and to the people themselves. That is why California must do everything within its power to counter. Midterm redistricting is a moral necessity. We need to pass Prop. 50 and do what we can to hold the line.
The real cost of inaction shows up when children go hungry because their communities are drawn out of political power and their needs are ignored.
The real cost shows up when working families are silenced, while wealthy donors and entrenched politicians redraw maps to protect themselves.
The real cost shows up when generations of struggle for fair representation are erased by a pen stroke that divides neighborhoods and dissolves communities of interest.
And ultimately, the greatest cost is borne by our democracy itself. If we refuse to act because we are afraid of the dollar amount for a special election, then we are complicit in paying a far higher price in human dignity and democratic erosion.
Serving as a redistricting commissioner meant listening to thousands of Californians: parents, farmworkers, business owners, pastors, students, seniors and more. They shared stories of who they are and how their communities function, from the Central Valley to the coast, from urban cities to rural towns.
We honored the state Voting Rights Act, respected communities of interest and built maps in the open for everyone to see. It was democracy in action. It was Californians proving that independent, transparent redistricting is not only possible but necessary.
Now, faced with deliberate racial gerrymandering in other states and unchecked executive overreach at home, California must respond with equal determination.
Democracy is never free. Every generation is asked to invest something in its survival. But the question before us is not whether midterm redistricting is expensive. The question is whether we will further enable the unchecked cost of inhumane laws, unconstitutional abuses and far-reaching executive orders affecting ordinary Californians.
We’ve watched this presidential administration dismantle DEI programs and send the National Guard into our cities under false claims of “rampant crime” — all while cutting the very programs that reduced it. He has targeted and criminalized vulnerable people under the guise of “public safety.”
It is shortsighted for Californians to think only about California at this moment. To stand by and allow more of the same is to surrender to authoritarianism in slow motion. The safeguards we once believed would protect us simply aren’t holding.
Now is not the time for neutrality. If reversing course is what it takes to protect representation, equity and democracy itself, then we must act. 
The price of justice will always be less than the price of injustice. That is the truth we must remember before we decide what “cost” really means. It is why I urge every voting-age Californian to back Prop. 50, so we can temporarily set aside the 2020 congressional maps and do our part to stand against authoritarian overreach.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/081425-Redistricting-Rally-TS-12.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

That's a contested issue in an election for two seats on its board.,"In summary
CalPERS is putting more money in private equity as it seeks higher returns. That’s a contested issue in an election for two seats on its board.


Several candidates for the board of California’s largest public pension fund are complaining that the fund put its thumb on the scale of this month’s election by sending a message to all members before voting concludes.
The message promoted the California Public Employees’ Retirement System’s private equity investments — a contested issue in the election, with several of the candidates criticizing the investments’ associated fees. 
“Regardless of one’s view on private equity, sending such a communication while members are weighing their choices risks giving the appearance that staff are attempting to shape the outcome of an election rather than allowing members to decide for themselves,” candidate Steve Mermell, who is challenging an incumbent, wrote to the board after receiving the message.
CalPERS, a $584 billion pension fund that manages retirement benefits for 2 million people, is overseen by a 13-member board. Its members choose representatives for six of those positions. The other severn are either elected officials or appointees of the governor and Legislature. 
From Aug. 28 through Sept. 29, about 1.7 million CalPERS members are voting on two positions in a testy campaign fueled by public sector union money. 
CalPERS over the past several years ramped up its investments in private equity to $92 billion as it sought higher returns. CalPERS leaders maintain the strategy is working even after subtracting private equity fees.
Last year, CalPERS reported an 11.6% investment return, exceeding its target of 6.8%. This week’s message to CalPERS said, in part, “This strong result – the best in the last four fiscal years – was driven largely by the strength of our private equity investments.”
In an interview last week, CalPERS board member David Miller said, “I would point to private equity as a linchpin of that strategy. People are always saying, ‘CalPERS, use your size, use your size.’ That’s exactly what we’re doing.”
Miller is up for reelection this month. He’s facing Mermell, a retired Pasadena city manager, and Santa Monica firefighter Dom Bei. Bei on social media this week also criticized the timing of CalPERS’ message. 
“Let’s be honest: what they gave us wasn’t perspective at all,” former board member Margaret Brown wrote in a letter to the CalPERS board after the message was released. “It was a glossy narrative declaring private equity is awesome. Real perspective means hearing both sides, the risks and the rewards. What CalPERS gave us was a sales pitch.”
Brown is now a leader in a group called the Retired Public Employees Association, which is supporting Bei. 
CalPERS spokesperson James Scullary in a written statement said the message was tied to a discussion about the fund’s overall performance at its board meeting this week. 
“We know that our members are curious about private equity, so the release was timed to coincide with Monday’s board discussion around our investment returns, the role private equity played, and a proposed shift” to what CalPERS calls a “total portfolio approach.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/031522nCalPERS-MG-CM-09.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) 
About 50 people rallied Thursday outside of the headquarters for the New Mexico Environment Department calling for Secretary James Kenney’s resignation — the latest bout of tensions over proposed changes to regulation of wastewater from oil and gas fields. 
Earlier this year, the state water commission adopted rules to allow for oil and gas wastewater pilot projects, but no discharges into surface or groundwater, a decision seen as a victory for environmental groups.
State water quality board backs off controversial oil and gas project discharges

In June, a new petition requested the 12-member Water Quality Control Commission rewrite its May rule.
The petition was authored by an industry group known as WATR, which stands for Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse (WATR) Alliance, with board members from oil and gas giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum and other industry interests. 
WATR’s proposed rule would allow 13 counties to use “treated produced water” for uses such as watering livestock, “non-food crops,” construction and releases into the environment. Kenney pushed for the petition to move forward. While letters from more than 25 Democratic lawmakers objected to the proposed rule change, the WATR alliance’s position has backing from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who has pushed for using the oil and gas wastewater to address projected water shortfalls.
In August, commissioners — including five cabinet secretaries sitting on the board instead of their designees — voted to override environmental groups’ objections to the petition, and opted to move forward with a hearing on a possible rule change. That hearing has not yet been scheduled.
Amid strong opposition, New Mexico water board lets plan for more oil and gas wastewater use proceed

The Santa Fe New Mexican reported Monday on an emailed exchange in July between staff at the governor’s office and cabinet heads appointed to the Water Quality Control Commission encouraging them to attend the August meeting in-person and get WATR’s petition “over the finish line.” The emails also referenced closed-door meetings about the petition. 
Attendees at Thursday’s protest — which included members of organizations such as Youth United for Climate Crisis Action (YUCCA) New Mexico and parciantes from acequias —said the email exchange amounted to “rigging” the vote at the August meeting. 
“If we allow corruption and lies to stand, we lose more than clean water, we lose the belief that our voices can shape the future,” said Zain Dixon, a YUCCA steering committee member, into a microphone outside the Harold Runnels Building. “We demand accountability. We demand a full investigation into every email, every directive, every backroom conversation, and we demand leaders who serve the people, not the oil and gas industry.”
The governor’s office denied any wrongdoing in a statement to Source NM Thursday. 
“Cabinet secretaries are statutorily required to serve on the commission and have every right to participate directly in important votes. The administration’s position on water reuse has been public for months. Directing secretaries to attend required meetings rather than send staff does not violate any laws,” said Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokesperson for Lujan Grisham’s office, in a statement. “Secretary Kenney has the Governor’s confidence and will continue in his role.”
Kenney responded to Source NM in a statement through an environment department spokesperson. 
“The New Mexico Environment Department respects the right to peaceful protest and public expression on all environmental issues and encourages public participation in our regulatory processes,” said NMED Director of Communications Drew Goretzka. “NMED and Sec. Kenney make science-based decisions and expect the same of the Water Quality Control Commission. The Administration’s position supporting water reuse regulations is outlined in the state’s 50-Year Water Action Plan released in 2024. NMED also has a legal obligation to pass water reuse regulations under the Produced Water Act. NMED technical and legal staff are meeting with WATR to review their petition against our policy and scientific standards.”
The New Mexico oil and gas industry generates billions of gallons of wastewater. The mixture is extremely salty and poses challenges for treatment since it can contain radioactive materials, heavy metals, toxic chemicals and cancer-causing compounds from the oil and gas, such as benzene. Oil and gas companies can use compounds protected as trade secrets in the mixture, which do not have to be disclosed to regulators or the public.

Eleanor Smith, a community organizer with Tó Nizhóní Ání, an organization fighting pollution on the Navajo Nation, drove four hours from her four corners home in Shiprock to attend the protest, saying the issue hits personally, due to the oil and gas development in the San Juan Basin. 
“There is a lot of fracking on sacred lands and no thought for us as people,” Smith said. 
Santiago Maestas, 76, a farmer in Pajarito in the South Valley of Albuquerque, said that while he had not previously participated in the hearings, he believed now the issue was too large to ignore. 
“It’s time that we step forward and resist the contamination in our air, water and in our land,” he said, adding that he had one message to New Mexico’s officials on water saying in Spanish: “Don’t sell it, defend it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Zain-and-Vittoria-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

Guest Commentary written by

Jeanne Raya
Jeanne Raya is the head of an insurance agency and lives in San Gabriel. She was the chair of California’s first independent redistricting commission.


In 2008, the Voters First Act created California’s Citizens Redistricting Commission, an independent body consisting of people who reflected the state’s diversity. Good government groups pushed the ballot measure forward, seeking to make sure voters were — as the law’s name declared — put first. I served on the first commission two years later.
Voter approval of an independent commission effectively ended the backroom partisan gerrymandering that characterized redistricting in California for decades.
Commission members spent nearly a year drawing new maps, giving citizens access to more than 100 public meetings and different ways to submit written comments. Voters could describe their communities, their environment, their infrastructure and their economy. This gave the commission a picture of the whole of California and helped it create districts that gave voters a fair chance at electing accountable representatives.
California’s commission is now considered the gold standard for U.S. redistricting, free of partisan self-interest and conducted fully in public view.
If only Texas could learn from California. There, lawmakers adopted new maps in August in an attempt to rig the 2026 election in favor of Republicans — at the behest of President Donald Trump. Their actions represent the basest motivations of politicians so fearful of losing power, all they can think to do is cheat.
Their determination to stack the congressional deck prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to pursue retaliatory mid-cycle redistricting in California to elect more Democrats. It’s now in the hands of voters in a special election on Nov. 4. Proposition 50 would replace the maps drawn by the state’s independent commission with districts drawn by legislators solely to gain or protect Democratic seats. And that protection will extend through three election cycles.
That is hardly a temporary change.
As a registered Democrat, I would celebrate replacing members of Congress who have forgotten their oath to serve constituents and protect the Constitution. But it can’t be at the expense of California’s Constitution — nor its voters who mandated fair, nonpartisan redistricting.
Newsom said the move by Texas Republicans justifies a retaliatory strike. But we witness daily the chaos and mistrust created by revenge politics in Washington. That is not the model of responsible government Californians deserve. Nor do Californians want to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to gamble that different congressional districts will produce the sought-after change, while real problems remain unaddressed.
No one knows the magic number of blue seats needed to win this electoral war, especially as more red states jump in beside Texas. Is the governor willing to risk losing incumbents in more competitive California districts? Will he accept failure if Democrats fall short nationwide?
This is not an unprecedented moment. We’ve seen for decades how partisan gerrymandering suppresses voters’ choice, undermining trust and feeding cynicism. We know that once given power, politicians will fight to retain it with the confidence that a declaration of crisis is all the cover they need.
Newsom should look for a different response to redistricting warfare.
U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley, for example, proposed legislation to ban mid-decade redistricting nationwide. I don’t know what brought Kiley, a Placer County Republican, to this moment. Perhaps it’s self-preservation under the threat of being gerrymandered out of his seat. But considering a national solution to a national problem would be a welcome undertaking.
Newsom says Democrats can take back Congress if the American people are given a fair chance, a voice and a choice. In California, the people already have that chance, and it’s the independent redistricting commission.
Californians can send a clear message to Newsom and legislative leaders on Nov. 4 to respect the will of the people and not sacrifice the independent redistricting commission, nor the state’s limited financial resources, for short-term political gain.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090625-CA-GOP-OC-JAH-CM-07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

The Boulder […]","Rendering of design plans submitted by Pinkbox in its application to Boulder City Planning Commission.Pinkbox Doughnuts is attempting to open a new shop in Boulder City by the end of the year, but the company’s plans for a pair of poop emoji-shaped mascots in front of the building, and the fact public dollars may fund their creation and installation, is creating quite a stink with local residents.
The Boulder City Planning Commission on Wednesday unanimously denied Pinkbox’s request to feature two 3D freestanding road signs of their pink and brown poop emoji “brand icons.” Pinky and Pooh, as they are known and trademarked by the company, would be outside the entrance and depicted as holding up an existing overhang on the building.
Residents who spoke during the commission’s public hearing opposed the requested zone variance, calling the poop emojis “offensive” and saying they lack class. They argued the figures don’t fit the historic, small-town aesthetic that Boulder City prides itself on.
Pinkbox needs approval from the planning commission because the city ordinances only allow businesses to have one advertising structure along each street frontage.
The poop emojis are considered advertising structures, as opposed to a piece of art that the city has less say in, because they are uniquely identifiable to the company. City staff described them as being more akin to McDonald’s Golden Arches than the generic chef statue or pig illustration featured outside Fox Smokehouse BBQ in Boulder City.
Boulder City code also requires advertising structures to be 100 feet apart, and Pinkbox wants to space Pinky and Pooh and a third, non-controversial doughnut-shaped road sign between 25 and 63 feet apart.
Pinkbox plans to open a location at 849 Nevada Way, at the corner of Elm Street. The property, a former 7-11 convenience store that has been vacant since 2022, is not part of the city’s formal historic district. It is located in what some refer to as the “Motel Sign District,” an unofficial area that features numerous vintage or vintage-inspired signs. Boulder City has previously awarded redevelopment dollars to support sign restoration projects.
The Pinkbox building is already slated to be mostly bright pink and white, with sprinkles on the facade and a doughnut arch entrance. Those features already conform to city ordinances.
Even sans poop emojis, some residents believe Pinkbox will have a negative impact on how Boulder City’s main thoroughfare is perceived by the public.
While Wednesday’s planning commission hearing was focused on the poop emojis, Tara Leon-Bertoli, owner of Boulder City Company Store, told the Nevada Current that local opposition to a Pinkbox in Boulder City goes beyond the gaudy.
In her eyes Pinkbox is a deep-pocketed chain that is “trying to infiltrate” a small town and not invested in truly being part of the community.
“That’s not what we’re all about,” Leon-Bertoli said of Boulder City. “We’re about small business owners who have put everything they have into this one place. Whose kids go to school with everyone, and where the teachers come in. It’s not just about owning property.”
Pinkbox is part of The Siegel Group, a large real estate firm best known for its extended-stay chain Siegel Suites. Amazing Brands, the food and beverage side of the group, operates 14 Pinkbox locations across Nevada and Utah, as well as Siegel’s Bagelmania and Piero’s Italian Cuisine in Las Vegas.
Leon-Bertoli and others are disappointed the Boulder City Council, meeting as the redevelopment board, on Aug. 12 approved Pinkbox for $97,600 in funds to assist in updating the property’s exterior paint, lighting, landscaping and signage. The city’s redevelopment program allows for businesses in the city’s downtown corridor to recoup up to 30% of spending on eligible updates and improvements.
Councilmembers did question whether a Siegel Group company needs any assistance developing a new store. Redevelopment dollars are explicitly designed to support projects where “no other reasonable means of financing is obtainable.”
The city attorney noted that Boulder City PB Holdings LLC, the Siegel affiliate receiving the money, signed an affidavit stating the redevelopment dollars are needed because otherwise they “would not have a reasonable rate of return.” It is by statute an acceptable response, the attorney noted.
Leon-Bertoli remains skeptical.
She also thinks the city needs to focus their efforts on reducing the barriers that stop small entrepreneurs like her from accessing redevelopment dollars. She received funds from the city six years ago to restore to its 1930s style the building that now houses Boulder City Co. Store.
Redevelopment grants are essentially reimbursements, provided only after the restoration or updates have been completed. Smaller businesses have a more difficult time upfronting the costs, she said. The time it takes to get approval can be monthslong.
“Rich companies can afford to wait that long and pay all those bills associated with the purchase of the property until the funding is available,” she said.
Pinkbox’s holding company has been sitting on a separate property — the former Little City Grille — for two years. It purchased the only 7-11 early last year with little public activity until recently.
Leon-Bertoli acknowledges that Boulder City Co. Store, which serves Peet’s Coffee and Carl’s Donuts, would be a direct competitor to Pinkbox. She says she’s “all about healthy competition” but doesn’t see Pinkbox as a healthy addition for her hometown.

After the redevelopment board meeting, Leon-Bertoli hung a sign outside the side of her building that reads “Get Donuts and Coffee on the other side of this pinkbox.” The sign features Boulder City Co. Store’s logo but also a conspicuously bright pink background with sprinkles.
On Thursday, a day after the planning commission hearing, Leon-Bertoli received a cease and desist letter from Pinkbox demanding she take down the sign. The letter, viewed by the Current, accuses Leon-Bertoli of willfully deceptive and illegal trade practices by using trademarked materials and trying to confuse customers.
The letter also alleges Leon-Bertoli made “disparaging, libelous” remarks about Pinkbox, including its trademarked phrase “so good you’ll lick the box.” Leon-Bertoli the night prior told planning commissioners the motto was sexually suggestive and referencing women’s anatomy.
“I don’t know if this town understands that,” she said during the meeting, “but that’s not small-town agenda. I don’t know why they’d think we want that type of humor to grace the downtown corridor.”
Back to the poop emojis
“Just to be clear: These are 10-foot tall, 11-foot wide, 6-foot deep turds,” said Brandon Smith, a homeowner in the historic district who spoke in opposition to the zone variance. “These emojis, they have to go.”
No existing Pinkbox location features the poop emoji mascots as part of their external building design, and their inclusion in the Boulder City design “feels disrespectful,” said Smith.
The mascots, he added, are likely most appealing to young children, something Boulder City is known for having “a dwindling population of.”
Smith and others noted there is an ongoing effort to get the area formally designated as a historic district in its own right.
They argue that existing businesses have signage from, or in line with, Googie architectural style. Known better by sight than by name, Googie style is a futuristic, space-age aesthetic marking the car-centric postwar era of America. The starbursts on the iconic “Welcome to Las Vegas” sign and Stardust resort sign is considered a signature element of the style.
In Boulder City, Southwest Diner, Nevada Inn, Sands Motel, and El Rancho Motel — all located on Nevada Way — have signs in the design style. The vacant Flamingo Inn, which is directly across the street from the planned Pinkbox, also hopes to feature a Googie-style sign.
City Councilman Steve Walton during the August meeting noted the proposed design is “inconsistent” with the area.
“I appreciate corporate logos and marketing,” he said, “but it’s almost like, ‘Hey, I’m going to paint your car pink and I want you to pay for it.’ Like, no thanks.”
City Councilwoman Denise Ashurst also encouraged the company to consider a “more vintage” design.
Planning Commissioner Lorene Krumm on Wednesday noted that, aside from sizing and spacing restrictions, the city does not have requirements related to the aesthetic design of signage, meaning “there will always be those comments and concerns” about businesses not fitting the vibe of the area.
Pinkbox’s representative during the planning commission meeting did not publicly respond to the criticisms lobbied by residents.

At the state’s top air regulator, Lauren Sanchez will replace Liane Randolph, taking the helm as California battles Trump, rising costs, and the future of its climate agenda.


The California Air Resources Board is getting a new leader at a pivotal moment, as it battles the Trump administration in court and contends with growing scrutiny from Democrats and voters questioning the price of the state’s climate principles.
Liane Randolph has chaired the board of the state’s top air and climate regulator since 2020. She oversaw a range of policies including landmark clean-car and truck rules, a fuel standard with implications for gas prices and the state’s signature carbon trading program, cap-and-trade. This week, Gov. Gavin Newsom nominated his senior climate advisor, Lauren Sanchez, to replace her.
Randolph, in an interview, told CalMatters her departure was part of her “personal journey,” something she began considering earlier this year.
“I’ve worked really hard over the last almost five years, and I’m ready for a break,” she said. “I am confident that the transition will go incredibly smoothly.”
Observers say the handover highlights the air board’s key role at a time of political pushback and consumer resistance.
“Pretty much all of the major areas in climate that [the air board] touches are going to be in really significant periods of challenge,” said Danny Cullenward, a climate expert and vice chair of an independent committee that analyzes the cap-and-trade program. “This is not an easy time to take over an agency. It’s a time when sound strategy — and not just autopilot — is going to be required.”
California’s climate ambition meets Trump opposition
Newsom’s 2020 order to phase out gas-car sales by 2035 was a watershed moment for California climate policy. His executive order was a headline-grabbing strike at the oil industry, meant to accelerate not only the state’s adoption of electric cars, but the nation’s.
Newsom said Randolph would be the champion of that effort as his pick to lead the air board just a few months later, calling her “the kind of bold, innovative leader that will lead in our fight against climate change with equity and all California’s communities at heart.”
But Randolph faced a larger challenge than her predecessors: a Trump administration bent on thwarting California’s authority. The White House immediately criticized Newsom’s order as an example of how “extreme the left has become,” evidence that liberal policymakers wanted to “dictate every aspect of every American’s life.”
While Randolph’s air board made significant policy during the years of the Biden administration, Trump attacked those efforts once he returned to office.
“Liane didn’t have the time or the circumstances to pivot toward a new, adjusted strategy,” said Daniel Sperling, a former member of the board, now the director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis. “She inherited the trajectory that California was on, and that the governor was articulating, and then she got undermined by the Trump administration.”
For the gasoline car ban, the air board held months of marathon hearings filled with car owners, environmentalists and industry lobbyists.  In 2022, the board approved the measure that Newsom wanted. More rules soon followed, targeting diesel trucks, locomotives and other major polluters.
Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley, said Randolph steered the  board through a difficult time. 
In disputes involving environmental justice groups, he said, “she really listened to people,” building consensus and lowering tensions. 
“She’s always very diplomatic,” Elkind said. “She was mild-mannered, she wasn’t polemical, she didn’t use it as a perch to pontificate. She seemed very measured and steady and took her role as the public face, and the need for outreach, very seriously.”
Policies moving the state toward zero emissions vehicles have struggled, as federal and state regulators have pulled industry in opposing directions. 
The Biden administration signed off on California’s clean-car rules last year. But the state air board withdrew one of its most aggressive measures on diesel trucks, as well as rules on locomotives, harbor craft and other polluters, in anticipation of Trump’s return.
“There’s not a full understanding of how aggressive the administration’s attacks on all of California’s efforts to achieve climate action have been,” Randolph said at a CalMatters event in San Francisco. She pointed to the Trump administration’s withdrawl of a rule aimed at cleaning up nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.
“That has nothing to do with electric vehicles,” Randolph said. “It was all about just attacking California’s authority, and letting the big companies who supported the administration continue to pollute communities.”
Catherine Reheis-Boyd, a senior advisor to the Western States Petroleum Association, said that under Randolph’s tenure, California’s ambition got ahead of consumers and technology. Her pushback echoed the broader clash with the Trump administration, which has targeted electric cars as costly for consumers and impractical.
“We have no problem with electric vehicles,” Reheis-Boyd said, at the San Francisco CalMatters event. But “we think there should be a free market.”
Searing climate battles at home
Last November, the air board revamped its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a program that uses financial incentives to encourage cleaner fuels as the state phases out gasoline and diesel. 
The fight exposed twin challenges arising from within the state: rising costs and lingering environmental harms not addressed by the climate policy. Consumer advocates raised alarms about gas prices, while environmentalists warned that boosting alternatives like biofuels made from cow manure or soybeans offered limited climate benefits.
Phoebe Seaton, co-director of the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said her group “strongly disagrees” with the expansion of the fuel standard program but credited Randolph’s leadership for showing up and listening to all parties. 
“We are especially grateful for the time Chair Randolph dedicated to meeting in Pixley and Fresno with people impacted by dairies,” Seaton said.

Central valley politicians criticized the program for making fuels less affordable. Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat looking to unseat a moderate Republican in Congress, called for Randolph’s resignation earlier this year. She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard. Her office did not respond to a request from CalMatters for comment.
Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers. While Newsom and the legislature will extend cap-and-trade, the board still must decide how to reshape the program after pausing work on it during the reauthorization fight.
“One of the toughest things about this process is that being really honest about what’s working — and what’s not working — and what the costs of the different options are, is going to be essential,” Cullenward said. “Historically, that’s not something staff have ever embraced.”
Newsom praised Randolph for stepping in during a time of uncertainty and leading with “vision and resolve.” She will leave at the end of the month, before the end of her term, which lasts through 2026.
Questions about costs, affordability and environmental concerns will continue to hang over the air board as it decides how to steer cap-and-trade and other programs in the years ahead.
Randolph, in her remarks Wednesday, said California regulators must get creative in the face of federal attacks, while also addressing public concerns and communicating why the state’s policies matter.
“All of the impacts of climate change make things fundamentally unaffordable,” she said.
Newsom’s point person steps in
Randolph’s replacement, Lauren Sanchez, has been the governor’s point person on climate from within the executive office. Translating Newsom’s vision into state policy at a key turning point while also leading a 16-member board and managing the agency’s vast, highly technical staff will present a new challenge.
Sanchez built her climate credentials on the international stage and inside the governor’s office, where she helped steer billions in budget funding for climate programs and advised Newsom on this summer’s high-stakes energy and climate package.

“He turned to the aide he trusts most on climate,” said Dean Florez, the state Senate appointee to the air board. “Lauren’s been at his side drafting the playbook and steering the billions. This isn’t a change in course, it’s keeping faith with his own circle.”
Before joining Newsom’s office in 2021, Sanchez served as a climate negotiator at the U.S. State Department and later advised John Kerry in the Biden administration. She also held senior roles at the California Environmental Protection Agency and the air board, coordinating climate policy across state agencies and shaping California’s international climate work.
“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said. “She is a force in her own right: her expertise, tenacity, and vision will serve California well as the Board works to protect our communities and defends our climate progress against relentless attacks from Washington.”
Sanchez played a central role in weaving climate priorities into the state budget in recent years, said Jamie Pew, climate policy advisor with NetxGen Policy. Cap-and-trade pays for a climate credit that consumers see on their utility bills; Pew said Sanchez advocated for expanding the credit during the recent legislative negotiations.
“Lauren has been a champion for getting cap and invest done this year, which will ensure that funding for critical climate programs will continue to grow at a time when federal rollbacks threaten the transition,” Pew said.
Next week, the state’s top air and climate regulators will vote on amendments narrowing a previously rescinded truck rule to public fleets. The board is also advancing an emergency regulation to keep its clean-car and truck standards enforceable as the board battles the federal government in court.
Many of the air board’s recent accomplishments have run into roadblocks this year. As expected, Trump quickly moved to block California’s mandates aided by Congress, signing three measures in June against clean cars and two others targeting diesel trucks.
Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)After the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to terminate National Institutes of Health grants addressing diversity, equity and inclusion issues, Utah’s flagship university has reported a loss of about $8.4 million from 13 awards affected by the federal cuts. 
Some of the affected awards were for health-related research, including a project meant to study the genetic diversity of pathogens to help inform the developments of antimicrobials and  vaccines, and a study that aimed to further the understanding of mental health needs of ethnically diverse college students.
Others were programs that provided high school and graduate students to gain experience in research, Julie Kiefer, director of research communications at the University of Utah, said in an email.

“Some researchers have been able to secure temporary funding but will need to identify alternative sources of funding to support their projects over the long-term,” Kiefer wrote. “The student training programs will not be able to continue if funding is not reinstated.”
Those training programs include U of U Step Up, which provides high school students of underrepresented backgrounds with biomedical science research opportunities, and Intermountain PREP, which intends to cover gaps in STEM education for students of diverse backgrounds. They are part of larger national programs managed by NIH, and terminated nationwide, Kiefer said. Currently, there is no indication that funding for these programs will be restored, she said in a statement.
According to Grant Witness, a database recording how the new policy has affected NIH grants, out of the 13 terminated awards, four are listed as possibly reinstated. A researcher on one of those projects confirmed the grant was recently returned, but said it is unclear why.
No other public university in the state was listed in the database, and compared to other states across the country, Utah is listed as moderately impacted by the terminations, way behind states like New York, Illinois, Massachusetts and California, which show the most extensive impacts.
The University of Utah only offered prepared statements after multiple requests for an interview on the status of its NIH grants.
Alzheimer’s research at risk
Jason Shepherd, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Utah’s school of medicine, who spoke to Utah News Dispatch in a personal capacity and not representing the school, said that amid all the federal budget changes, the issue isn’t just the termination of grants, but also the ongoing lack of clarity for future research funding.
Some of his peers have had awards taken away based on keywords used in their proposals, he said. According to The New York Times, federal agencies have flagged a variety of words for review in grant proposals and contracts that could conflict with President Donald Trump’s executive orders limiting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, among others. 
In Shepherd’s case, the issue wasn’t a keyword, but the repercussions of the budget uncertainties that NIH is facing. 
“The NIH is giving out less numbers of grants this year, and there’s just been chaos in terms of what the budget was going to be, what the next year’s budget is going to be,” Shepherd said. “The way the money has been mandated to be spent this year has influenced how many grants can get out.”
One of the projects Shepherd has been trying to fund with NIH awards focuses on studying a mechanism in which Alzheimer’s disease spreads across the brain once patients start to experience memory loss.

“If we could stop that from happening, we could effectively stop the progression of the disease,” he said.
His lab has pursued this investigation for the last five years, testing animal models and post-mortem human brain tissue. 
“In order to lay down the sort of road tracks for drug discovery and making new therapies, this is the work that has to be done,” Shepherd said.
The team receives funding from private foundations like the Alzheimer’s Association, which is keeping the project going for the moment, he said. But, without a long-term NIH grant, the future of the research is becoming more and more uncertain.
“This grant that we applied for is a five-year grant. We would get half a million dollars per year to do the work,” he said. “But without that, I can’t hire anyone to do the work. We can’t pay for the animal facility. We can’t pay for reagents. So basically, it won’t be able to go ahead.”
It’s hard to tell how long it would take Shepherd’s team to develop a drug or therapy for humans, he said. But so far, they have revealed new insights into a disease that has seen little breakthroughs in the last decades.
If the lab isn’t able to secure NIH funding — which in the past he had no issue receiving — he’ll be forced to start laying people off starting next year. On top of that, he worries what this would mean for science and recruiting in research institutions in the country.
“If we’re looking at graduate programs, we’ve always been able to get the best and brightest students in the world, basically because of the science that’s happening in the states,” Shepherd said. “And, University of Utah is doing really well, especially at the medical school, and all of that momentum is now in jeopardy because of what’s happening to the NIH and in general, the sort of anti-immigration viewpoints that are laws that are being put in place.”

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Public Library Service will continue withholding state funding from the Fairhope Public Library amid an ongoing dispute over how the library handles challenges to some books.
Members of the APLS Board Thursday voted to review some of the challenged books and decide for themselves if they meet the APLS’ definition of sexually explicit materials.
The decision was the latest battle in an ongoing fight over books in libraries around the state that conservative groups have claimed are sexually explicit but which opponents say amount to attacks on literature with LGBTQ+ characters or themes.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We are very disappointed that they are putting this off again,” said Randal Wright, chair of the board of trustees for the Fairhope Public Library, in an interview following the decision. “We believe very strongly that we are in compliance, and that the definition of sexually explicit is a subjective thing. You just can’t define it with words; it is emotional as well as objective.”
Representatives from the library addressed APLS board members after the public comment period in the hopes of getting their funding reinstated. Board member Ronald Snider requested the board take a vote to authorize that funding be released, but no one else on the board supported his request.
“I think it is very troubling that we, who espouse small government, are here saying that we are going to decide what is appropriate, that these books are obscene,” Snider said. “What we are doing is listening to a small minority of people in Fairhope who are never going to be satisfied.”
Instead, the board voted for Chair John Wahl’s motion for the Fairhope Public Library to provide APLS with a list of the challenged books, in order for each member to review the materials themselves and decide if they are sexually explicit and should be removed from the teenagers’ section of the library.
“If it is a book that contains sexually explicit content, as defined in the definition created by this board, we want parents to make that call,” Wahl said. “We are not saying the book is bad, we are not saying the book doesn’t have literary value, but what we are saying is that we want parents to make those decisions when it comes to materials that are challenging.”
APLS voted to suspend state aid for the library after some patrons spoke out against the library. The library’s supporters responded by fundraising to help offset the $21,000 in state aid that APLS withheld. The library began to review the books that parents said should not be in the section for minors.
Since the suspension, roughly 10 patrons of the Fairhope Public Library who attended APLS meetings have accused Fairhope Public Library of shelving books they consider sexually explicit, in violation of the administrative code APLS adopted in the summer of 2024, which required libraries to adopt policies that restrict library materials to minors that are “inappropriate for children and youth.” It also prohibits libraries from purchasing such materials and requires advance approval for placing materials on display meant for minors.
Libraries must also have a policy that requires minors to receive permission from their parents before checking out library materials in the adult section.
The APLS board last year approved an update to the administrative code to further define the term “sexually explicit” and include materials with sexual intercourse, sexual excitement, nudity and masturbation.
After the administrative code was adopted, parents told the APLS board that the Fairhope Public Library continued to have books in the minors’ section that are sexually explicit.
Wright said the library completed the review of the books that were challenged and moved seven of the 14 book titles that patrons challenged. Wright said he believed the library complied with the directive from APLS as well as the updated administrative code.
APLS board members and library officials discussed the issue for almost an hour on Thursday.
During the meeting, Wright asked APLS to provide the titles of the books they wanted reshelved and the reason that Fairhope was singled out as the library that had its funding rescinded.
Wahl said there was not a list of specific books that were targeted to be reshelved.
“When you refused parents’ redress or grievance, you left this board with a vote of no choice but to get involved,” Wahl said to Wright. “I think that is what made Fairhope different, was the refusal of giving redress of grievance for parents.”
Wright said the books that parents challenged were reviewed before the administrative code was updated in the summer of 2024, and the director at the time decided to keep the books in the same location.
She then said that the library’s policy was to keep the books that were challenged in place for the next five years, a standard practice for most libraries.
“It wasn’t so much that we were refusing, we were just saying they had already been reviewed,” Wright said. “Fill out an appeal, and we will do it again if we need to because we were willing to talk about it.”
She said that patrons who challenged the books did not approach the library board after that but instead went before the Fairhope City Council and the APLS board.
Prior to requesting that funding for the Fairhope Public Library be restored, Snider said that the APLS board is on a path of censoring library materials. He criticized the decision, saying he believes in local control, and that decisions about library materials should be left to local library boards who oversee the content.
“Is this board going to decide for itself what book in Fairhope, in Birmingham, or Ashland, Alabama, what we think is obscene?” Snider asked facetiously.
Snider then asked if libraries are supposed to remove a book if even one patron challenges its location.
“If it goes against state code, they must,” Wahl said.
Wahl then requested the titles of the books that were challenged and the decisions that the library made about where the books will be placed.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250918_141510-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

The financial crisis at Southern Inyo Healthcare District comes as 


Inyo County, on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, has two hospitals. In a matter of weeks it may be down to one, local and state officials say.
Southern Inyo Healthcare District, a 37-bed hospital in Lone Pine, had eight days of cash on hand as of Sept.12, chief executive Dr. Kevin Flanigan told CalMatters. Local officials have sent a letter asking Gov. Gavin Newsom for an emergency $3 million to stabilize its finances through the end of the year, but absent state intervention the hospital may have to severely cut services and staff — or close altogether.
“If they don’t come through and nobody else comes through then…the board of directors is going to have some very hard decisions to make,” Flanigan said. 
On average, hospitals generally have more than 200 days of cash on hand, according to a recent KFF analysis. Hospitals with less than 80 days of cash on hand are considered “highly vulnerable” to a “financial crisis.”
Located in Lone Pine, a town at the base of Mt. Whitney with just 1,300 residents, Southern Inyo Healthcare District is the only hospital within a nearly 60-mile radius. It’s the closest stop for injured hikers and dehydrated tourists visiting Whitney or nearby Death Valley, which regularly receives over 1 million visitors per year. Without it there would be a 136-mile stretch between the next closest hospitals in the eastern Sierra Nevada.
The hospital’s financial distress comes as rural hospitals across the country face rising costs related to labor and supplies as well as projected future decreases in revenue from federal Medicaid cuts. Three weeks ago Glenn Medical Center, the only hospital in Glenn County in Northern California, said it would shut down by October. 
Assemblymember David Tangipa, Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil, and Inyo County supervisors said in the letter to Newsom that the hospital faces a short-term deficit and a one-time infusion from the state would be enough to stabilize the facility long term.
“If doors close, thousands of elderly and rural Californians will be left without access to critical healthcare, creating a true medical desert in another region of the state,” the letter says. 
Sami Gallegos, a spokesperson for the California Health and Human Services agency, said in a statement that the administration is working with Southern Inyo Healthcare District to expedite payments due to the hospital “where possible.” 
“Our top priority is to ensure Californians in all areas of the state have access to quality, equitable health care,” Gallegos said.
She did not address whether the administration would be able to give the hospital the emergency infusion of cash it has requested.
Hospital struggles to pay bills, employees
During a board meeting Tuesday, Flanigan said the hospital has about $2 million in unpaid bills. Since asking the state for help, the hospital has received about $11,000 in payment owed for medical services.“It’s small stuff, but important,” he said. “It’s helping us make payroll.”
Will Wadelton, the county supervisor for the area that encompasses the hospital, said the county doesn’t have the money to bail the hospital out. 
“We are pursuing all other options to keep the hospital solvent,” Wadelton said, including soliciting donations and hoping for state intervention.

It’s unclear how lawmakers could appropriate money to the hospital quickly. Local officials requested emergency funding on the last regular day of the legislative session, meaning the state’s checkbook can’t be adjusted until lawmakers reconvene in January.
Flanigan said he is still hopeful the hospital will find a solution.
Flanigan, who started the job as CEO just four weeks ago, said the hospital’s dire financial straits had been masked by leftover money from the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time the federal government pumped billions of dollars into health care to help keep hospitals and other facilities afloat while costs rose and other revenue sources declined. State agencies received more than $109 billion in 2021 to support health services while counties and cities got additional money to assist with local response.
Flanigan said emergency funding from the state would give him time to reduce operating costs to a sustainable level and allow the facility to access additional revenue expected in January that would sustain the hospital in the long term. 
“With this funding I would be able to adjust the operations of the hospital without being disruptive and have the highest probability of success,” Flanigan said.
Money from the $50 billion rural health fund included in the Republican “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” to placate conservative lawmakers from rural states would not be available soon enough to help Southern Inyo Healthcare District, he said.
In Northern California, Glenn Medical’s financial difficulties began when the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stripped it of its “critical access” status — a special designation given to qualifying rural hospitals — causing it to lose 40% of its revenue.
Southern Inyo Healthcare District is also a critical access hospital.
“It’s of utmost importance to us to not let another rural hospital close,” said Austin Gilbert, a spokesperson for Tangipa’s office.

They kept their Missouri police licenses and are still working as officers, despite being brought before a state discipline board.
Misconduct is supposed to be reported to the Missouri Department of Public Safety, but sometimes it takes years for that to happen — if it’s ever done. Police department officials aren’t required to report misconduct within a certain amount of time and face no consequences for failing to do so. Missouri isn’t a state that automatically revokes a police license when an officer is convicted of a serious crime.

The Marshall Project – St. Louis reviewed over 600 misconduct allegations vetted by two agencies before going before a state commission. The review unveiled a process that can take years to address a problem and routinely allows officers who have committed serious wrongdoing to keep their jobs. 
The findings raise questions about how effective the state is at rooting out cops who have violated their duties. Many even continue to work while under investigation. 
Police accountability advocates say Missouri’s system undermines public safety and trust.
“The stakes are just too high when it comes to law enforcement and the power that they hold over people’s lives,” said Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project.
Missouri’s police licensing system has loose regulations enforced by a web of agencies. State law also prevents Department of Public Safety officials from disclosing where officers worked in the past. The so-called muni shuffle, when an officer moves around to different municipalities, can be an indicator that they’ve run into trouble in their career.
Z Gorley, a spokesperson for the legal advocacy organization ArchCity Defenders, said they were concerned not only about the potential for officers to switch departments, but also about transparency.
The Missouri Department of Public Safety is responsible for issuing the police licenses required to work as a sworn officer. Its Peace Officer Standards and Training program investigates reports of misconduct. The department’s spokesperson, Mike O’Connell, said anyone can submit a complaint, though most come from police departments. When department officials learn of an incident through news reports, they can also open a case.
If officials determine an officer should face discipline, they then send the case to the Missouri attorney general’s office. Officials there can file a complaint with the Administrative Hearing Commission, which decides if discipline is warranted. If it is, the deputy director can suspend or revoke a license, or place it on probation, O’Connell said.
Missouri Department of Public Safety Director Mark James and officials with the Administrative Hearing Commission declined an interview. The Missouri attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
The Marshall Project – St. Louis analyzed 627 cases handled by the Administrative Hearing Commission dating back to 2014. The analysis identified information, including the nature of the allegation, the approximate length of time between the incident and the beginning of formal proceedings, and the outcome. It took a median of at least 539 days for a complaint to be filed. One officer pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated in 2008, but his case was brought to the commission in 2022. 
That officer’s license is on probation.

In half of the cases involving a death, it took over a year to get a case filed. A complaint was filed three and a half years after former Missouri State Trooper Anthony Piercy handcuffed a man to a boat, who was then ejected and drowned. Conversely, when former St. Louis Police Officer Nathaniel Hendren fatally shot another officer while playing a game, a case was filed five days later.
The commission can also slow the process. A case filed in November 2021 remains unresolved. Sometimes that gives officers the chance to get a new job before they are penalized. 
Of the 627 cases that reached the commission, 73 involved allegations of sexual misconduct. Of those, 33 involved children. A complaint filed last year alleged a former St. Louis police officer forced a 7-year-old girl to have oral sex. Child welfare services substantiated the accusation. An evidentiary hearing on his license is scheduled for Oct. 7. He has since gotten a job with a different department.
Out of the 627 complaints, 135 officers surrendered their licenses and 150 had them revoked. The rest were unresolved, on probation, suspended or expired. In some cases, officers convicted of crimes including fraud and armed bank robbery were allowed to keep their license until it expired.

Even after an officer has been criminally charged, cases fail to reach the commission. 
A glaring example is that of Eric DeValkenaere, a former Kansas City detective who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a 2019 shooting. When his prison sentence was commuted in December 2024, he was still licensed. A department spreadsheet dated June 30 shows DeValkenaere has now surrendered it. Several officers who have appeared in news stories because of criminal charges have not faced formal actions on their licenses. 
O’Connell said the Missouri Department of Public Safety cannot control delays in reporting incidents to the state agency or the pace at which cases move with the attorney general’s office and the commission. Criminal cases also take precedence over licensing. The department has taken steps to strengthen the system, he said, including implementing a program that alerts department officials when an officer is arrested. It doesn’t include officers who attended law enforcement training before 2018. 
Requiring police officials to report misconduct within a certain amount of time is an easy, common-sense solution, said Megan Crane, co-director of the MacArthur Justice Center, a nonprofit civil rights firm.
Carlton Mayers II, an attorney and policing reform expert, suggested instituting automatic decertification for some convictions and allowing the Missouri Department of Public Safety to act independently from the attorney general’s office and the Administrative Hearing Commission.
Other states have strengthened their police licensing oversight structures. In Illinois, officers convicted of felonies and certain misdemeanors automatically lose their license. Following the 2024 fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, Illinois also signed a measure requiring more thorough background checks that include an officer’s performance records and internal investigations. Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New Hampshire have also passed legislation in recent years. In neighboring Kansas, the public has access to a police officer’s employment history, and the state’s Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training has direct authority to revoke a license. 
O’Connell said the Missouri Department of Public Safety has increased its investigators from one to four, and in recent years has “more aggressively sought voluntary peace officer license surrenders,” which resolves cases more quickly than going through the Administrative Hearing Commission.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Melanie_Garcia_STL-OFFICER-MISCONDUCT-DATABASE_header_250909-1024x536.jpg,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

(Photo by John McDonnell/Getty Images)Jimmy Kimmel’s indefinite suspension from his late night television job after a Trump administration official publicly urged ABC and its parent company Disney to “take action on Kimmel” prompted warnings of government censorship from several quarters Thursday, including congressional Democrats, former President Barack Obama, and, closer to home, the ACLU of Nevada, and Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen.
Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, along with the civil liberties nonprofit’s legal director Chris Peterson, took to a social media broadcast Thursday to fold the Kimmel issue into the many recent efforts to chill free speech.
The Nevada organization normally focuses on “dire and grave threats” to the rights of Nevadans, Haseebullah noted, but the network yanking Kimmel from his show after being urged to act by Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr “raises a series of issues.”
The late night host on Monday commented on the Republican response to the death of Republican activist and influencer Charlie Kirk during his opening monologue. 
“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA Gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” he said at the time. 
Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency that regulates various communication platforms like broadcast, told a right-wing commentator that “These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”
Haseebullah said Kimmel’s monologue wasn’t “bombastic” and didn’t use obscene or prohibitive language that could result in an FCC fine.
“He never called for a threat, he never broke a First Amendment rule. He never violated a free speech principle,” he said. “This is basically saying ‘we don’t like what he said, let’s cancel him.’”
After Carr urged ABC to “take action,” Nexstar Media Group, one of the nation’s largest owners or local TV stations, announced its ABC affiliates would be preempting Kimmel’s show “for the foreseeable future.”
ABC subsequently yanked Kimmel from the air.
Nexstar is currently in the process of a $6.2 billion merger with a media company called Tegna, a deal that will require approval from the FCC.
“You have a government official who’s in charge of potentially approving an FCC deal that’s $6 billion,” Haseebullah said, adding the FCC was “potentially shutting down that type of communication by issuing veiled threats.”
Peterson, the legal director for the ACLU of Nevada, said ABC’s decision to pull content wouldn’t normally raise any flags. 
“They’re a private company and they can choose what they want to do,” he said. “But if you start following the links – I don’t think this administration is being subtle about it – back to what’s going on here, where the source was for this pulling, then you start having First Amendment chilling.” 
Democratic U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen sent a letter Thursday asking Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Cruz to hold a hearing to investigate Carr’s “threat to revoke public broadcasting licenses under its public interest authority in order to compel networks to censor programming with which he disagrees.” 
“The government censoring speech it disagrees with is what happens in dictatorships, not democracies,” Rosen, a member of the Commerce Committee, said in a statement announcing the letter. “This isn’t about whether someone likes Jimmy Kimmel’s jokes or not; it is about the fact that every American has the right to speak without government interference.”
The ACLU’s virtual discussion Thursday comes amid a flurry of actions in the aftermath of Kirk’s death that are prompting people to question what qualifies as attacks on free speech.
A number of Nevadans have been dismissed or reprimanded for social media posts about Kirk’s death, raising questions about  whether being terminated or suspended for posting on private social media is a violation of individual rights. 
Not wanting to give specific legal advice, Haseebullah and Peterson spoke more broadly about employee rights to free speech, which they characterized as a gray area that depends on a variety of factors.
Some of the variables include whether an employee works for a private company versus a government entity.
“The ultimate qualifier for all of this is if you’re part of a union, and that union has signed a collective bargaining agreement that includes a portion with respect to speech,” Haseebullah said. 
Peters added in those cases, “go check your contract.”
Censorship and attacks on free speech isn’t anything new, Haseebullah said, noting as an example crackdowns on people protesting against Israel’s actions against the people in Palestine, including blocking food and aid relief to Gaza, as well as Congress continuing to provide billions of dollars in military aid to Israel.
“We know there’s been censorship for a number of years on different issues,” Haseebullah said. “We’ve seen that happening for a while. But since January, it seems like it’s exploded.”
While flying home for the United Kingdom, Donald Trump Thursday praised Carr, and complained about TV network coverage of him and his presidency, saying “maybe their licence should be taken away.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2215644444-scaled-e1758285963569-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

Gavin Newsom approved $750 million in tax credits for Hollywood, he added to $100 billion in annual tax breaks or kickbacks California companies already enjoy.","When Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders were negotiating a final state budget last June, they reduced some health and welfare programs to help close a multi-billion-dollar gap between income and outgo.
Nevertheless, they agreed to more than double the state’s subsidy to Southern California’s film and video industry, which enjoys strong political clout, by setting aside $750 million for tax credits, to induce producers to shoot in California rather than in some other state or country.
“You’ve got to be competitive, and now we’re competitive,” Newsom said as he signed Assembly Bill 1138 at a Burbank studio. “Not to be the cheapest place to do business — that’s never been California’s brand or motto going back a century. We want to be the best place.”
The film and video subsidy is only one way that California’s state and local governments steer money into favored economic sectors or even specific corporations. There are dozens of  “tax expenditures” in the state’s tax systems — so many that the state Department of Finance annually publishes a report on who gets them and how much they cost.
While the budget expands Hollywood’s new tax subsidy, it also tightens up the calculation of corporate income taxes paid by the banking industry. In effect it’s raising taxes on one sector to indirectly pay for lowering them on another.
Overall, California’s tax expenditures reduce revenues by more than $100 billion a year, roughly equivalent to 50% of the state’s general fund budget. Public employee unions and their allies are proposing the state close some corporate tax breaks to reduce its chronic deficit.
At the local level, cities and some counties for decades used redevelopment to encourage investment in neighborhoods deemed to be blighted, redirecting some taxes in the so-called redevelopment zones back into the pockets of developers.
When Jerry Brown returned to the governorship in 2011, he persuaded the Legislature to end redevelopment, thereby shifting more property taxes to school districts, which reduced the state’s financial obligation to schools and helped Brown balance the state budget.
Redevelopment, however, is not the only way local governments, particularly cities, use subsidies to encourage investment on the theory that public coffers will see net revenue benefits.  Another way is to entice businesses that sell taxable goods and services by rebating a share of sales taxes back to sellers.
A new report from the Legislature’s budget analyst details two ways for rebate subsidies to be structured. One involves persuading the owner of a physical store of some kind to relocate from another community. The other is “encouraging retailers to shift the legally-defined place of sale without changing the location of any real economic activity.”
Generally one percentage point of the overall sales tax — which can range from 7.25% to 11.25% of the sale price — returns to the community in which the sale takes place. However, the designated sales point can be manipulated to favor a city that agrees to rebate a share of that tax back to the seller. In an age of decreasing sales in physical stores and increasing Internet sales, designating a point of sale can have major financial consequences.
The report by Seth Kerstein of the Legislative Analyst’s Office calculates that $140 million in rebates flowed from local governments to sellers in the 2023-24 fiscal year, with the largest shares going to Internet sellers and companies that provide fuel to airlines and other transportation entities.
Kerstein could calculate the total because a 2024 law Newsom signed requires disclosure of local rebate agreements. Newsom in 2019 vetoed a bill that would have imposed more restrictions on those agreements.
So are tax rebates just mutually beneficial business deals, unsavory kickbacks or legal extortion? It’s a fine line.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/070225-Newsom-Film-Industry-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

The Alabama Department of Education is considering adding a WorkKeys test as part of its College and Career Readiness Assessments. (File)The Alabama State Department of Education is considering applying for a waiver that would change the way high school students are considered prepared for college and work.
The waiver from the federal Department of Education would ensure career readiness is treated with the same level of importance as college readiness, according to Ann Jackson, chair of the Accountability Work Group, a committee of educators and education representatives across the state who have been meeting to discuss ways to restructure Alabama’s high school accountability measures.
“There seems to be a willingness to look at the current assessments that we are giving nationwide and maybe giving some waivers to some opportunities that may have been on the table before but have not been allowed,” Jackson told state board of education members last week.

Under this new accountability system, all students would still take the ACT, but those who do not show proficiency on the ACT would take the WorkKeys test instead. WorkKeys assesses workforce readiness in applied mathematics, workplace documents and graphic literacy, while the ACT measures college readiness in English, reading science and math.
“Currently, you’re only getting the proficiency piece if they’re ready for college, and we feel like our job is to have them prepared for success, even if that’s going straight into the workforce and that’s what WorkKeys would measure,” said Tony Willis, co-chair of the Accountability Work Group.
District 2 Representative Tracie West had concerns over the WorkKeys test.
“One of the comments I’ve received from the field is that the test may not be as rigorous as it could be for our students to really be prepared if they were going to enter the workforce or if they were going through a dual enrollment program,” West said.
District 1 Representative Jackie Zeigler said the WorkKeys is adequate at helping prepare students for the workforce.
“I’ve been in enough of the parts where they’re doing the welding and that math is very complicated,” Zeigler said. “I needed more of my fingers than I have in a long time. So, I don’t want to diminish the work that our kids going into the career end are not as bright. They are just choosing a different path.”
If Alabama is granted the waiver to do this mixed testing option, it would be the first state to implement it.
“We would be the first state to have a mixed delivery system but there’s about a dozen others that are waiting to see what Alabama does because we were the first state to adopt ACT as our state assessment,” Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey said.
Alabama named ACT as the state assessment in 2014.
Mackey pointed out to the board members that because the waiver requires all students to take the same test, it could result in some students trying on one of the assessments but not the other.
“We used to require the WorkKeys, it wasn’t a part of the accountability, but it was a part of the assessment plan. And we got a lot of pushback that there were a lot of students who had no intention to do anything but go straight to college and that they felt like the WorkKeys wasn’t valuable to them,” Mackey told the board.
High school students would take both tests during their junior year to give the board time to add results to the state report card.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/testing-1024x665.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

(Photo: John Partipilo)A pipeline supplying water from the Cumberland River to the fast-growing Maury and Williamson counties is feasible, but it could cost up to $1.9 billion in 2025 dollars, according to a feasibility study released this week by the Mallory Valley Utility District.
The study examined the projected costs, needs and construction timeline for approximately 30 miles of pipeline that would connect the Harpeth Valley Utilities District, which draws its water from the Cumberland, to the water utility in Columbia by 2033.
The pipeline is one of several pathways under consideration to provide reliable, long-term water supply for southern Middle Tennessee. More than 250,000 residents in the area are currently served by water withdrawn from the Duck River, the most biologically diverse freshwater river in North America. Recent bouts of drought paired with growing water needs for an expanding population and industrial developments are ramping up pressure on the Duck and the dozens of species it supports.
Gov. Bill Lee issued an executive order in November creating the Duck River Watershed Planning Partnership — a panel of state and local officials, utility representatives, and conservation group leaders — to explore ways to balance the river’s preservation and drought management with the region’s increasing water needs.
The partnership met Thursday and is expected to meet again on Nov. 4 before releasing its first interim report on Nov. 20. The partnership’s final report and recommendations are expected in December 2026.
TDEC: $100M Duck River budget ask could be used toward regional Tennessee River pipeline

The feasibility study began in March and was funded by the Mallory Valley Utility District, Maury County Water System, City of Mt. Pleasant Water Department, Columbia Power and Water Systems, and the City of Spring Hill.
Projected costs and hurdles
The study presents estimates for two alternatives: one 54-inch steel pipeline or two 42-inch steel pipelines (which, though more expensive, builds in redundancy in the case of interruptions). The pipeline would require two pump stations capable of moving up to 60 million gallons of water per day.
The pipeline would be built either within or near existing Tennessee Valley Authority property easements. While it would impact around 200 properties, no residents or businesses would be displaced, the study states.
The total estimated cost for the new infrastructure is between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, according to the study. 
The study did not provide specific estimates for the cost of the pipeline to ratepayers. The Harpeth Valley Utilities District, which would treat and deliver water to the pipeline, reported that it was not able to estimate its service charges until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completes its study of the Cumberland River Basin in 2026. 
Operation and maintenance of the pipeline would cost an estimated $6.2 million for the first year of operation if the pipeline initially provided 35 million gallons of water per day. The pipeline would be designed to serve up to 60 million gallons of water per day. 
Depreciation costs, or the amount charged per year to amass funds for eventual replacement, would run between $11.2 million and $17.2 million per year, depending on the pipeline option selected and assumed lifespans of 80 versus 100 years.
The estimated costs, which would be covered by each of the utilities in proportion to their demand, could be decreased if the project’s stakeholders seek state or federal grants.
The study estimates a total cost per thousand gallons at $12.08 “for illustrative purposes only,” assuming that the project costs $2 billion (with a 30-year bond at 3% financing and no state or federal support), serves 35 million gallons each day, and the Harpeth Valley Utilities District’s charges were consistent with their current rates.
For the project to be viable, it would need to obtain authorization from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to withdraw water from the Cumberland River. It would also need to secure permitting approval from the Tennessee Valley Authority, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, USACE, and the Tennessee Department of Transportation.
Funding may be bottom line for Spring Hill
The pipeline proposal is one of several regionalization options under scrutiny. Others include raising the Normandy Dam, increasing intake from the Duck River, or creating a system of reservoirs.
Group seeking to build Columbia Dam on Duck River teams with Ogles to pursue federal funds for study

At a Spring Hill Board of Mayor and Aldermen meeting on Monday, Spring Hill Water General Manager and Assistant City Administrator Dan Allen cautioned city leaders that many conversations will happen in the next few months, and the city’s posture should be one of collaboration to find “environmentally responsible as well as fiscally sustainable solutions.”
 “It certainly appears to be a feasible project in terms of technical feasibility … the challenge that we see is primarily a funding discussion,” Allen said.
Spring Hill, which contributed funding for the feasibility study, would take about 40% to 45% of the water available in the pipeline, and could thus be responsible for the same proportion of costs, he added.
“Even at $1.7 billion, a 40-45% amount of that … I don’t believe is feasible for our ratepayers. This is where you have to start having a conversation about state assistance as well as federal assistance,” Allen said.
Jason Gilliam, one of the leaders of Columbia Dam Now, a group supporting the reconstruction of the dam on the Duck River, called the pipeline project “ridiculous” at the group’s most recent meeting on Tuesday. The cost, he said, would be too high.
The group reported in July that it is working with U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles to secure congressional funding to fast-track a feasibility study for rebuilding the dam. The initial effort to build the dam that started in the 1960s ran into multiple snags ranging from environmental concerns to ballooning costs to permitting issues and a flawed cost-benefit analysis, according to a Congressional report published in 1980. The dam was eventually dismantled.
It’s not clear what the construction of a similar dam would cost in today’s dollars.
In a statement to Tennessee Lookout on Thursday, Gilliam wrote that while the process is slow, there is a “concerted effort” to secure congressional funding for a Columbia Dam feasibility study by the end of the year.

America had done it! Our astronauts were the first to walk on the moon’s surface.
It wasn’t until I was elected to represent Missouri in Congress that I more fully appreciated the generational impact “winning the space race” had on America’s global influence and national security.
Neil Armstrong’s “one small step” highlighted the critical connection between significant advances in science and technology and our national security. Only by harnessing these innovations did we ensure that this new space frontier would be led by Americans instead of the Soviets. In the decades following the moon landing, America enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and national security, which eventually culminated in our victory in the Cold War.
Headlines today echo those in the 1960’s. This time our national security and prosperity are threatened by another global foe — the People’s Republic of China — and they are attempting to harness technological advances to reshape the world in their image.
Instead of space, this new race is taking place in the digital world of artificial intelligence, or AI. Simply put, if we allow China to overtake America as the world’s leader in AI, it could create insecurity for our fellow citizens for decades to come.
What will fuel our nation’s AI dominance is our ability to efficiently and effectively ramp up construction of American data centers, including the massive amounts of energy it takes to run them.
For the past three years, China has invested billions to be an AI superpower in hopes of catching up to the U.S. Consequently, a lack of data center development here in America’s heartland would be a disaster and play right into their hands.
As part of the White House’s American AI Action Plan, President Donald Trump has chartered a course for America to cement our dominance in artificial intelligence. A July executive order will cut federal red tape and streamline permitting to fast-track construction of U.S. data centers.
According to the Trump administration, winning the AI race represents the “cornerstone of innovation, powering a new age of American leadership in science, technology, and global influence.”
Over the next year or two many of the decisions on where this new high-tech industry will invest, create jobs and grow are being made.
Why shouldn’t northeast, central or southeast Missouri play a major role in powering the national AI race?
In addition to a well-trained and eager workforce, the eastern side of the Show-Me State is home to some of the most affordable electricity in the country — including rates 29% lower than the national average.
A proactive effort to site and build data centers will complement the recent push to make the St. Louis region a defense tech hub. The National Geospatial Lab is set to open next year and the White House recently announced that the next-generation F-47 fighter jets will be built in St. Louis by Boeing.
I applaud policymakers in Jefferson City who are doing their part to implement this AI Action Plan here in Missouri.
Gov. Mike Kehoe signed legislation in April that will enable Missouri to generate more home-grown electricity, including next-generation nuclear power. The new state law directs energy producers to create user-friendly policies for large data center customers and ensures that utilities pay their fair share of service costs. This forward-thinking legislation is a strong signal that Missouri is open for business and our grid will continue to have the capacity to serve businesses and homes in our local communities, including data centers.
These efforts have quickly attracted new data center opportunities. In fact, the St. Louis region is on the cusp of being the possible home to several major data centers. These projects would be among the largest construction projects in Missouri’s history, creating jobs and growing our economy. In these scenarios, local communities win because of the significant tax revenues data centers will generate, including millions of dollars in property taxes.
Putting Missouri on the map as a national leader is exciting and important.
But we need to do it strategically ensuring (1) American data centers are sited in appropriate locations and (2) local communities where the centers are located get answers to all legitimate questions about the projects. The recent pause on a St. Charles-area data center was a good example that transparency and communication about these transformational developments cannot be shortchanged.
Winning the AI race against China will not be easy. Many states and locales will allow the forces of status quo and NIMBY to prevail and lose out on these cutting-edge opportunities. But other communities which embrace these high-tech investments are likely to reverse decades of lost manufacturing jobs and witness positive economic and population growth.
Imagine a scenario — in rural Missouri or downtown St. Louis — where the “jobs of the future” exist. Young professionals and jobseekers won’t need to leave Missouri in search of a career but can instead stay, raise families and help their own local communities grow and thrive.
And while all of this is being accomplished at a local level, we have the added significant benefit of enhancing our national security and standing in the world. This is our new moonshot—another “giant leap” for American leadership.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1477933017-scaled-1-e1758208585659-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-19 07:56:13.853743

It spans 468 acres, with the Capitol grounds covering 143 of those. Overall, the complex has 30 buildings, ranging from the domed Legislative Building, where state lawmakers and the governor transact the business of governing, to a licensed childcare center.
There are three gardens, more than a dozen monuments, five parks, plus the Tivoli Fountain. Around 400,000 people visit each year and, as of July, the state Department of Enterprise Services has permitted over 500 events on campus this year. The biggest, Capital Lakefair, attracted 15,000 attendees in July.
While there’s much to keep tabs on, security around the Capitol is increasingly stretched. 
That’s because earlier this year, to help balance the budget, the Legislature and Gov. Bob Ferguson signed off on spending reductions that gutted funding for security staff, including a contract with Washington State Patrol.

PREVIOUSLY: Plan for new juvenile detention center in Pierce County pitched for next WA budget


Looking toward 2026, the agency that oversees the campus is looking to reverse these cuts.
The cuts “effectively eliminated” the Security Operations Center, whose employees work round-the-clock monitoring more than 800 cameras and 1,000 access control points, and the Public Safety Compliance Team, who are trained in crisis de-escalation and the first contact for noncriminal issues. A leaner contract means the state patrol’s visible presence will lessen.
The Department of Enterprise Services wants Ferguson to restore roughly $3 million in funding in the 2026 supplemental budget that he will propose in December.
As is,  this year’s reductions “will leave the campus unprotected and vulnerable outside of normal business hours, including weekends and holidays,” agency officials wrote in their budget request.
The Washington State Patrol, in concert with the public safety team and Security Operations Center services, has been able to “detect criminal behavior before it happens, or early on, and respond to incidents swiftly.”
Without the funding, security operations “would shift from preventative to reactive, meaning law enforcement response would take place after the damage is done to public safety, state employees, or state assets. Lower staffing levels create officer safety concerns, especially during times of civil unrest, contentious situations, or active shooters/threats.”
A 2019 study found Washington had the fewest law enforcement resources in the country for its state capitol complex. And the request notes this year’s cuts come as political activism on the campus is rising.
Permitted and non­permitted events increased 158% in the first six months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, according to the agency. “We expect the number of events and crowd sizes to continue increasing given ongoing federal and global issues,” reads the request.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3557-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 07:56:13.853743

A few times a year, I like to focus on the array of communities, attractions and events the state has to offer. And I have some great ones for you today.
Downtown Nashville has the best fall shopping in the state. (Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The first is Huber’s Orchard and Winery in southern Indiana. I visited for the first time recently and was so impressed with the number of great things to do there. You can pick apples, berries and pumpkins with your kids; grab a tasty slice of pizza; enjoy a scoop of ice cream; or take a tour of the winery and distillery — while getting some free samples.
The farm market has fresh produce and sometimes there is live music on the patio. And there’s a park for kids to run around and play.
Next up, a football game. Obviously, the University of Notre Dame gets a lot of attention, and its campus and facility is full of tradition. Indiana University is also on a roll, so Bloomington would be a good stop. But honestly, any college football game around the state on a perfect fall day is worth your time. And the Indianapolis Colts stadium is also a great stop — though don’t count on the roof being open even on the nicest days.
Brown County State Park is a treasure. Nicknamed the “Little Smokies” because of the area’s resemblance to the Great Smoky Mountains, Brown County encompasses nearly 16,000 acres of rugged hills, ridges, and fog-shrouded ravines, according to the Department of Natural Resources. This is the best place to enjoy fall foliage. Axios Indianapolis reported that leaves in central and southern Indiana will achieve peak fall color between Oct. 21 and Oct. 28. And while you are in Brown County, be sure to do some early Christmas shopping in Nashville — my favorite browsing and buying spot in the state.

My husband introduced me to the Parke County Covered Bridge Festival 20 years ago and I have been going ever since. It runs Oct. 10-19 this year. Everyone knows about the crafts, art, antiques and flea markets in Bridgeton, Rockville and Mansfield. And I enjoy those along with yummy food. But I encourage everyone to explore the festival’s namesakes by picking a bridge route and driving it. The Blue Route is my favorite.
The weekend before that, Oct. 3-5, is another tradition – the Newport Antique Auto Hill Climb. If you like antique cars, it’s the place to be. More than 100,000 people come to see hundreds of automobiles, trucks and motorcycles from the steam, brass, vintage, antique, and classic car eras make timed runs. They go from a standing start up a steep hill to a finish line 1,800 feet away. You don’t want to miss the Sunday finale of the modified division, where I will be rooting on my husband.
No fall calendar would be complete without picking a pumpkin. Every corner of the state has great options for this. Visit Indiana has a fall bucket list with a number of great pumpkin patches no matter where you live.
These are just a few of the ways to celebrate fall this year. I’ll also be buying mums and enjoying time with family around the fire pit. See you there!

Mike Braun's teacher licensure threat goes too far. (Getty Images)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun warned Wednesday that teachers who post online in celebration of political violence could face suspension or even revocation of their professional licenses. But free speech advocates quickly raised concerns that the governor’s threat risks trampling constitutional protections and chilling lawful speech.
“Teachers play a critical role in the shaping of our youth,” Braun wrote in a post to X. “As a result, we hold them to a higher standard. The vast majority of Indiana’s educators live up to that standard; but sadly, in recent days a few have not.”
Braun’s comments followed the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist who was killed at a college speaking event in Utah last week. The Republican governor said disagreement on political issues “should never lead to the type of horrific tragedy we witnessed last week.”

“There have been some terrible things shared, particularly across social media,” Braun wrote, referring to online discourse about Kirk’s death. “While we must protect the First Amendment, calls for political violence are not freedom of speech and should not be tolerated.”
Braun emphasized that Indiana’s Secretary of Education “has the authority to suspend or revoke a license for misconduct and the office will review reported statements of K-12 teachers and administrators who have made statements to celebrate or incite political violence.”
David Keating, president of the Institute for Free Speech, said that threat raises “serious” constitutional concerns. 
“My initial reaction was, I don’t understand why he would call for suspending, like revoking, a teacher’s license,” Keating said. He noted that Indiana law typically ties license revocations to criminal acts or serious misconduct.
State and school officials “would be totally justified, in many situations,” to cancel a teacher’s contract, Keating added, “but I just think it’s a tougher thing to go and revoke a license.”
He also pushed back on Braun’s claim that “calls for political violence are not freedom of speech.” 
“That’s actually not true,” Keating said. “You are allowed to call for violent overthrow of the government. You’re allowed to even call for assassinations. Obviously, this is not the sort of thing that you want an elementary school teacher to have in their background. But I don’t think it meets the standards for a license revocation.”
Licenses under review?
It remains unclear whether any licensure reviews are already underway in Indiana, however. 
The Indiana Department of Education — helmed by Secretary of Education Katie Jenner — “does not comment on open investigations or during the pendency of administrative proceedings,” said agency spokesperson Courtney Bearsch in a Thursday statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
“IDOE is aware of social media comments made by a small number of Indiana educators following the assassination of Charlie Kirk and is reviewing each matter accordingly,” Bearsch said. “These isolated comments do not represent Indiana educators as a whole, the vast majority of which hold themselves to the highest professional standards and work diligently to model good citizenship.”
She explained that — upon being notified of a complaint against an educator — IDOE “investigates to determine whether the facts meet the statutory threshold for suspension or revocation.”
If the facts are “sufficient to satisfy statute,” a formal complaint is then filed with the Office of Administrative Law Proceedings, initiating the administrative process. Under state statute, OALP serves as the final administrative authority in issuing an order on an educator’s license.
IDOE maintains a public database of educators who have been disciplined, most often for criminal convictions. As of Thursday, no license suspensions or revocations had been recorded in the database since Aug. 25.

At least 25 licenses have been revoked since Jan. 1 — most of which were for offenses by educators and school employees who were convicted of one or more of 37 serious felonies that are listed in state statute. Conviction is automatic grounds for a license to be revoked.
Aside from criminal offenses, seven educator licenses were revoked since the start of the year for “immorality” and one for “misconduct,” according to IDOE.
There are more than 230,000 licensed teachers in the state of Indiana.
Stevie Pactor, an attorney with the ACLU of Indiana, warned that Braun’s threat could have broad implications for teachers’ speech.
“Teachers still have First Amendment rights when they’re talking as private citizens about matters of public concern on their social media or anywhere else,” Pactor said. “This idea of chilling their speech is absolutely where my mind went to.”
She pointed to a line from a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which asserted that “The First Amendment needs breathing space to survive.”
“If I were a K-12 educator, I would absolutely be very, very cognizant of what I was putting on social media in this climate, and to a degree that’s not really justified by what the law allows,” Pactor continued. “These posts are clearly their private speech. There’s no question that this is private speech.”
Indiana’s Constitution also has its own speech protections: “No law shall be passed, restraining the free interchange of thought and opinion, or restricting the right to speak, write, or print, freely, on any subject whatever; but for the abuse of that right, every person shall be responsible.”
What the law says — and what’s less clear
Indiana law gives state education officials authority to suspend or revoke a teacher’s license under limited circumstances. 
The Department of Education is permitted by statute to take such action “upon the written recommendation of the state superintendent of public instruction” if a teacher is found guilty of “(1) immorality; (2) misconduct in office; (3) incompetency; or (4) willful neglect of duty.” 
But because “immorality” is not defined in state code, how it applies to off-duty speech — especially speech on personal social media accounts — is open to interpretation, Keating said.
He cautioned that even the governor’s public threat could have consequences. 
“Teachers face this kind of pressure for actually bringing up real issues of public concern,” he said, noting that off-duty speech cases are highly fact-specific and courts have often deferred to school districts. “Taking away their license — I mean, you look at the other standards for taking people’s licenses away. Those are by and large criminal convictions.”

The free speech expert noted, too, that the legal definition of incitement requires more than offensive online rhetoric. 
“Some random person posting on social media — just for whoever out there might or might not be reading it — that’s not incitement,” Keating added, pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court’s Brandenburg test, which limits punishable incitement to speech likely to produce imminent lawless action.
State law also spells out what qualifies as “official misconduct.” According to Indiana Code, a public servant commits official misconduct if they knowingly or intentionally commit an offense while performing their official duties; solicit or accept unauthorized property in connection with their work; misuse nonpublic information for personal gain; or fail to turn over public records or property to a successor. The statute classifies the offense as a Level 6 felony.
Administrative rules also provide more detail on how the license review process works. 
Under Indiana’s Administrative Code, a license suspension can last up to three years, while a revocation can extend for an indeterminate period. A teacher whose license is revoked has the ability to petition for reinstatement after three years.
State officials are required to consider several factors when reviewing a case or a reinstatement petition. 
Those include whether the conduct adversely affected students or colleagues; how long ago the conduct occurred; whether the conduct is likely to recur; and whether denying reinstatement could “chill constitutional rights.” Officials are also directed to weigh evidence of rehabilitation, such as counseling or community service.
Proceedings to suspend or revoke a license are subject to public hearings and can take months or years to resolve.










If I were a K-12 educator, I would absolutely be very, very cognizant of what I was putting on social media in this climate, and to a degree that's not really justified by what the law allows.


– Stevie Pactor, ACLU of Indiana attorney


Pactor underscored that the threshold for punishing speech is high. 
“The school district, in order to prohibit or punish a teacher for their speech, can only do that if that speech would cause a significant disruption to the learning environment or impair the effective operation of the school or the school district,” she said. “And that’s a really high standard.”
She stressed that licensing actions face the same constitutional constraints as school discipline. 
“All government action is subject to the same standard,” Pactor noted. “You know where the First Amendment says you’ve got to stop.”
If the state proceeds with discipline, Pactor said litigation is likely.
“I would certainly expect it to be challenged in court,” she said. “And of course, if any impacted government employee, including educators, believe that their First Amendment rights have been violated in any of these circumstances, they should absolutely contact us.”
A wave of scrutiny
Braun’s threat comes as other educators and public employees have already faced consequences for social media posts about Kirk’s killing.
Indiana’s Department of Child Services, for example, announced via social media on Sept. 13 that a worker was no longer with the agency after making a comment that was in poor taste and “does not reflect the values of this agency or the standards that have been set by this administration.” The agency later confirmed the employee resigned.
Since then, at Ball State University, a director of health promotion and advocacy was fired Wednesday after writing on Facebook that Kirk’s death “is a reflection of the violence, fear and hatred he sowed. It does not excuse his death, AND it’s a sad truth.”

The university said the statement was “inconsistent with the distinctive nature and trust” of her leadership role and had caused “significant disruption” on campus.
Meanwhile, Attorney General Todd Rokita has directed his office to investigate similar statements made by K-12 teachers. His “Eyes on Education” online portal — a site already used to collect complaints about schools — now features a section highlighting social media posts by educators that appear to justify or celebrate Kirk’s death.
Among those listed as of Thursday was a Riley High School teacher in South Bend, who allegedly wrote on Facebook, “I’m not saying it’s right, but I’m saying it’s only fitting.” 
An Elkhart teacher was also flagged, prompting Elkhart Community Schools to circulate a letter reminding staff that online speech can significantly affect how the community views both individuals and the district.
The Indiana State Teachers Association condemned violence but warned Braun’s threat could chill lawful speech. 
“ISTA condemns violence in all forms, including political violence. Indiana’s educators devote their lives to creating safe and welcoming classrooms, and the vast majority do so with professionalism, care and deep commitment to their students every day,” the state’s largest teachers union said in a statement Thursday. “While celebrating violence is unacceptable, threatening educators’ licenses for lawful speech risks silencing those who are teaching honestly or sharing personal views responsibly. … Political violence threatens our democracy, but so does censorship.”

Advoc[...]","The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development headquarters. (Photo by HUD Office of Public Affairs)A federal housing program for families exiting homelessness awarded $5.2 million to a nonprofit Twin Cities housing developer for two projects, but the money never came through. 
Instead, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development rewrote the program guidelines, re-issued the funding application, and gave applicants just one week to re-apply. Advocates sued, arguing that the new guidelines disqualify all projects in jurisdictions with policies — on immigration, homelessness, harm reduction and transgender acceptance — that do not align with Trump administration policy.
A federal judge issued an order temporarily blocking HUD from enforcing the new policies. 
But Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative, a nonprofit developer of permanent supportive housing, says it never received the $5.2 million it was promised.
The situation underscores the whiplash being felt by many organizations, from food banks to child care providers, that have had crucial federal funding withheld since the inauguration of President Donald Trump. 
The money was awarded to two projects that have yet to break ground: Gladstone Crossing in Maplewood, which will create 40 units of supportive housing for families experiencing homelessness; and Aster Commons in Richfield, which will have 38 apartments for young adults who have experienced homelessness, especially those with autism, mental illness or other conditions. 
Supportive housing developments offer deeply affordable — sometimes free — rental housing to people transitioning out of homelessness. They include on-site services, like case management, mental health treatment and job training. Supportive housing is the “invisible backbone of our community solutions on homelessness,” said Chris LaTondresse, president and CEO of Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative.
The Biden administration invested billions into anti-homelessness initiatives — including $175 million in supportive housing development, via HUD’s Continuum of Care program — as pandemic protections for renters expired and homelessness increased. The Biden-led HUD also encouraged the “housing first” approach to homelessness, which does not require sobriety or participation in a substance abuse treatment program as a condition of receiving free or subsidized housing, with the idea that people are more likely to seek treatment — and easier to reach — if they are in stable housing. 
In May, HUD opened up applications for Continuum of Care grants totaling $75 million. Ramsey and Hennepin county offices applied for grants to go towards the two Beacon supportive housing developments. In August, HUD started notifying members of Congress about the grant recipients, according to a complaint filed by the National Alliance to End Homelessness. 
Beacon learned from Sen. Tina Smith that they had been awarded $5.2 million in grants for the two projects.
But HUD never wrote the checks. 
In September, the agency launched a new round of Continuum of Care grant applications, superseding the previous round. It contained a host of new requirements, many of them ideologically aligned with the Trump administration. It also narrowed the focus of the program, requiring projects to be focused on the elderly or people with physical disabilities. 
To receive grants under the rewritten program, projects must be in a city, county and state that prohibit public camping, drug use and squatting and enforces those prohibitions; cooperates with Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and follows certain standards for involuntary commitment. 
It also bars applicants who “deny the sex binary in humans or promote the notion that sex is a chosen or mutable characteristic” and those who “knowingly distribute drug paraphenelia…under the pretext of ‘harm reduction.’”
Minnesota doesn’t qualify under several of the provisions. For instance, Minnesota is a trans refuge state and many local law enforcement jurisdictions do not enforce federal immigration law, which is considered a federal, not a state or local responsibility. 
The department gave applicants one week to submit the new forms.
“Beacon earned this funding through a rigorous, competitive process, and then HUD ripped it away to serve Trump’s agenda. Minnesota families and young people were promised this housing, and now Trump has taken it away from them,” Smith said.
Affordable housing projects are financed through a mishmash of public and private funding sources — tax credits, grants, private donations, lenders, investors — each with its own deadlines and contingencies. Developers have to source funding for both the construction of the project and the ongoing expenses, like operations and maintenance. Continuum of Care grants helped with both. 
When one piece of the funding puzzle falls through, it can throw others into question. 
“The loss of these awards represents a setback for both projects, and we are actively assessing the path forward to closing on both,” LaTrondresse said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/51668526145_e737307647_o-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-09-19 07:56:13.853743

New Jersey health officials have proposed rules to license and regulate facilities that store frozen embryos and eggs. (Photo by Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images)State health officials are moving to regulate egg and embryo storage in New Jersey, an effort to protect frozen reproductive tissues from facility failures that could ruin them.
The state Department of Health has proposed new “biobanking compliance” rules that would require cryopreservation facilities that store eggs and embryos to be licensed and establish standards for premises, equipment, recordkeeping, adverse event reporting, emergency preparedness, and quality management, among other things. Violators would face fines and license suspension, revocation, or renewal refusal.
New Jersey legislators ordered the regulations in a 2019 law in response to catastrophic 2018 failures of such facilities in Ohio and California that resulted in the loss of thousands of embryos and eggs that were stored for people who rely on in vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technology to start or expand their families.
The law, signed in December 2019, was required to be enacted by February 2021. But the pandemic sidetracked health officials and derailed implementation until now, said Claudia Trani-Melgar, a department spokeswoman.
Trani-Melgar said the regulations would ensure such facilities operate safely and effectively, certify that they’re prepared for emergencies and natural disasters, and decrease the likelihood of avoidable equipment failures.
“As a result, individuals and couples that utilize assisted reproductive technology will have greater confidence in the integrity of stored reproductive tissue and its availability for their future use or benefit,” Trani-Melgar said. “We are setting a gold standard that will give families peace of mind and serve as a model for states across the country.”
The rulemaking comes as states around the country are scrambling to regulate in this space, with the Trump administration increasingly restricting reproductive rights, said Jessie Losch, director of government affairs for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
In February, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to expand access to in vitro fertilization and gave White House officials 90 days to draft policy recommendations. But the administration has since backpedaled and seemingly abandoned the issue.
Still, that order created uncertainty and further fueled the “personhood” movement, presenting new challenges for embryo storage facilities and IVF providers, Losch noted.
Policymakers on all sides of the issue have acted. At least 17 states now have protections in place establishing fetal rights, according to the nonprofit Pregnancy Justice. Democratic-leaning states, including Rhode Island and Colorado, have followed New Jersey’s lead and are considering or have passed laws to license and regulate facilities that handle embryos, Losch said. Other states are eyeing regulations on everything from how frozen embryos should be disposed of to how long they can be stored.
Embryo and egg storage is already subject to several layers of federal oversight by agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Losch said. But she welcomed state oversight too, at least now.
“We tend to say more regulation is not needed as long as you’re in compliance with existing regulations, but I think a lot of norms have flown out the window,” Losch said.
State policymakers likely will have to consider the interstate implications of egg and embryo storage too, much as New Jersey legislators acted to protect patients and providers from criminal and civil liability for getting or performing abortions in states where the procedure is restricted, Losch said.
“They may look at our existing shield law to see how that can protect shipping embryos or gametes into and out of the state,” she said. “Where states are trying to protect access (to reproductive rights), New Jersey has been leading the way.”
The Department of Health is accepting written public comment on the proposed rules on egg and embryo storage until Nov. 14. Comments can be filed online or by mail to Kimberly E. Jenkins, director of the Office of Legal and Regulatory Compliance, New Jersey Department of Health, PO Box 360, Trenton, NJ 08625-0360.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-19 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi’s pre-K program earns high marks. Why did lawmakers create another one?,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/19/mississippi-pre-k-program-gets-high-marks-why-did-lawmakers-create-another/,Mississippi already had a successful pre-kindergarten program. But legislators created a second one.,"PETAL — Preschoolers kneel on a kaleidoscope rug, their clumsy hands reaching for wooden blocks, little socked feet tucked underneath.
Block by block, they build a tower that only teeters a little, and for a moment, stands tall. The kids grin proudly. And when it tumbles to the ground a few seconds later, the classroom corner is filled with the sound of giggles.
A bystander might think this is just play. But the teacher watching nearby knows they’re learning essential fine-motor skills. They’re also learning social skills by sharing with their classmates. 
Thanks to a statewide investment in early education more than a decade ago, about one in six Mississippi children is learning these integral skills within the first few years of life at “early learning collaboratives” throughout the state. Experts agree the program is directly connected to the state’s reading gains that have garnered national attention. 
So when lawmakers created another state-funded pre-K program in 2022, some wondered: Why do we need both? One legislative leader who helped create the collaboratives is concerned the new program might siphon away resources, or recreate some of the problems the state faced for decades with early learning.
Early learning collaboratives, a state and taxpayer funded pre-K program established by the Legislature in 2013, created education partnerships in communities across Mississippi. The program has high academic standards, and it brings together child-care centers, nonprofit organizations, school districts and Head Start agencies. It compensates the groups for partnering. 
In 2021, just 18 collaboratives were serving about 3,000 4-year-olds throughout the state, but the program still landed Mississippi top marks for early education from a national research group.

Four years later, that count has more than doubled. Now, 40 collaboratives across Mississippi have more than 6,000 kids enrolled. 
But a new program, called the state-invested pre-K program, or SIP, doesn’t require collaboration with Head Start centers, which provide a myriad of services beyond education for some of the state’s neediest children. Additionally, because of the way the program is set up, there’s less red tape.
For those reasons, it may be a more appealing option for underfunded districts looking to make their dollars go further. It’s frustrating for Sen. Brice Wiggins, a Republican from Pascagoula, who championed the original program that required collaboration among pre-K partners, instead of fighting over students and the money that follows them.
“As I understand it, the SIP program has its roots in something that has always plagued early education in Mississippi,” he said. “Competition.” 
‘Skin in the game’
There was an old saying among the police officers and prosecutors in Jackson County, Wiggins remembers from his time working in the district attorney’s office. 
“They said they determined the amount of prison beds by how well kids performed in the third and fourth grade,” he recalled, in his office at the state Capitol in June. “That resonated.”
When he was elected to the state Senate, those kids were fresh on his mind.
Wiggins spent 2012, his first year at the Capitol, advocating for early childhood education and began working up a plan to reshape the state’s system with policy researcher Rachel Canter. They partnered with then-Republican Rep. Toby Barker, who is now an independent and serves as mayor of Hattiesburg. By the time the next year rolled around — 2013, a seminal year for education in Mississippi — Wiggins thought he had something good.

As lawmakers were working up what would become the literacy act that fundamentally changed reading education in Mississippi, leaders in the Legislature were signing off on Wiggins’ early education plan. It addressed the “patchwork of pre-kindergarten entities” in Mississippi and the lack of coordination between them. When students enroll in different pre-K programs, money follows — tuition at private day-care facilities or federal funding at Head Start are two examples. The collaboratives had a goal of eliminating the infighting that happens in communities over 4-year-olds by giving stakeholders a financial incentive to work together.
The bill passed by a vast bipartisan majority in 2013 and lawmakers appropriated $3 million for it. The Mississippi Department of Education selected 11 communities to host the first collaboratives.
In a collaborative, there’s a lead partner — usually the local school district, but it can be a nonprofit organization — that has local responsibility over the program. They’re in charge of disbursing funds, facilitating professional development and ensuring everyone is adhering to standards. 
Those standards are rigorous. The bill requires collaboratives to use a curriculum that aligns with benchmarks from the National Institute of Early Education Research. This includes having teachers with bachelor’s degrees and at least 15 hours of professional development a year.
The collaborative’s lead partner is required to work with other local pre-kindergarten providers such as child care and Head Start centers to be eligible for the collaborative and its funding, which was originally $2,150 per student (That amount has since increased to $5,000). But the costs quickly add up. The $3 million from the Legislature got them started The state agreed to pay half of each student’s education costs. The rest had to come from the communities. 
Enter the part that Wiggins is most proud of: To make up the other half, the Legislature created a tax-credit program. That means businesses and individuals can donate to their local collaborative and receive a dollar-for-dollar credit on their taxes. 
“That created some skin in the game,” he said.

Setting students up for success
Deanna Hathorn holds open a book at the front of the classroom, and every face is turned toward her. 
“‘Justin dreamt that he could fly,’” she reads in a lilting voice. 
Then Hathorn directs her students: “Hold one finger up if you have dreams!”
Immediately, tiny index fingers fly into the air.
Petal, a suburb of Hattiesburg, was one of the first communities to opt into the early learning collaborative program. 
Prior to the program, it was relatively common for Petal students to enter kindergarten without any classroom education because options were limited to Head Start and a handful of Christian-based schools, similar to many other Mississippi towns, according Jana Perry. Perry is Petal’s former primary school assistant principal and the current director of the district’s Coleman Center for Children and Families, the lead partner for the Petal Early Learning Collaborative.
That’s because pre-kindergarten was not funded by the state before 2013. 
“The act was a game-changer,” she said. “If we didn’t have this, we would be so far behind. Why we are doing so well as a state is because of early childhood education.” 
Wiggins said Petal is one of the state’s most successful early learning collaboratives, in its reach and academic achievement. About 300 kids in Petal enter the district’s kindergarten program every year. Most will have gone through the collaborative, which currently has 179 students across 10 classrooms at five sites. 
The difference between the students who have had a year in the collaborative and the ones who haven’t is stark, Perry said. 
Mississippi Department of Education data shows that collaborative students outperform their peers on the statewide kindergarten readiness assessment. That’s because the collaborative students enter kindergarten more familiar with classroom structure and the curriculum. Plus, some potential barriers to learning may have already been identified, Perry said. For example, collaborative teachers can intervene if a child has a speech impediment, potentially making a year’s worth of progress by the time that student enters kindergarten. 
“We can go ahead and get them set up to succeed once they walk in the door,” she said. “And they know how to do school. Kids who haven’t been through pre-K really struggle in their first year in kindergarten.”
The impact of early education echoes throughout a child’s life, said Steven Barnett, founder of the National Institute for Early Education Research. 
“The first thing you’ll notice is that the students do better when they get to kindergarten, and then they do better on those early grade exams,” Barnett said. “But the next thing you’ll notice is they’re less likely to fail and have to repeat. They’re less likely to need special education, and they’re going to be more likely to graduate from high school and go on to higher education.

“That’s the big payoff, because that’s where you get better health outcomes, better employment, better incomes.”
Petal superintendent Matt Dillon said the first cohort of early learning collaborative students are now in high school, and the impact of the program is tangible — in test scores, expected graduation rates and school environment. 
“This is a community that really recognized the importance of early education,” he said. “And fast forward to today, we’re reaping the benefits.”
That success of early learning collaboratives is why, when Wiggins heard about the new state-funded pre-kindergarten program created in 2022, he was confused — and, honestly, a little agitated. 
“Nobody asked me about it,” Wiggins said. “And if they had, I would have said, ‘No.’”
New program may fit smaller communities
Union, a tiny town in piney central Mississippi anchored by a couple of four-way stops, is home to about 2,000 people. Most of the town’s 4-year-olds are in three classrooms at the Union Elementary School’s campus, thanks to funding from the new SIP program. 
On the whole, it’s not dissimilar from early learning collaborative classrooms in Petal. In rainbow-decorated rooms, children take care of baby dolls, listen to stories read aloud and match letters on worksheets.
But policy differences set the two programs apart.
The SIP program, which was funded in 2022, paid schools $100,000 for each early education classroom, and an extra $25,000 each if the school partnered with its local Head Start. However, that partnership is not required. This policy was slightly changed for the newest batch of participating schools — now, if they do not partner with the local Head Start, the district receives a fraction of that money.
Additionally, while the early learning collaboratives are enshrined in and regulated by state law, the SIP program is simply a line item in the annual education appropriation bill. That means its existence is subject to the whims of legislative approval each year.
The Mississippi Department of Education works hard to make sure all participating schools are in compliance — the SIP program meets all 10 of NIEER’s quality early education benchmarks, as does the collaborative program — but the agency doesn’t have to. 
Jill Dent, the agency’s early childhood director, said in an emailed statement that the department advocates equally for both programs. 
“Our goal is to support districts in choosing the model that best fits their local needs and capacity,” she wrote. 
It’s not unusual, Barnett said, for states to have more than one early education program. But it does beg the question: Who does the SIP program serve? 
“Sometimes, one program doesn’t fit everybody,” he said. “But sometimes, it’s just politics.” 
The politics didn’t matter to longtime Union Superintendent Tyler Hansford. He just didn’t see a collaborative working for his community. It’s small, doesn’t have many child care centers and the closest Head Start — which Union does work with — is a 30-minute drive. And he’s happy with the decision he’s made, already able to see the positive impact the program is having in Union.
“We’re able to reach more students and get them in early,” he said. “What we’ve seen is that there’s tremendous benefit in that.”
Hansford saw more bang for his buck with the SIP program, along with 32 other communities across Mississippi. Perry and Barnett said they both understand why those districts have made the decision to opt into the SIP program over the collaborative program.
Some districts might not want to partner with as many entities as the collaboratives require because they’re happy with the way they do things. Others, such as Union, might not have as many resources or options in their community to support a collaborative. 
But some places that are short on money have made the collaborative structure work, such as Tallahatchie County, a tiny community in the Delta with a median household income of $23,000. 
Tallahatchie hosts one of the state’s original early learning collaboratives. The lead partner, nonprofit Tallahatchie Early Learning Alliance, brings together local Head Starts and East Tallahatchie School District and has served more than 1,000 students since the local program began in 2014. 
There were no publicly funded pre-K classrooms prior to the collaborative and only a handful of child-care centers. Only two served low-income children and they had long waitlists, said Cheryl Swoopes, director of community engagement for SonEdna, which launched Tallahatchie Early Learning Alliance. 
“With limited resources, it’s a process, but we’ve stayed the course,” she said. “We’ve had teachers and administrators tell us that they wouldn’t know what to do if TELA wasn’t here.”
Today, the Tallahatchie collaborative is the only coordinated, fully funded pre-K effort in the county, and in Wiggins’ view, if Tallahatchie can do it, anyone can. 
“The ELC, it is work,” said Perry, from Petal. “There’s a lot of work. But it’s very worth it.”
Looking ahead
Despite stagnant state test scores this year, Mississippi continues to revel in the glow of its national academic achievements, particularly in literacy and early education.
Wiggins believes those achievements are in no small part due to the collaboratives. He hopes to see the program expand to include younger students and more communities in the next 10 years. 
Access is still low, with enrollment rates of 17.7% of all Mississippi 4-year-olds. The SIP program reaches about 900 kids, or about 2.4% of 4-year-olds.  A recent report from Barnett’s organization noted that neighboring Alabama serves twice as many four-year-olds.
Neither of Mississippi’s pre-K programs serve 3-year-olds.

Since early learning collaboratives were established, funding has steadily increased. The original $3 million allotment is now up to $29 million, plus $3.25 million for the program’s coaches. 
The SIP program received $13 million in the most recent appropriations bill. 
“Our scores in kindergarten readiness continue to go up, and the nation understands what we’ve done,” Wiggins said. “But we’ve got to continue to do things. 
“We’ve got to reduce the friction in the early education world in Mississippi because it should be about the kids. We have something that works. We need to continue to support that.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/29120532/No-faces-1.jpg,,,2025-09-19 07:56:13.853743

A newly amended proposal from the state Department of Workforce Development (DWD) calls for repealing Wisconsin’s ban on jobless pay for people who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) income.
The proposal follows a federal court ruling that found the ban violates two federal laws protecting people with disabilities.
Until this week, however, DWD’s proposal to repeal the ban included an additional provision: While a person receiving SSDI payments would be eligible for unemployment insurance after losing a job, disability income would “offset” — cancel out — some or all of the individual’s unemployment compensation.
The SSDI proposal was one of a dozen changes to the state’s unemployment insurance law that DWD submitted to the joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council earlier this year. The council, a long-standing body with equal representation from business and labor, negotiates changes to the state’s unemployment insurance laws every two years.
On Thursday, DWD submitted an amended version of its SSDI proposal. The new version repeals the ban on jobless pay for SSDI recipients and omits the offset provision.
“This is wonderful news for everyone involved and for the state of Wisconsin in general, disabled or non-disabled,” said lawyer Victor Forberger.
Forberger has specialized in representing people whose unemployment insurance claims have been rejected. He was one of the lawyers who sued DWD in federal court in 2021 to overturn the state law banning jobless pay for SSDI recipients.
Jobless pay ban violates federal law
U.S. District Judge William Conley ruled in July 2024 that the jobless pay ban violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.
Even after that ruling, DWD continued to deny unemployment claims made by people on SSDI. This July 14, Conley ordered DWD to stop disqualifying SSDI recipients from unemployment compensation.
In August, the judge ordered DWD to pay jobless benefits to eligible applicants who were denied because they received SSDI payments between Sept. 7, 2015 — when the SSDI-unemployment ban law was last revised — and July 30, 2025. Conley also ordered DWD to pay back people who had collected jobless pay but then ordered to pay back the money because they were on SSDI.
The federal Social Security Administration program allows and encourages disability insurance recipients to work part-time if they are able to.
During the administration of Gov. Scott Walker, however, DWD asserted in a  proposal that disability payment recipients who applied for unemployment insurance were probably “double-dipping” and committing “fraud.” The ban on unemployment pay for SSDI recipients was enacted in 2013, during Walker’s first term, and revised in 2015 during his second term.
DWD proposes unemployment insurance changes
Earlier this year DWD drafted 12 proposed revisions to Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance law for the joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council to consider.
The department’s SSDI proposal called for repealing the ban on jobless pay, but also called for offsetting an SSDI recipient’s unemployment compensation on the basis of the disability income.
When Forberger read the DWD proposal and saw the offset provision, he wrote about it on his blog about unemployment insurance policy and wrote to the labor caucus members of the advisory council urging them not to support it.
The offset provision was still part of DWD’s SSDI repeal recommendation when the department presented its proposals to the advisory council in August.
The offset provision surprised state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) when it came to her attention. Sinicki has often scolded lawmakers when they introduce bills to change the unemployment compensation system without sending them through the joint labor-management council.
“I’ve always been a stickler for, you vote yes on the agreed-upon bill [from the advisory council] because it was a compromise between both parties,” Sinicki told the Wisconsin Examiner on Thursday. But when she learned of the offset provision, “I made it very clear that I would not vote for any bill that had that in there.”
Sinicki along with Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) have authored their own proposal to repeal the SSDI jobless pay ban after the court ordered DWD to stop enforcing it. Both said they opposed DWD’s offset proposal and that they were glad to see that the department scrapped it Thursday.
‘Discrimination. Full stop.’
“What’s happening right now is discrimination. Full stop,” Dassler-Alfheim said in a written statement to the Wisconsin Examiner. “That’s why the federal judge ruled against it, that’s why Representative Sinicki and I have proposed legislation to remove it from state statute, and I’m glad to see that DWD has put forth this amendment” removing the offset.
Three proposed budgets from Gov. Tony Evers included recommendations to end the SSDI jobless pay ban, but with an offset provision as well. Those largely went unnoticed at the time, and were removed along with hundreds of other Evers proposals by the Republican leaders of the Joint Finance Committee during budget deliberations.
It wasn’t clear Thursday what prompted DWD to remove the offset provision from its latest proposal. The department memo to the joint advisory council said that it was already complying with Conley’s order to process benefit claims for SSDI recipients and would do so for previously-denied claims without an offset.
Amending its proposed change in the law to remove the offset provision “will align with the effect of the court’s order that is now allowing claimants who receive SSDI to be eligible for the full amount of their weekly benefit without a reduction for any SSDI received,” the memo states.
Sinicki said that while she was outspoken about her opposition to the offset provision, she had not directly communicated that either to DWD or to members of the advisory council.
A spokesperson for Dassler-Alfheim said she also had not been in direct contact with DWD or the Evers administration about her opposition to the offset.

Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin testifying against the U.S. Army during the Army-McCarthy hearings in Washington, D.C., June 9, 1954. McCarthy stands before a map which charts Communist activity in the United States. (Photo by Getty Images)Driven by “a lineup of disgraceful racial bigots and American fascists,” a divisive political crusade by conservatives in the United States was “like a gigantic, tumultuous hurricane” that “dominated the thoughts and actions of the American people, disrupting their emotions, distorting their judgment ….” Those are the words of Michigan Republican Charles E. Potter, a member of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, who, in his 1965 book “Days of Shame,” repudiated the excesses of the McCarthy era.
I read Potter’s 60-year-old mea culpa in David Maraniss’s powerful personal history, “A Good American Family: The Red Scare and My Father,” (Simon & Schuster 2019), which traces the Maraniss family’s harrowing journey to Madison, Wisconsin. The anti-McCarthy Capital Times newspaper saved Maraniss’s dad, Elliott, giving him a job after he was blacklisted and then followed from town to town by federal agents investigating his political activities over “five years, five cities, four kids, eight homes, two papers that fired him, three papers that folded,” as Maraniss writes.
I binge-read the book amid a storm of news as the administration of President Donald Trump ramped up attacks on leftwing activists, Democrats, progressive nonprofits and the media, blaming them for the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, and vowing to attack what White House adviser Stephen Miller called a “vast domestic terror movement,” using the full force of the federal government to “identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks.” 
I reached out to Maraniss Thursday in Madison, where the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author grew up and still spends summers. ABC had just indefinitely suspended late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel for criticizing the MAGA movement’s weaponization of the Kirk shooting. And Trump and his FCC chairman were threatening to yank broadcasting licenses from media outlets that criticize the president.
I wanted to ask Maraniss about the parallels he sees between the time he describes so vividly in his book and the current moment. 
“There are several obvious haunting similarities,” he told me on the phone, “the demonization of others, the calling of all opponents Marxist or communists or enemies of the state, the gross manipulation of truth, the use of fear to stifle dissent and pressure to silence the media or get the press to go along.”
“Back then,” he added, “most of the press did go along with McCarthy for a long time.”
The Capital Times stood out as an early critic of Wisconsin’s bombastic Red-hunting senator, Joseph McCarthy. Syndicated columnist Drew Pearson was another prominent anti-McCarthy voice, along with Murrey Marder of the Washington Post and Edward R. Murrow — all mentioned in Maraniss’s book. “But you could cite many more that were going along with McCarthyism.”
The main difference Maraniss sees between the McCarthy era and today is that “McCarthy was only a senator, and now we’re dealing with the president, with full control of the levers of power which McCarthy did not have, ranging from the Justice Department to the military.”
McCarthy took aim at major U.S. institutions — from government agencies to  universities to Hollywood to mainline Protestant churches — but he overstepped when began attacking the U.S. Army, infuriating then-President Dwight Eisenhower. 
Another glaring difference between then and now, Maraniss added, “is that McCarthy did not have the full support of his own party, the Republican Party.” Today, “almost any Republican who opposed Trump is now no longer in office or in the party.”
It took a long time, however, for mainstream media and mainstream Republicans to turn against McCarthyism and for the public to swing from the distorted thinking former HUAC member Potter finally repudiated to the consensus that leftwing political ideology did not, in fact, pose an existential threat to U.S. national security.
Among the many echoes of Red Scare fever resonating through national politics today is the central issue of race. One of the most gripping scenes in Maraniss’s book is future Detroit Mayor Coleman Young’s testimony before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the Federal Building in Detroit. Young, a World War II veteran, confronts the southern racists on the committee as they question his loyalty, repeatedly correcting their slurring pronunciation of the world “Negro.” Despite the committee’s high-handedness and multiple attempts to silence him, Young has the last word. 
“I fought in the last war and I would unhesitatingly take up arms against anybody that attacks this country,” he says. “In the same manner, I am now in the process of fighting against what I consider to be attacks and discrimination against my people. I am fighting against un-American activities such as lynchings and denial of the vote. I am dedicated to that fight and I don’t think I must apologize or explain it to anybody, my position on that.”
Reading about Young and the other brave souls who stood up to McCarthyism, including the elder Maraniss’s lawyer, George Crockett, who was jailed for contempt and returned to continue fighting, is inspiring and thrilling. 
In contrast, Maraniss traces the sordid history of U.S. Rep. John Stephens Wood, a Democrat from Georgia and chairman of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan (though he claimed he only went to one meeting). He lays out the evidence that Wood attended the lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish industrialist who was accused of killing of a young, female factory worker in Georgia. Wood was the “wheelman” for Judge Newt Morris, his mentor, helping to collect the body from the lynchers and drive it to the morgue. 
White racists, as Potter later acknowledged, played a prominent role in the McCarthy era purges of “un-American” activists. These were the people who sat in judgment of civil rights leaders, Black unionists and activists for racial equality. Maraniss’s father, an antifascist who joined the Communist Party when he was in college at the University of Michigan, led an all-Black battalion in World War II, and dedicated his life to his idealistic view of America, was the target of people who had little respect for equal rights or the Constitution.
Who are the real patriots, Maraniss asks — a question that resonates today.
“Race is at the center of American life, then and now,” Maraniss said on the phone. “And what we’re facing this time is really an attempt to erase the civil rights movement.”
“The chairman of the House un American Activities Committee that went after my father was a Georgia racist who was elected in white-only primaries and opposed every civil rights measure, and he was the one defining what’s an American,” he said. “And you have a similar thing going on now where Charlie Kirk is celebrated on NFL stadium screens and people are being fired left and right, for criticizing someone who disparaged Martin Luther King.”
It’s important not to be cowed by the deliberate use of language as a weapon to promote misunderstanding, he said, “as they have with DEI. I mean, what is on its face wrong with diversity, equity and inclusion, you know? Think about it. I mean, the same thing with being antifascist. I mean, people should embrace those ideas and not run away from them.”
Of his parents, Maraniss writes: “They never betrayed America and loved it no less than the officials who rendered judgment on them in Room 740 of the Federal Building in Detroit. They were dissenters who believed the nation had not lived up to its founding ideals in terms of race and equality, largely because of the reactionary attitudes of self-righteous attackers on the American right.”

The book ends happily. The Maraniss family arrived in Wisconsin in time to watch the Milwaukee Braves play their way to a pennant and eventually beat the Yankees in the World Series. “McCarthy was dead. The Supreme Court had essentially overturned the Smith Act, ruling it was unconstitutional to bring charges against American citizens solely because of their political advocacy. … The world was opening anew.”
But there is, of course, no real end to the struggle. In an epilogue, Maraniss writes about Cap Times reporter John Patrick Hunter, who, long after the Red Scare was safely over,  typed up sections of the preamble to the Declaration of Independence, combined it with a petition listing six of the 10 amendments to the Bill of Rights, along with the Fifteenth Amendment granting Black men the right to vote, then roamed a local park in Madison trying to collect signatures. “He gave the people the nation’s foundational truth and it did not go well,” Maraniss writes. “Of the 112 people he asked to sign the petition. Only one did. Twenty accused him of being a communist.”
“It is an endless struggle,” Maraniss said on the phone. “That’s what life is. And you know, it tends to go in cycles of reaction and counter reaction. This is a very, very difficult one of those cycles. But I’ve been an optimist my whole life. It’s being challenged like never before in my life. My father endured it and came out an optimist anyway, somehow. So to honor my father, I maintain my optimism.”

Jackson Hole’s wild bison herd is distinct from the one in Yellowstone National Park.
The post Battle of the behemoths: Wyoming’s bison kick off the rut appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s wild bison are the first of the ungulates (hooved animals) to kick off the fall breeding season, or rut. 
For bison, the rut starts in July, but really gets going in August and carries into September. At some 2,000 pounds, bull bison are the largest land mammals in North America.
Watching these rutting behemoths battle each other, roll in the dust and incessantly chase the cows is truly an impressive sight. One might think the bison of Yellowstone and Jackson Hole are one big herd, but they’re not.

They are two distinct herds, with little interchange between them. The history of the Jackson Bison Herd is an interesting one. 
Bison were native to all of Wyoming and several surrounding states, once numbering in the hundreds of millions. The decimation of bison across their expansive range throughout the 1800s has been well documented, and by the mid 1880s they were extirpated outside Yellowstone National Park.

Jackson Hole wouldn’t see bison again until 1948 when 20 animals were brought to a fenced enclosure called the Jackson Hole Wildlife Park west of Moran Junction, near what is known today as Oxbow Bend in Grand Teton National Park. The wildlife park was also a place for visitors to see elk, moose, deer and pronghorn antelope.

The breeding season for elk, moose and pronghorn typically begins in early to mid-September and runs through October. Deer generally start in November and bighorn sheep begin in late November into December.
It is reported that the bison would regularly escape their pen each year and have to be rounded up. In 1969, park officials decided to stop trying to round up the escapees and thus began the modern day free-ranging wild bison herd in Jackson Hole.
In 1975, it is reported that the bison discovered the National Elk Refuge at the southern end of the Jackson Hole valley, near the town of Jackson. Soon after, they would also find the supplemental winter feed that had been doled out for the free-roaming elk herd since the creation of the refuge in 1912.
Absent normal winter mortality, the bison population began to grow at a rapid rate. By the mid-1990s, the Jackson bison herd was approaching 1,000 animals. Bison were showing up on horse and cattle feed lines on private lands, sometimes goring livestock. Bison were also regularly having to be herded off the green grass of Jackson Hole golf courses and residences along the Snake River and in the town of Kelly. Bison numbers needed to be controlled.
As with all of Wyoming’s big game, recreational hunting was the desired tool of wildlife managers for curbing growth. And there was no shortage of hunters ready and willing to help bring numbers down.

However, through legal action, the Fund for Animals successfully blocked bison hunting on the National Elk Refuge until an interagency management plan was approved in 2007, which allowed for hunting on the refuge. By this time the bison herd had hit 1,200 animals.
Over the next several years, hunters would help managers bring the population back down to the desired population objective of 500, which is where it hovers today. Still, Wyoming is one of only a handful of places in the world with a wild, free-ranging bison herd for all to enjoy.

In late August, the Colorado-based runner completed an out-and-back of the iconic 13,775-foot peak in a blistering 3:45:34. She did it just days after a Canadian runner set a new female record on the mountain.
The post No fanfare, no shortcuts: Jane Maus breaks female speed record on Grand Teton appeared first on WyoFile .","There’s been a lot of hubbub over the last year surrounding the Grand Teton speed attempt. Runner Michelino Sunseri’s now-infamous 2024 shortcut set off a national debate and courtroom saga over outdoor ethics, the responsibilities of professional athletes with thousands of followers and hefty penalties for trail transgressions. 
Amid all of this, a professional runner from Boulder, Colorado, quietly set her sights on the vaunted peak. Jane Maus temporarily relocated to the Tetons in August, scouted the Grand and began her own journey toward breaking the female speed record.
With very little fanfare and zero shortcuts, Maus did just that on Aug. 22. She ran the 13.2-miles out-and-back route — with its sections of technical scrambling and some 7,000 feet of elevation gain — in a blistering 3:45:34. That put her more than 20 minutes faster than the previous fastest known time, or FKT, which was set just three days earlier by Canadian runner Jazmine Lowther. 
It was by all accounts a stunning physical accomplishment. Maus had gone into the Aug. 22 attempt thinking more that it was another chance to hone her route than to set the record. She was unaccompanied. There was no cameraman to photograph her, no social media buzz to build excitement. But it all fell into place. 
When she ran back into the parking lot and realized what she had done, she said, there wasn’t even anyone to high five. She was so early that her partner hadn’t arrived yet to pick her up. 
“It still feels kind of surreal,” she told WyoFile weeks later. 
Along with setting new benchmarks, Maus and Lowther’s feats also signify a new fidelity to what are considered authorized routes in the niche world of high-alpine speed records. Both women followed what is known as the “Modern Route.”

Fastest Known Time, the organization that tracks these records, recently updated the language in its Grand Teton entry page to note that the Modern Route differs from the Historical Route. That latter includes the shortcut that landed Sunseri in hot water. Previous record holders including Killian Jornet and Jen Day Denton also used the Historical Route. 
“The [Grand Teton National park] Jenny Lake Rangers now prefer that runners stick to designated and maintained trails (where available), which aligns with this Modern Route,” the page reads. “FastestKnownTime indicated it will not accept future submissions using the Historical Route, though it remains an integral part of the mountain’s history and lore.”
For Maus, the old route with the shortcut was never an option. 
“With everything that had happened, and now moving forward, it’s not acceptable to cut the switchback,” she said. “That never crossed my mind.”
Super daunting
Before this season, Maus wasn’t a household name. The 30-year-old dietician grew up in the Salt Lake Valley, where she gained comfort with scrambling through the mountains. She played college-level soccer, and a passion for trail running and rock climbing eventually led to endurance runs and a La Sportiva sponsorship.
Maus’ coach first urged her to try the Grand Teton FKT this spring, saying it would fit in well with her skillset of climbing and running. 
“I was like, ‘that’s absolutely crazy,’” she said.
But after a couple more people brought it up to her, she started considering it. Since she works remotely, she had the flexibility. She decided to at least spend some time on the mountain, though she didn’t presume she was going to break the record, she said. 
“I just kind of committed to trying it out,” she said. “I really had no idea what to expect. But I was like, ‘I have the time. It seems like a really cool objective. I’m just gonna go for it.’”
Maus first climbed the mountain on Aug. 2, alongside her partner, who had climbed it before. They took their time figuring out the route. The technical section was actually not as difficult as she expected, but still. The whole thing took nearly seven hours.

Even seven hours is beyond the realm of most people when it comes to the Grand. The out-and-back climb entails many trail miles along with complex route finding through boulders and technical scrambling. Jackson-area guiding companies typically hike clients up to a saddle, camp overnight, then summit the following morning using ropes and climbing gear for the technical sections before descending to the valley. 
The notion of cutting the entire ordeal to under Denton’s time of 4:15, Maus said, was “super daunting.”
“When it took us almost seven hours, I was like, ‘absolutely not. That’s so much time to cut off,’” she said. 
Training 
Maus climbed the Grand four more times over the next three weeks, each time learning more of the route’s nuances and how to better move through it, she said. But every summit also brought more doubt that she could run up and down in four hours. 
At the same time, there was another athlete gunning for the Grand speed record. Lowther, a runner who has been notching FKTs and top race results in recent years, was in the area with Sunseri, her coach and partner, with her eyes on the Grand. 
Maus bumped into Lowther on that first climb up the mountain. On Aug. 11, Lowther notched the fastest known time in the supported category, which basically means a crew or person is there to help with things like route finding and water carrying. In this case, Sunseri ran with her through the technical terrain, and she finished with a time of 3:51:12. 
“It was a full circle moment for the duo, setting the first GPX-verified FKT on the modern route,” according to an Instagram post from Lowther’s sponsor, Arcteryx. 
Eight days later, Lowther returned to run the mountain alone for the first time. She claimed the unsupported FKT with a time of 4:06:58.

Lowther’s achievements unnerved Maus, she said. Maus had by then done the Grand four times and began doubting that she could nab a speed record in the rapidly closing weather window. On Friday, Aug. 22, she got dropped off in the Lupine Meadows parking lot a little before 8 a.m. to do her fifth climb. 
“But I did not feel ready to go for the FKT, by any means,” she said. Instead, her main goal of the day was to better figure out the technical section up top. 
The morning
She had Lowther’s unsupported time of 4:06 in her mind, however, and felt nervous like she does on race mornings. She decided to just try her hardest, no expectations. 
She shot out of the parking lot. The weather was perfect. Getting up to the boulder field, she realized she was ahead of her previous pace. But in the boulders, her legs felt trashed, and she worried that she would bonk. Despite that, she moved efficiently. She began to pick up steam in the fourth-class scrambling between the lower and upper saddle. 
When she hit the summit, she was surprised to find she climbed it 10 minutes faster than ever before, she said. 
“That’s really when I turned it on,” Maus said. “I’m not the strongest descender … but I kind of shut off my brain and went into race mode, and the descent is where I gained most of my time.”

In an attempt like this, the smallest setback can make or break it. But Maus’ descent, like her climb, was smooth. She sprinted into the parking lot that marked the end point. No one was there. 
She looked at her watch, saw that she was 20 minutes faster than the record, and had a moment of disbelief, she said. She wondered briefly if she unwittingly cut a section. She checked her route again, and texted her coach. 
It took a moment for reality to set in, she said, but when her partner arrived, they spent about an hour at the trailhead, celebrating her achievement and reflecting. 
Maus’ accomplishment sets a new standard in mountain running. She still seems a little surprised by it all.
“I had so many people around me that believed I could do this, but I truly did not believe in myself,” she wrote in an Instagram post. “Now I believe them a little bit more.”
She was also humble about the mantle, saying she doesn’t expect to hold onto it. 
“I am confident the strong women in this sport will bring this time way down, and I am so excited that I get to be a part of the story of the Grand Teton,” she wrote. “I truly feel so, so lucky right now.”

André Jacque (R-New Franken), the lead author on the proposal, […]","Gov. Tony Evers and Veterans Affairs Sec. James Bond spoke an event for veterans in the state Capitol on April 22, 2025. (Photo via Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs Facebook page)A Republican bill that would provide funding for the Veterans Housing and Recovery Program received a hearing in the state Senate on Thursday, advancing a potential solution to the cuts the program is facing even as it appears too late to stop the closures. 
Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken), the lead author on the proposal, told the Senate Natural Resources, Veteran and Military Affairs committee that it is the responsibility of lawmakers to ensure that Wisconsin “properly honors the sacrifices made by our brave men and women of the armed services” and his bill would help do that. He also serves as the chair of the committee.
“I know that there’s been a lot of confusion and contentious finger pointing over responsibility for the interruption of service at these sites. Ideally, these issues would have already been resolved but finger pointing accomplishes nothing,” Jacque said. 
The Veterans Housing and Recovery Program (VHRP) has been a source of back-and-forth between Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic lawmakers and Republican lawmakers since the closure of two sites, one in Chippewa Falls and the other in the Green Bay area, was announced in July. 
The program, operated by the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, has focused on providing support to veterans on the verge of or experiencing homelessness, including those who have experienced incarceration, unemployment or physical and mental health problems. Veterans in the program are able to participate for a maximum of 24 months, but the average length of stay is six to 10 months.
Evers announced in July that the sites would close on Sept. 30 due to a lack of state funding in the budget. He had requested an additional $2 million from lawmakers to help sustain the program, but that request wasn’t heeded and Democratic attempts to put the funding back in the budget were rejected by Republicans — apart from Jacque, who voted with Democrats. 
Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced shortly after the end of the budget process in July that the two facilities would be closing. 
Evers blamed the closures on lawmakers for not providing the additional funds, while lawmakers said Evers didn’t try to negotiate for the funding.
Then some Republican lawmakers who represent areas surrounding the facilities started claiming that money should be available for the administration to use. In a 16-page letter on Sept. 10, a handful of Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) and Jesse James (R-Thorp) and Reps. Karen Hurd (R-Withee) and Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere), claimed that the Evers administration should have access to funds to help support the program. That letter pointed to the balance that the WDVA returns at the end of the year, though an agency spokesperson has noted that the agency cannot spend funds on whatever the administration chooses, and is “only allowed to spend the money they tell us to spend.”
Evers had also denied the claim, saying “the money is not there.” He noted that a paper from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau to the Joint Finance Committee warned lawmakers that additional funds were needed for the program. 
“Without additional funding, the Department [of Veterans Affairs] would not have sufficient resources to maintain the program’s three sites,” the paper stated.
Senate Bill 411 would provide $900,000 in 2025-26 and $1,050,000 in 2026-27 for the program and for costs associated with the Chippewa Falls site. Jacque’s bill also includes two other policy changes that he said veterans have been requesting. One would require the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin system to provide funding to the UW Missing-in-Action Recovery and Identification Project to support missions to recover and identify Wisconsin veterans who are missing, and the other would lower the eligibility threshold for veterans and surviving spouses to claim the veterans and surviving spouses property tax credit.
“We have the opportunity to achieve a proactive, bipartisan solution to the funding problem, and I encourage my committee members to join me in approving this funding package,” Jacque said. “Supporting our veterans has not been and must not be a partisan fight. I truly believe there’s enough support and good will on both sides of the aisle to accomplish each of these priorities.” 
The bill does currently has only nine Republican sponsors and no Democratic sponsors. Democratic lawmakers had proposed their own bill with Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) saying at a press conference that she preferred “clean legislation.” That bill is unlikely to advance in the Republican-led Legislature even as Democrats call for a bill hearing on it. 
Jacque said legislators are also discussing  the potential for the Joint Finance Committee to reallocate funds for the program, and that his conversations about his bill have been productive on both sides of the aisle. 
“That was my goal in bringing it forward immediately after the budget was done, to have a vehicle to continue that conversation and make sure that we get some additional progress done on these issues beyond budget,” Jacque said. 
The VHRP has been funded through three revenue streams: trust fund payments, payments made by program participants and per diem payments, which are made to the agency by the federal government at a current rate of about $71 per resident per day. 
Growing staffing and maintenance costs have strained those funds. A contract with Lutheran Social Services, which staffs the facilities, makes up about 70% of the costs. The Evers administration had postponed some of the looming financial hardship by allocating American Rescue Plan Act funding to the program in 2023-24, but those funds have been expended. 
WDVA Assistant Deputy Secretary Joey Hoey said in testimony that it is too late to stop the closure of the facilities at least for a time.
Hoey said that when the budget passed on July 3, the three VHRP sites were in their fourth year of the federal VA’s Grant and Per Diem (GPD) Program with the option to renew for a fifth and final year starting October 1, 2025.
The agency was forced to consolidate the facilities to the Union Grove location, the site in best physical condition, without dedicated state funding for the program. The agency also had to notify the USDVA that it would not be renewing its grant agreement for Chippewa Falls. It asked to renew and change the scope of the grant agreement that covers both Union Grove and Green Bay, reducing the total number of beds from 57 to 40 to reflect the closure of the Green Bay facility. 
“Being forced to close our facilities in Green Bay and Chippewa Falls was gut wrenching for the veterans and for staff,” Hoey said. “I want to assure everyone in this room that with the help of veteran advocates, our partners at Lutheran Social Services and others, we were able to provide all the veterans in our care at Green Bay and Chippewa Falls with alternative options. As of last week, neither facility has any veterans still at the facility. All those residents have been successfully placed either in other treatment programs for veterans, other treatment programs that are not veteran centered, some have moved to Minneapolis, some moved to Michigan, a good amount have moved to our facility in Union Grove, but no veterans were kicked out on the street.” 
Hoey said even if the state were to pass the bill before the end of September, the state agency cannot rescind the notification for Chippewa Falls. It would only be able to apply for the next round of grants, which wouldn’t be available until October 2026.
“The earliest we could resume the program in Chippewa Falls would be sometime after October 1, 2026,” Hoey said. “If this bill passes, we stand ready to ask the USDVA to change the scope of our agreement covering Union Grove and Green Bay to go back up to the 57 beds included in the original grant. We believe that the USDVA would approve that change, meaning we could resume the program in Green Bay relatively quickly, provided that the landlord has not rented out the facility we were using and that we can sign a contract with Lutheran Social Services.”

Pete Hegseth’s indifference toward the legal requirements governing the use of military power contrasts greatly with the Founding Fathers, constitutional scholar David Adler writes.
The post Even the defense secretary is required to follow the law appeared first on WyoFile .","Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s indifference to the Constitution and American law, as well as his disdain for “tepid legality” as the governing standard for the use of U.S. military power, places him at sharp odds with those who founded this nation and held the office of the Presidency. John Quincy Adams, after serving as secretary of state and president, said, “the war power is strictly constitutional.” Like his predecessors in the nation’s highest office, Adams fully understood that the president’s authority over foreign relations was no less circumscribed than the domestic powers conferred by the Constitution.

Opinion

Hegseth’s blithe disregard of law is unbecoming of a constitutional officer whose authority exists only by virtue of that vested in his office by the Constitution, which he has sworn an oath to uphold, and such powers as Congress, to which he is legally accountable and subject to  removal through impeachment, may choose to confer upon him. Hegseth’s arrogant dismissal of legal boundaries invites the scale of scorn that the founders reserved for usurpers, those who abused power and obstructed justice, beginning with King George III, whom they singled out in the Declaration of Independence as a tyrant.
Hegseth’s enthusiasm for President Donald Trump’s executive order changing the name of “Department of Defense” to the “Department of War” was reflected in his slam-poetry-like explanation of the rebranding as not just a name change, but a shift in attitude, posture and strategy. Hegseth said the war department is “going to go on offense, not just defense. Maximum lethality, not tepid legality. Violent effect, not politically correct.” Successful prosecution of wars always has been, and always will be, the goal of our armed forces, but it is critical to recall that war, from its commencement to its conclusion, must be conducted in accord with the Constitution and applicable laws. On this point, the founders, and judicial rulings issued at the dawn of the republic, were crystal clear. 
Respect for the Constitution and its allocation of the war power to Congress, fortified by the presidential oath of office and the Article II duty “to take care to faithfully execute the laws,” informed the decisions of founding presidents when questions of war and military hostilities arose. No early president — Jefferson, Madison and Monroe, for example —  shared Hegseth’s disdain for legality.
In 1801, and again in 1805, President Jefferson, faced with military threats from Tripoli and Spain, respectively, refused to go on “offense,” when, “considering that Congress alone is constitutionally invested with changing our condition from peace to war, I have thought it my duty to await their authority for using force.” The threat of invasion did not stop Jefferson from consultation with Congress. 
President Madison, the chief architect of the Constitution, reiterated the constitutional governance of the use of force on June 1, 1812, when he called attention to the English attacks on American shipping. He referred to Congress the question of whether we should oppose “force to force in defense of our national rights,” which he said, was a “solemn question which the Constitution wisely confides to the legislative department of the Government.” 
After the adoption of the Monroe Doctrine, Colombia sought protection from France in 1824. President Monroe, who was a delegate to the Virginia Convention, stated, “The Executive has no right to compromise the nation in any question of war.” He echoed Secretary of State Adams, who declared that the Constitution vests that power in Congress, alone.
Chief Justice John Marshall, a vigorous participant in the Virginia Ratification Convention, stated in Talbot v. Seeman (1801): “The whole power of war being, by the Constitution vested in Congress, the acts of that body can alone be resorted to as our guides in this inquiry.” There was no departure from this understanding in the crisis of the Civil War. In the Prize Cases (1862), the high court held: “By the Constitution, Congress alone has the power to declare a national or foreign war.” The president, “has no power to initiate or declare war against a foreign nation or a domestic State. If a war be made by invasion of a foreign nation, the president is bound to resist force by force. He does not initiate the war but is bound to accept the challenge.”
In matters of war and peace, the founders, unlike Secretary Hegseth, demonstrated respect, not disdain, for legality.

“When ICE said: ‘Hey, would you be interested in doing that?,’ we jumped at the chance,” Garber says. But, he adds, talks have stalled since.
In April, LPSO spokesperson Valerie Ponseti told The Times-Picayune that the sheriff’s office was in “active negotiations with ICE to fulfill key regional functions.”
In an interview with The Current on Friday, Garber confirmed that this was in reference to an offer from his office to federal immigration enforcement agencies to temporarily house immigrant detainees at the jail annex building, a 15,000 square-foot facility built in 1993 to house federal inmates, with enough space for 96 detainees.
However, those negotiations have become less active in recent months, according to Garber. “I haven’t heard anything from them, I can’t get an update,” he says. “I think they’re just overwhelmed.”

The Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Kristi Noem has made a push to utilize state and local facilities to hold immigrant detainees, a population that has increased significantly since the new administration came into office, engaging with governors and state leaders supportive of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement strategy.
“Most of them are interested,” Noem told CBS in early August, “many of them have facilities that may be empty or underutilized.”
Last week, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced that 51 immigrant detainees had been moved to a formerly closed unit at Angola State Penitentiary, with plans to bring that inmate population to 200 by the end of the month. The unit, Camp J, was closed in 2018, citing security concerns and safety risks, but Landry in July declared a state emergency to fast-track fixes.
Louisiana is already one of the states with the largest population of immigrant detainees, second only to Texas, and has become a hub of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.
An increasing number of Louisiana state and local agencies have also entered formal partnerships with ICE.
State agencies from Louisiana Alcohol and Tobacco Control to the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, along with state corrections, police, military and the fire marshal, have all entered agreements with ICE under the 287g program over the past four months. Several local law enforcement agencies are also partners under that program.

Thursday’s address was Underly’s first during her second term in office. She won reelection in April this year. She used the address as an opportunity to call for the state to give more support to schools.
“Public education in Wisconsin is not just a system; it’s a living story written daily by the people who believe in its promise…  by students walking into classrooms filled with possibility, by the teachers who dedicate their lives to unlocking potential, by the families and the communities who support them,” Underly said. However, she warned that pride in the public education story “does not guarantee a happy ending.” 
“Pride alone can’t patch a leaking roof. Pride doesn’t shrink a class of 32. Pride will not put a counselor in every school, and pride does not replace sustainable funding. Pride doesn’t fix inequity,’ Underly said. “Pride must be paired with action.” 
The first several months of Underly’s term have been marked by federal upheaval as the Trump administration has abruptly paused and pulled federal funding that goes to education priorities and also by the completion of a state budget that fell short of public school advocates’ goals. 
Underly said the Trump administration is using funding as a bargaining chip by withholding it with little notice in order to demand schools comply with unclear and unlawful requests. 
Most recently, the Trump administration decided to withhold nearly $11 million in grants to support deafblind students and special education teachers. The explanation delivered to the state DPI was that the programs “reflect the prior administration’s priorities and policy preferences and conflict with those of the current administration.” 










We teach our students to stand up to bullies, but this year, the biggest school-yard bully in our public schools is our own federal government


– Superintendent Jill Underly


Over the summer, schools across the nation were thrown into uncertainty after the Trump administration said it would be withholding Title program payments. The administration eventually reversed its decision. 
“Their efforts seek to sow confusion and create chaos and erode trust in an education system already under incredible pressure. We teach our students to stand up to bullies, but this year, the biggest school-yard bully in our public schools is our own federal government,” Underly said. “We will not allow politics or outside forces to rewrite the story of Wisconsin’s public schools. We will not stand by while the future of our children is at stake. We will fight, we will lead, and we will stand up for every student.”
Underly also said the state government is putting school districts in a situation where they must stretch their budgets and are left to solve their problems alone. 
“Decades of insufficient funding have forced a historic number of districts into an impossible situation, turning to referenda year after year just to survive, all while facing micromanaging from Madison and endless finger pointing from lawmakers who too often choose politics over partisanship,” Underly said. 
The state budget, which was passed by the Republican-led state Legislature and signed by Gov. Tony Evers, included a boost in special education funding from about 30% to 45%. But school districts have said that another aspect of the budget, which made no increase at all in state aid for both years of the biennium, left them in a tight spot. Underly said the budget was “not perfect” but “makes meaningful progress for our schools, especially in special education” and acts as a “starting point.” 
‘Pulling resources away from public schools to fund private ones’
“And here’s the truth: We are starving one system while funding another. We cannot afford to keep pulling resources away from public schools to fund private ones and expect both to thrive. That is not good stewardship, and that is not Wisconsin,” Underly said. 
Underly was referencing the state’s school voucher programs, which allow students to use public funds to attend participating private schools. Caps on the program, which limit the number of students who can participate, are scheduled to lift after the 2025-26 school year. 
The growth of the state’s school voucher programs coincides with public school districts’ increasing reliance on raising money through property tax hikes that local taxpayers have to decide whether to approve.
“This under-investment has created a growing sense in too many classrooms during too many school board meetings and around too many kitchen tables that our schools are being left to go it alone,” Underly said. 
Underly said the financial pressures are placing teachers and students under other types of stress as well. 
“Our schools are not failing. We are failing our schools, and we can’t afford to keep writing this chapter. If we truly believe in writing a better story for public education, then it’s long past time for our state to step up and deliver on its promise,” Underly said. “When we underfund, we burn out teachers. When we ignore, we lose talent.” 
Underly called attention to the mental health problems that many students are facing, saying that the political environment could be making things worse. She specifically noted the high rates of depression, anxiety and self-harm among LGBTQ+ students, especially transgender students. 
“The debates taking place in the public sphere, and right here in this Capitol building aren’t about sports,” Underly said, referencing bills that have been debated this year that would bar transgender girls from participating on girls’ sports teams. “They’re about something much deeper — whether kids are allowed to belong. It’s not just one group of kids, it’s every kid. It’s the kid who doesn’t know where their next meal is going to come from. It’s the kid growing up in a low-income neighborhood without access to the same opportunities just a few miles away. It’s the kids still learning English like so many generations of Americans before them, navigating a world that too often makes them feel invisible. It’s the rural kid who has big dreams but lacks access to broadband or after-school programs.” 
Undery said that despite the challenges, there is hope for the future of Wisconsin schools. 
“Throughout history, Wisconsin has led the way,” Underly said, noting that the state had the first kindergarten program in the country and created one of the first statewide public library systems. 
“That courage, that commitment to progress, that’s in Wisconsin’s DNA,” Underly said. “Now, we stand at a defining moment. In this next chapter, you re-elected me to lead that work not to maintain the status quo, but to drive real change to lead to act to set a clear path forward, and that’s exactly what I intend to do.” 
She listed priorities including hands-on learning, embracing new technologies, creating personalized learning experiences and recruiting and retaining teachers. She also said DPI is also working to modernize to be a “stronger and more effective partner” to schools and educators.
“The future isn’t red. The future isn’t blue. The future, Wisconsin, is sitting in our classrooms right now, and this is our wake-up call. This is the mirror we must face,” Underly said. “Will we be the generation that looked away as our schools crumbled?

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The federal judge handling former House Speaker Glen Casada’s political corruption case hinted this week that the Franklin Republican could serve more time than his ex-staffer who was sentenced to 30 months in prison.
U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson, who said a lot of things several times during the sentencing of Cade Cothren, told the courtroom that Casada’s sentencing range will be two levels higher because he was a public official. Cothren, in contrast, had stepped down in 2019 from his chief of staff post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal, even if he did influence a public official.
Richardson also said Cothren got about 50% less than he could have based on sentencing guidelines, based in part on letters from supporters.
After being bounced from his $200,000 job, Cothren needed money, and he, Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith hatched a plan to direct business to a shell company Cothren formed, New Mexico-based Phoenix Solutions, that did constituent mailers for lawmakers (Smith called it “low-hanging fruit” in her testimony), before moving on to campaigns and Republican Caucus work. 
Richardson pointed out “it takes two to tango in a case like this,” meaning one couldn’t have done it without the other.

Although the judge said it wasn’t the worst case of honest services fraud he’d ever seen, Richardson called Cothren’s actions “pretty crummy,” “dishonest” and “below” the position of House Speaker chief of staff. He was also convicted of conspiracy and bribery.
The judge gave Cothren some credit for receiving support letters from former Rep. Kent Calfee, Rep. Paul Sherrell and Rep. Todd Warner. 
But even their letters of support came with strings attached. Calfee’s former administrative assistant, Nadine Korby, is the mother of Cothren’s girlfriend. Warner has used another company connected to Cothren, Dixieland Strategies, for campaign work, and a political action committee Cothren formed through an ex-girlfriend, the Faith, Family, Freedom Fund, worked against Warner’s first opponent, incumbent Rep. Rick Tillis. (None of the latter was discussed in court.)
Calfee’s wife, Marilyn, testified in support of Cothren, along with the defendant’s first cousin, Emily Isom.
But Richardson acknowledged that Cothren backers appeared to be wearing “rose-colored glasses” as they spoke glowingly of him.
And even though he acknowledged that Cothren might not have thought he was committing a crime, Richardson still managed to say that Tennesseans could ask the question: “Is this someone’s idea of a joke?”
The judge also continued to bring up the fact that Cothren submitted a “bogus” W-9 form with the signature of “Matthew Phoenix” when the state asked all vendors to turn in federal tax forms.
It’s one of those little points that could stick with a court of appeals when Cothren’s team takes this to another level. The defense requested Cothren be allowed to postpone his prison sentence until the appeal is done. The judge took it under advisement.
But before that, Richardson said the case “has the overall sense that none of this had to happen.” (And why would it, if everything was above board?) The judge said Cothren didn’t have to lie. Nor did he have to misrepresent himself as “Matthew Phoenix” on the W-9.
Richardson also said reasonable people in Tennessee could say “WTH,” meaning, “What the heck.” 
Sorry judge. We understand you can’t say in court what most people have been thinking for six years since Cothren and Casada left their high-ranking posts and then FBI agents raided them. 
No, most people would substitute a different expletive at the end. But you can always recast the phrasing when Casada comes to court this Tuesday.
Backing Hillsdale?
Two gubernatorial candidates, U.S. Rep. John Rose and state Rep. Monty Fritts, are scheduled to participate in a Tennessee Alliance town hall Oct. 18 in Lebanon, where a Hillsdale Classical Education supporter is to speak. U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn is not listed to appear.
Also on the agenda are election integrity, the increase of political Islam in America, sovereignty from a representative of the John Birch Society, the “trouble” that could be coming from schools along with the need to set up Hillsdale College’s Classical Education in Tennessee schools.

Gov. Bill Lee got into a heap of trouble a few years ago when he unveiled plans to put 50 Hillsdale-affiliated schools into the state. Public sentiment against the Michigan-based Christian college grew when the college’s president, Larry Arnn, was secretly recorded at a Franklin event saying teachers are educated in the “dumbest parts of the dumbest colleges in the country.”
Since then, though, the state’s charter commission has approved applications for Classical Education schools in Jackson and Rutherford County. 
Rose’s campaign chairman, Chris Devaney, confirmed the congressman is slated to participate in the gubernatorial forum but declined to say whether he supports Hillsdale-related schools or the other items to be discussed. 
“He is looking forward to answering questions and hearing from this group of freedom loving Tennesseans,” Devaney said.
Fritts, a graduate of conservative Christian Liberty University, said Thursday the forum is on his schedule as well.
He wasn’t clear on Lee’s plans, which changed during public outcry, but he called the items Hillsdale puts out for historical context “prime stuff.”
“I think Hillsdale College does a good job with lots of things,” Fritts said. “They pursue beauty and truth in a classical education.” 
House chairman knocks charter commission override authority

Questions have been raised about Hillsdale’s curriculum for American Classical Education charter schools and whether it downplays the importance of Black Americans’ historical contributions and Martin Luther King’s contention that the force of law should be used to back the civil rights movement.
Hillsdale-affiliated schools use a 1776 curriculum prompted by President Donald Trump to focus on achievements by the nation’s founders and offset a 1619 curriculum that gave the treatment of Black Americans a more central role in American history.
Pizza where?
House Speaker Cameron Sexton recently traveled to Rome where he went to Vatican City and met Pope Leo and gave him a Tennessee Vols football jersey with the number 14, a reference to Leo being the 14th papal Leo.
The trip, which was paid for by the Council of State Governments, included stops to see what he called “amazing history,” the Coliseum, Spanish Steps and the Italian Parliament (only the House side, of course).

— Speaker Cameron Sexton (@CSexton25) September 8, 2025
Sexton said the group also enjoyed some excellent Italian food “off the beaten path” in Florence, but he didn’t exactly give the pizza rave reviews.
Instead, he said he prefers pizza at a Tennessee restaurant that is “very Italianesque.”
“I get it in Crossville, of all places, if you can imagine that,” he said, possibly referring to accusations that he lives in Nashville instead of the town on the Cumberland Plateau.
Regardless, it seems a trip halfway around the world would yield an authentic slice. But we can take solace that a two-hour drive instead of an 11-hour flight will lead us to the world’s best pizza.
No doubt, some Nashville restaurateurs will appeal that ruling.

(Photo by Eros Hoagland/Getty Images)The University of North Carolina System celebrated an important milestone this week with the state’s public universities surpassing more than a quarter of a million students for the first time. The record enrollment of more than 256,000 this fall represents a 3.4% increase over 2024.
The enrollment total is significant. It comes at a time that higher education is facing a demographic challenge caused by falling birth rates in the United States.

North Carolina’s historically black universities saw some of the largest percentage increases this year. Fayetteville State University saw enrollment rise 7.3%, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University was up 6.7%, with North Carolina Central University up 6.8%. Policies raising the enrollment caps for out-of-state students may have helped those HBCUs excel.
Only the University of North Carolina Asheville experienced a decline in enrollment. But officials acknowledged the 6% decline could be related to the ongoing Hurricane Helene recovery. The campus was closed for 33 days last year during the peak season for recruitment and campus tours.
The UNC System also credits the growth in part to policies that simplify the transfer and admissions process. NC College Connect offered automatic admission to more than 62,000 high school seniors with a weighted grade point average of 2.8 or above.
An era of financial uncertainty
In-state undergraduate tuition has not increased in the UNC System for nine straight years. Few states can make that claim.
But on Thursday, UNC Board of Governors Chair Wendy Floyd Murphy indicated that the system would not be able to continue holding tuition rates in place.
“Generous state funding has allowed us to keep tuition low, and we are grateful for the support of our leaders in the North Carolina legislature. Even so, we are now in an era of some financial uncertainty,” said Murphy. “Inflation has driven up the cost of operations at our institutions.
“Universities have absorbed those pressures while holding the line on tuition, but we cannot expect them to continue doing so without negative impacts.”
Murphy said potential budget changes both at the federal and state level mean the system must strengthen financial positions at the campus level.
“After careful consideration, the board will allow our universities to propose modest tuition increases of up to 3% for resident undergraduates,” Murphy said.  “But let me be clear, this doesn’t change our existing policies around college affordability. We’ve guaranteed students that if they graduate in four years, their tuition will not rise.”
Murphy said the system has built faculty teaching workloads to make sure students can earn the credits they need to graduate on time, taking on less debt.

UNC’s fixed tuition guarantee will remain in place for students, and any increases in resident undergraduate tuition will only apply to new students who enroll in the fall of 2026.
The system notes that special fees may be considered, but only to cover inflationary costs for existing academic programs, or to pay for new programs approved by the Board of Governors.
North Carolina Promise Institutions — Elizabeth City State, Fayetteville State, UNC Pembroke and Western Carolina — will continue to offer reduced resident tuition rates set by the state legislature.
Murphy stressed that the tuition increase will not be automatic. Campuses will be required to develop proposals with input from their communities and boards of trustees and have their proposals reviewed by the system’s Board of Governors in February 2026.
“Going forward, we will be judicious. We simply acknowledge the reality of rising cost and the need to protect our institutions, preserve quality of instruction and ensure student success.”

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


A program aimed at increasing the number of biomedical researchers from underrepresented groups fell victim to the Trump administration’s attacks on diversity this spring.
The Initiative for Maximizing Student Development at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, begun in 2009, had been budgeted $712,108 this fiscal year, according to a website that tracks National Institutes of Health grant terminations. The IMSD program had received $273,558 when NIH terminated the grant in April, according to the website.
A separate National Institutes of Health report shows the project principals received $379,791 in fiscal 2024 and $332,317 this fiscal year.
The grant was one of eight at UAMS that NIH shut down because language in the grant descriptions contained words indicating they might be used to advance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. This included an apparently purely scientific cancer research grant that contained the phrase “trans” in its project description; the tagged word was “translocation.”

Medical school spokesperson Leslie Taylor said by email that, “had they run their entire grant cycle, the loss would have been about $5.5 million.”
“The projects that were funded by the terminated grants have to be shut down because we must maintain compliance with federal initiatives,” Taylor said. “If researchers have funding for different projects, they can possibly move personnel to other funded projects when appropriate.” 
Regarding the IMSD grant, she said it was hard to know what extent its shutdown would have on other research because the program “funded graduate students who went on to join labs at UAMS working on various areas of research. Without the IMSD, we can’t admit those additional students, which would impact how many students are available to join our research programs.”
The National Institutes of Health began cancelling grants this spring after a January presidential executive order demanded the end of any programs or grants addressing diversity, equity and inclusion issues. A federal judge ordered a halt to the grant cancellations, but the U.S. Supreme Court in August said the government could proceed to formally terminate $783 million in NIH funding.
The grants to UAMS and other Arkansas institutions were in various stages of funding, according to the grant-tracking website.
A $1.25 million NIH grant to University of Arkansas researchers, for example, was titled “STEAM Education and Training for Underrepresented Students and Teachers in the Arkansas Delta.” When the study was canceled in May, all but $482,257 had been disbursed, according to university public information officer Rebecca Morrison. 
The Arkansas Cancer Coalition’s $1.12 million NIH grant aimed to help it develop strategies for reducing cancer and chronic disease in the Arkansas Delta by helping people travel to screening opportunities, according to the grant application abstract. At the time the grant was canceled, the coalition had received $573,304, according to the grant-tracking website. Coalition officials could not be reached for comment.
Among the canceled research projects at UAMS was a $3 million grant to study the utilization of health services among older Black men and whether a universal basic income of $500 a month would improve health outcomes for that population, according to the project description on the NIH website.
The grant terminations haven’t diminished UAMS’ ability to attract major research funds from NIH. Since March, the state medical school has announced more than $12 million in grants for continued cancer research: nearly $3 million to study DNA structures that might affect cancer treatment, $3.4 million to study a virus linked to some cancers that evades the immune system, and $5.8 million to continue studying cancer treatment side effects.
In addition to NIH, the National Science Foundation also canceled eight grants to University of Arkansas researchers worth about $6 million, according to figures provided by Morrison, the university PIO.
UALR received an NSF grant of $269,860 that provided research experiences for undergraduates. Vice Provost of Research Brian Berry said the program was over by the time the grant was canceled, “so there was no impact.” 
A similar situation occurred at the UA Fayetteville campus, according to figures from Morrison.

(Photos by West Virginia Department of Health and Kristian Thacker)The state of West Virginia has pushed back closing on the sale of its four long-term facilities to Oct. 31. The hospitals, many of which are deteriorating, typically serve elderly patients using Medicaid. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey is selling hospitals in Beckley, Fairmont, Terra Alta and West Columbia to New York-based Marx Development Group for $60 million. Together the facilities are licensed for about 500 beds. 
Majestic Care, a subsidiary of MDG, will operate the facilities in West Virginia. 
“While the Department of Health Facilities, MDG and Majestic Care were hopeful that the transaction could be completed by Sept. 30, 2025, all parties understood that it might not be possible to accomplish the extensive and necessary tasks for a complete closing and transition of operations by that date,” DoHF Communications Director Gailyn M. Markham said. 
“This additional time will allow the parties to ensure a seamless transition of operations, employees, and residents, all of which remain top priorities for all parties,” she said.
There is a pending lawsuit, brought by a Democratic state senator on behalf of a patient, that seeks to stop the sale of John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont. A notice of suit said the sale was unlawful without the Legislature’s approval. Markham didn’t cite the lawsuit in its reason for the delay.
The four state-owned hospitals often house and take care of elderly patients — some with complex medical problems and disabilities — who have nowhere else to go. Many patients rely on Medicaid and can’t afford private care.
Morrisey has said the private company will make “significant investments” in the state and improve the level of health care. All of the facilities are operating at a financial loss to the state and need millions of dollars in repairs. MDG has agreed to build three to five new facilities to replace aging facilities though the locations are undetermined.
The governor’s office hasn’t yet released any records related to the sale, which was originally supposed to close at the end of this month. In response to a Freedom of Information Act Request, an attorney in the governor’s office said non-exempt documents will be shared Sept. 26.
Morrisey has also promised that the private company will retain patients and staff. The state has been heavily reliant on contract nurses to staff state-owned hospitals. 
Earlier this month, letters were sent out to state hospital employees asking them to indicate if they will apply for a position with MDG, explore retirement options or resign from their position with the state. Hospital employees shared the letter with West Virginia Watch. 
The state Department of Health Facilities confirmed a letter was sent. 
“As the DHF long term care facilities transition to new ownership under Marx Development Group (MDG), which will be operated by Majestic Care, our priority is to ensure employees are supported and that their preferences are respected throughout the process,” Markham wrote in an email. 
“MDG, and Majestic Care, have made it clear that current staff will be offered opportunities to continue their employment post-transition in addition to career pathways and training designed to help staff grow,” she added. 
Residents in Majestic Care’s nursing homes in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana receive around an hour less nursing care per day on average than residents at the state’s four hospitals, according to federal health agency reports and reported by Mountain State Spotlight. 
Majestic officials told the news outlet that the company meets all state and federal staffing requirements and that it offers competitive pay and benefits. 
Senate president wants to protect hospital employees’ pensions 
The company will offer private insurance, and 322 state employees at the four hospitals are insured through the state’s Public Employee Insurance Agency. A spokesperson for Morrisey said that “their removal from the PEIA system will not have a significant impact” on the financially troubled insurance program. 
Hopemont Hospital, one of the facilities being sold, is in the district of Senate President Randy Smith. 
“Most of the correspondence I’m getting is from people there at the hospital over their retirement,” he said on Thursday. “My concern is these employees that are close to retirement, or you know, or are invested to make sure that you know they’re protected, because it’s nothing to do with their fault.”
Smith is considering legislation to ensure state employees affected by the sale can retain their pensions. He has requested data from DoHF about the numbers of employees that are within a few years of retirement, he said.  
He’d like to see a special legislative session this fall to deal with the issue. 
“I’ve talked to several legislators, and you know they’re in agreement with me — it’s only fair to make sure that these people’s pensions are protected,” he said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Universities of Wisconsin faculty and staff employees seeking a voice in UW operations have gained the ears of a number of UW regents, a union leader said Thursday, and want their request for recognition put on the Board of Regents agenda in October.
In March, American Federation of Teachers/Wisconsin leaders had hoped to confront the regents with their campaign to give faculty and staff employees a voice. Their efforts to meet in person then were thwarted.
AFT/Wisconsin’s immediate aim is to gain an agreement from the regents that would enable the union and university management to “meet and confer” over compensation and working conditions for faculty and academic staff in a non-binding process.
AFT/Wisconsin President Jon Shelton said Thursday that “a lot has happened” to advance the union’s goals since the March demonstration.
“We’ve started to have some really productive conversations with a number of individual regents,” Shelton told the Wisconsin Examiner just before a rally outside the University of Wisconsin-Madison building where the regents were meeting Thursday.
“We’d really like to see a meet-and-confer policy on the agenda in the Board of Regents’ October meeting,” said Shelton, a professor at the UW-Green Bay. “We’ve communicated that to the Board of Regents and feel like we’re really making progress.”
The rally preceded a silent demonstration at the start of the regents’ meeting Thursday in the Gordon Dining and Event Center on the UW-Madison campus.
A couple of dozen union members and supporters took seats in the meeting room in the 20 minutes or so before the meeting started at 1 p.m. They sat silently during the opening remarks, which started with an admonition from Board President Amy Bogost that any disruption “will be handled swiftly with responsible individuals subject to disciplinary action and/or citations for the disruption.”
At about 2 minutes into the meeting, the union group stood and silently walked out when Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman spoke to address the regents.
The campaign for union recognition took shape two years ago at a summit by faculty and campus advocates seeking “to do something about the diminishing conditions in the education system,” Shelton said at the rally before the meeting.
“And one of the things that we decided to do that day was to push for union recognition in the education system,” he said. “And for too long our voices as workers had been ignored by administration after administration after administration on campuses across the education system.”
A university system spokesman said Thursday that campuses rely on shared governance for faculty and staff input.
“Leadership at our universities and at the Universities of Wisconsin Administration meet regularly with shared governance groups to consult on a wide range of matters,” said Mark Pitsch, director of media relations for the Universities of Wisconsin. “These shared governance groups are authorized by state statute and regent policy as the official, elected bodies to represent faculty and staff.”
Campus union leaders contend, however, the shared governance system is ineffectual.
Speaking at the rally before the regents’ meeting, Lauren Gantz, an English professor at UW-Stevens Point, said there has been “very little discussion in shared governance” to work out details of a partnership with another college, and “no real concern for the working conditions of our faculty and academic staff” in the arrangement.
Gantz, who is co-president of an AFT faculty and staff union at UW-Stevens Point, said in an interview that among the top issues for faculty and staff seeking union representation was workload.
“We’ve lost a lot of personnel, both faculty and academic and university staff,” Gantz said. “We’ve had repeated discussions about the burnout conditions on our campus, and we’d like to be able to actually take some concrete steps to deal with that rather than slapping a Band-Aid on things.”
A rally speaker, Stephanie Spehar, former president of the faculty and staff union at the UW Oshkosh, said that when the university was confronted with a deficit of $18 million in 2023, “our administration did not consult with any of us workers” about how to address the deficit. “If they had done that, if we had meet and confer, I think we would have had very different outcomes,” she said.
Shelton said in an interview the union’s meet-and-confer proposal includes provisions that would require the union to demonstrate support from 35% of an individual university’s faculty and staff on a petition or a total of 500 people.
“This is not like some small minority of people who are pushing for this,” he said.
The union is asking for meet-and-confer discussion because collective bargaining is currently off limits as a result of the 2011 law known as Act 10, stripping most public employees in Wisconsin of most union rights. Although the law is now the subject of a lawsuit and a Dane County circuit court judge found it unconstitutional, the law remains in effect while the case is appealed.
The meet-and-confer is just a first step, however, Shelton told the rally. “And then next year, it’s flipping the Legislature” from a Republican majority to a Democratic one “and pushing for a collective bargaining bill in the UW system,” he said. “Because every single worker deserves to have a seat at the table and collective bargaining.”

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, arrives before Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testifies before a U.S. Senate Finance Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on June 12, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Safe and affordable housing is out of reach for too many Idaho families, and we all pay the price when rents are too high. 
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, is working to alleviate these housing challenges through the introduction of the Renewing Opportunity in the American Dream (ROAD) to Housing Act. This bipartisan package includes long-term policy solutions that are needed to address our state’s housing challenges – including more than 40 provisions aimed at cutting red tape to access federal housing assistance, building more homes, and updating outdated programs. 
Rents are unaffordable for the average Idaho renter. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s 2025 Out of Reach Report, an Idaho renter needs to earn nearly $28 an hour to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment, and renters living in the Boise area must earn $35 an hour. However, the average Idaho renter only earns $19 an hour – indicating a significant gap between Idaho wages and Idaho rents. For a minimum-wage worker earning $7.25 an hour, that means clocking more than 150 hours a week – essentially four full-time jobs – just to keep a roof above their family’s heads.  
School disruption is a significant – and overlooked – impact of housing loss for Idaho kids

In addition to Idaho’s high rents, our state is also experiencing a shortage of nearly 25,000  affordable and available homes for renters with low incomes. A home is affordable when a family spends no more than 30 percent of their household income on housing. 
That means almost 25,000 Idaho families are paying more than they can afford on rent and likely only one emergency expense away from facing eviction. These families must also make tough choices every month between paying for rent, nutritious food, health care, school supplies, gas, and other basic necessities. 
The ROAD to Housing Act of 2025 aims to alleviate these barriers by offering long-term policy solutions that strengthen our housing system for the future. It’s a chance to make progress on the housing challenges Idaho faces by creating stability, expanding opportunity, and ensuring families have a path to affordable and stable homes. 
It creates an annual fund to help states and cities reform zoning laws, encourage smaller homes like duplexes and backyard apartments, and tackle the roadblocks that stop new housing from being built. It also strengthens Housing and Urban Development programs with funding for repairs to aging homes, streamlined housing vouchers, and expanded support for rural communities, veterans, and people experiencing homelessness. 
Housing is about more than four walls. When families have a safe, affordable place to live, kids do better in school, parents can focus on work, and low-income households can begin to build stability instead of falling further behind. Strong housing policy also strengthens local economies; businesses thrive when workers can afford to live nearby and take the jobs they’re trained for. 
As of Aug. 1, 2025, the Road to Housing Act of 2025 passed the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. It is now on track for consideration by the full Senate.

Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, speaks into the microphone at his first game as LSU's public address announcer. (Courtesy of Dixon McMakin) Dixon McMakin, the new public address announcer at LSU’s Tiger Stadium, has a complex relationship with the state’s flagship university. 
Son of 1970s LSU baseball star Wally McMakin, he is undoubtedly an LSU sports fanatic. But as an attorney, he has sued the school. And as a legislator, he has leaned hard on the university, even publicly joking about cutting its budget. 
McMakin, a 39-year-old Republican, has represented House District 68 in the Louisiana Legislature since January 2024. He’s also a financial adviser, insurance broker and an attorney who isn’t afraid to take on his alma mater. 
In addition to taking over this year from Dan Borne as the Voice of Tiger Stadium, McMakin is the radio play-by-play commentator for Catholic High football. He has worked as a public address announcer for LSU volleyball and softball games since 2020. 
He is paid for his PA work but does not have a contract with the university, McMakin said in an interview with the Illuminator and Tiger Rag. LSU athletics spokesman Zach Greenwell said McMakin is paid $125 per game. 
“This was not a political pick,” McMakin said of his receiving the Tiger Stadium announcer’s job. “I just happened to be a guy that was elected when I got picked.” 
He is undoubtedly a Baton Rouge boy, born to one icon and stepson to another, retired longtime WBRZ-TV news anchor Andrea Clesi McMakin. 
McMakin got his undergraduate, MBA and law degrees from LSU, where he was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. His wife, Bess Casserleigh, a WBRZ anchor, is one of the most visible women in the city. 
Behind his purple and gold exterior, Tiger Stadium’s new announcer is also among the most conservative legislators at the Capitol and at times a vocal critic of the state’s flagship university. 
“Any critique comes from a great admiration and love more than anything else,” McMakin said of his alma mater.

Full-court press
Before his Sept. 6 debut in Tiger Stadium for Louisiana Tech vs. LSU, McMakin’s voice rose to prominence in a Baton Rouge courtroom. 
In the 2022 lawsuit McMakin v. LSU, he sued the university to obtain records for Donald Abels, a former LSU Greek Life official accused of using fake social media profiles in 2019 to entrap underage fraternity recruits in underage drinking. Because no laws were broken, LSU handled the matter internally. Abels, who denied the accusations, faced no repercussions and left the school in 2021.
The decision against McMakin set a precedent the university has used to swat down similar requests for its personnel records. Having his name associated with closing off public records didn’t sit right with McMakin, who has a mixed voting record on open government issues but has generally been an advocate for government transparency. 
McMakin’s first goal after being elected was to undo that precedent and get the records he wanted. He quickly filed legislation to remove privacy protections over personnel records for all public employees in Louisiana. His proposal, which lawmakers approved overwhelmingly, would have undermined court decisions that put up significant roadblocks for records related to investigations into public employee misconduct. 
Gov. Jeff Landry vetoed the bill, citing concerns over revealing “sensitive information” such as payroll deductions, prescription medications and emergency contacts. 
Despite the setback, McMakin’s occasional crusades on behalf of LSU students have continued. 
McMakin was among the legislators who intervened this past spring on behalf of an LSU student government presidential ticket whose campaign was disqualified twice. The candidates, former state Senate student workers Alex Foret and Isabelle Tatman, were first accused of bribery and then campaign finance violations. The student-led University Court added their names back to the ballot in both instances, but they ultimately lost the election. 
McMakin has also criticized the university’s protection of the LSU Campus Mounds, believed to be among the oldest manmade structures in the United States. The mounds are also considered to be culturally significant, having been built by Native Americans thousands of years ago. 
Before fences were erected to protect the mounds, they had been worn down by pedestrians and tailgaters. 
McMakin has posted on social media numerous times, calling on LSU to “tear down the fence,” even threatening earlier this year to cut the university’s budget, remarks which he characterized as tongue in cheek in an interview. 
“It’s all built on the idea that I want the flagship university to be the very best and look the very best at everything,” McMakin said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Laughing as a legislator 
State lawmakers on both sides of the aisle interviewed for this report described McMakin as an incredibly personable lawmaker with an unrelenting sense of humor. 
“He makes me laugh all the time,” Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, said of McMakin, who he sits next to on the House floor. 
Riser and McMakin both filed legislation earlier this year to subsidize college athletics. 
Riser’s bill, which passed, will allow all Division I athletic programs in Louisiana to receive an estimated $2 million in taxpayer dollars annually from sports gambling tax revenue. While fairly insignificant to a major college power such as LSU, the money will go a long way for the state’s smaller D1 schools.   
McMakin’s bill would have exempted athlete name, image and likeness income from state taxes. It failed to gain the needed support, with opponents disliking the optics of giving a tax break to highly compensated college athletes while increasing sales taxes for most citizens. 
McMakin said he is considering bringing the bill back next year. 
His other legislative interests have varied. McMakin’s voting record is extremely conservative, even for his right-of-center district. But that has made him a key ally of Landry and increased his influence in the Republican supermajority legislature. 
The flashiest of his conservative proposals, such as calling a constitutional convention or phasing out the individual income tax, have largely stalled. Other Republican staples, such as restricting panhandling or forbidding people without legal status in the United States from obtaining a Louisiana driver’s license, have fared better. 
McMakin has also had several successful proposals with no partisan tint, including a new law that prohibits universities from charging their student media outlets for public records. It passed the legislature unanimously before earning Landry’s signature. 
Those who have noticed McMakin’s joking flair as an announcer at LSU games have keyed in on it as a central theme in all of his professional endeavors. 
“He does go down there and is really loud and tries to be funny,” Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, said of McMakin’s House floor speeches. “That’s his personality, kind of clowning, not in a negative way.” 
McMakin once pantomimed holding a horse’s reins, trotting back and forth behind a legislator presenting a bill on the horse racing industry.
While some of his peers consider his style at the Capitol to be humorous, they note that he knows when to turn it off. 
For instance, McMakin used his booming voice to rage against the pharmacy chain CVS Health, which sent text messages to state employees threatening to shut down its pharmacies in Louisiana if lawmakers approved a bill regulating pharmacy benefit managers. The “middlemen” companies oversee prescription drug programs for insurance companies and large employers, including the state of Louisiana.   
“Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,” McMakin said in a House speech on the final day of the legislative session. Lawmakers declined to bring the bill up for a vote. 
McMakin is not the only legislator to take on a big role at a university they represent, though he will certainly be the most high profile. 
State law prohibits individuals from being employed or holding office in two separate branches of government, though some have held legislative seats and worked in higher education, which falls under the executive branch. State Rep. Barbara Carpenter, D-Baton Rouge, is currently the dean of international education at Southern University and also represents the university in the legislature. This dual office-holding has typically gone unchallenged. 
Political observers have noted the possibility of conflicts of interests in these situations requires these legislators to walk a tighter rope. McMakin’s first opportunity to demonstrate how he’ll handle his split allegiances will come when the legislature convenes in March. 
“Anything I’ve ever said or done for LSU was to try to make it better, to compete with the other flagships,” he added.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/McMakin-hz-1024x594.jpg,,,2025-09-19 06:57:09.347029

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)I got a surprise phone call last week from the other side of the world, where an American expatriate was worried about the future of his country in the wake of the Charlie Kirk assassination. We agreed that the dis-United States of America needs calming voices who can command attention — a tall order in a media landscape that is dominated by sources that are provocative, inflammatory and often false. All of us need to help change that.
American public discourse is now driven by opinion, not by facts, largely because of social-media platforms that favor opinion and use secret algorithms that promote the most provocative views to compete in the new “attention economy.” The decline of the traditional news business reflects the reality that the market for fact has shrunk while the market for opinion has grown. Americans prefer to be entertained, and have their views confirmed, than be informed — especially by facts that might conflict with those views.
So, what can we agree on? I would like to think that virtually all Americans agree that political violence is never justified, and that the vast majority of us would probably say likewise about speech that advocates political violence. There are laws against such things.
What, then, about speech that celebrates political violence, even a crime that results in death? That sort of speech, however repugnant, has been protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. But now people are getting fired for callous things they said about Charlie Kirk’s death, and President Trump and his top lieutenants are using the assassination to more deeply demonize and outright threaten their political opponents.
“Mourn him respectfully or suffer the consequences,” as the Reuters news service described the approach. Ironically, Kirk, who had plenty of controversial views, was lauded most as a champion of free speech; now his friends and allies are using his death to suppress speech — and maybe more.
“There is no civility in the celebration of political assassination,” Vice President JD Vance said Monday, alleging “leftist” funding of “terrorist sympathizers” and urging his audience to call employers of those who’ve made comments they find objectionable.
Trump said without evidence, “We have some pretty radical groups and they got away with murder.” Lexington businessman Nate Morris, who began his Senate campaign with a Kirk-hosted rally and wants Trump’s endorsement, was on the same page, telling Breitbart News that the “radical left has blood on their hands.”
Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, said the government will use its power to take liberal groups’ money and power “and, if you’ve broken the law, to take away your freedom.” Miller recently said that the Democratic Party is not a political party but “a domestic extremist organization . . . exclusively dedicated to protecting terrorists, criminals, gang-bangers and murderers.”

That’s ridiculous, but it sets the stage for the government to go after the opposing party, and that’s the sort of thing my expatriate friend and I worry about. Trump clearly revels in the exercise of power, and has indicated no interest in using the power of his office to cool the conversation, as Utah Gov. Spencer Cox tried to do. But some Republicans wish Trump would.
On KET’s “Kentucky Tonight” Monday night, Kentucky Republican strategist Amy Wickliffe said political leaders, from the White House on down, need to call for “taking the rhetoric down.” She acknowledged that’s “really hard” to do with “people in your sphere,” but “Where we go from here, it’s on us. It’s on all of us.”
The maxim, “All that is necessary for evil to prevail is for good men and women to do nothing,” is not as operative as it was in the old media environment, when extreme voices had little access to mass audiences. Now, the extremes are amplified in huge echo chambers, and many Americans in the middle have dropped out of the toxic talk. The fact that flags went to half-staff for the death of a political activist who was unknown to many if not most Americans shows how our political tribes live in different realities.
Perhaps the best place for good women and men to do something about the current crisis is not on social media, but face to face, one on one and in small groups — where there is at least a modicum of trust and respect.
Cox, the Utah governor, said we should “log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in your community.” At a local philanthropic event in my hometown of Albany last weekend, I told a friend that everyone has a civic responsibility to improve the community where they live. Now, technology has made us part of a national community that needs improving, and we all have a role to play.

(Photo by John Gray/Verite News)Current and former detainees at the South Louisiana ICE Detention Center in Basile have filed multiple complaints through immigration rights groups Monday against the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging repeated sexual harassment, sexual abuse, physical abuse, coerced labor and neglect of urgent medical and mental health care at the facility.
Three organizations, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the ACLU of Louisiana and the National Immigration Project filed the complaints on behalf of four people — two who have been deported and two individuals who remain in custody at the facility, but who are in imminent risk of deportation, according to Sarah Decker, a staff attorney with RFK Human Rights. One of the deported individuals has since reentered the country and is now in criminal custody, Decker said.
The complaints allege that a former assistant warden, Manuel Reyes, at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center repeatedly sexually abused, threatened and punished one of the complainants, who is referred to as “Jane Doe” by her attorneys. The complaints further allege that Reyes ran an off-the-books late-night work scheme that coerced transgender detainees into physically and psychologically painful labor. Reyes could not be reached for comment.
“What’s particularly jarring about these cases is that these clients screamed for help,” said Decker, who filed the complaints with DHS and ICE. “They filed grievances. They filed [Prison Rape Elimination Act] complaints. They called the [Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General] hotline. They spoke to ICE officers face-to-face and told them what was happening. So this was an open secret in the facility, and ICE definitely knew about this.”
Attorneys for the plaintiffs filed claims of personal injury against DHS and ICE, seeking financial compensation, on behalf of their clients. Separately they filed a civil rights complaint with offices at DHS. The Southeast Dignity Not Detention Coalition joined the other legal groups in filing the civil complaint.

Decker said that while Reyes is central to the complaints, she believes the problems at detention facilities like the one in Basile go much deeper.
“There’s much more going on than even we as advocates who represent people know about. There’s a deep underbelly of abuse that we haven’t fully uncovered yet,” she said.
The South Louisiana ICE Processing Center is, like many ICE facilities, run by an outside contractor — the GEO Group, a multinational private prison corporation and ICE’s largest detention contractor. The GEO Group has repeatedly faced allegations of negligence and abuse at the immigration facilities it oversees. The company did not respond to requests for comment on the newest complaints.
Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, responded on behalf of DHS and ICE, calling the accusations false, characterizing them as a “hoax.” McLaughlin said the assistant warden did not perpetrate or enable sexual harassment or assault and that no one was forced into coerced labor or physically abused.
“The media is clearly desperate for these allegations of inhumane conditions at this facility to be true,” McLaughlin wrote. “All of these allegations are investigated by (the) ICE Office of Professional Responsibility, and none were found to be true.”
Decker disagreed with McLaughlin’s categorization of the incidents in the complaints.
“The documentation that we’ve done for years at these facilities and the stories of these clients prove otherwise, and it’s not surprising that DHS is once again failing to take accountability for the mistreatment and abuse of those entrusted to their care,” she said.
McLaughlin also said that ICE detainees receive proper meals and medical treatment.
“This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives,” she said.
A couple fled Russia to seek asylum in the US. They’ve been kept apart for a year.

Decker pointed to the results of a 2024 ACLU study, in which medical experts reviewed records for 52 of 53 reported deaths in ICE custody from 2017 to 2021. They found that of those 52 people, roughly 95% were “preventable or possibly preventable,” had appropriate medical care been provided.
“The assertion that people in ICE custody are receiving high quality medical care is simply false,” Decker said. “What we’ve found is the exact opposite, that the medical care at these facilities is so poor and so abusive that people are dying in government custody and are suffering from life threatening and potentially permanent medical consequences as a result of this mistreatment.”
The woman identified as Jane Doe is from the Dominican Republic and lived in Maryland for 10 years, according to the complaint. She landed in the Basile ICE center by way of the women’s Federal Correctional Institution in Aliceville, Alabama, according to her lawyer.
The woman’s complaint says that she suffers from epilepsy, and it alleges that she was first sexually harassed and then finally repeatedly sexually abused at the detention center. It also states that she was denied medical attention and put in solitary confinement and threatened. Decker said those threats are central to why the woman identified as Jane Doe wants to remain anonymous. As her abuse in the facility continued, Doe’s physical health deteriorated, the complaint states.
“I begged the U.S. government to help me,” the woman identified as Jane Doe said in a press statement. “I filed complaints and grievances. I told ICE officers and medical staff. But they did nothing. I want people to know what happened to me and what continues to happen to people detained in these facilities.”
Three transgender detainees were also subject to physical and psychological abuse, according to their individual complaints.
One complainant, Mexican national Monica Renteria-Gonzalez, who was still in ICE custody as of this week, is a transgender man. The South Louisiana ICE Processing Center is used primarily to hold women, but ICE assigns people to detention centers based upon their sex assigned at birth instead of their gender identity. Renteria-Gonzalez has been detained since roughly May 2023 at the facility, according to his complaint. Renteria-Gonzalez began working during the late-night hours alongside other transgender people for as little as $1 per day, the complaint states.
Renteria-Gonzalez’ complaint details difficult manual labor, allegedly without protective equipment, resulting in physical injury.
“Our rights are being violated everyday. This is a privately run facility that profits from our suffering. They are using us to make a profit but denying us medical care, food, even the most basic things like proper clothes and mattresses,” Renteria-Gonzalez said in a press release.
Two other transgender people detained at the facility — Mario Luisa Garcia-Valenzuela, a transgender man who is still in custody, and Kenia Campos-Flores, a nonbinary/transgender person who is no longer at the facility — had similar allegations in their complaints.
The complaints also allege that solitary confinement was used against the detainees as a means of punishment for complaints they issued about the behavior of the people running the facility.
The civil rights complaint filed with DHS is calling for the release of the detainees mentioned in the complaint, a full investigation of the allegations and financial penalties for GEO Group, should wrongdoing and mismanagement be found, as well as the termination of the contract with GEO to run the facility.
“These facilities are incapable of housing people humanely, and there’s no solution outside of shutting down these facilities and ending the use of immigration detention,” Decker said.

(Pixabay/Creative Commons license)Virginia’s fledgling seed-to-sale tracking system has only been online for two months, but it is already painting the clearest picture yet of the state’s medical cannabis market, data released this week shows.
Operated by the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority (CCA) and run through the private vendor Metrc, the system monitors every plant, product and sale in real time — a first for the commonwealth. Between July and August, the platform logged 17,786 plants harvested, nearly $30 million in sales and more than 256,000 transactions.
“This system gives us a clear, real-time view of medical cannabis across Virginia,” said Jamie Patten, acting head and chief administrative officer of the CCA. “We can see which products are popular, track plant growth, and understand sales trends. That information helps us protect patients, prevent illegal products from entering the market, and make smart decisions for the program’s future.”
The tracking system’s early data offers a snapshot of what patients are buying. Nearly half of sales were flower, or cannabis buds, while concentrates made up 32% of purchases. Infused edibles accounted for 15%, and shake trim — the loose leaf material left after flower processing — represented 5%.
State regulators say these insights can guide oversight and improve transparency in a program that has faced persistent complaints from patients. Licensed processors must use the Metrc platform, which officials argue ensures only tested, regulated cannabis reaches consumers.
The CCA plans to build on the rollout by creating a public dashboard where Virginians can view product and sales data themselves.
The numbers arrive as patients continue to raise concerns about affordability and access. A 2024 survey conducted by the Virginia Medical Cannabis Coalition found that a majority of patients felt prices were too high and options too limited. Some respondents reported traveling to Washington, D.C., or Maryland to obtain cheaper products.
Similarly, public feedback collected by the state last year highlighted frustrations with wait times, product variety and affordability. One patient told WVTF Public Radio they paid nearly twice as much in Virginia compared with neighboring states, while others described the program as confusing and overly restrictive.
CCA leaders have said that increased transparency and tighter oversight could help stabilize the market, though they acknowledge that structural challenges remain.
Virginia’s Medical Cannabis Program allows qualified patients to legally access state-regulated cannabis products, provided they receive a written certification from a licensed medical practitioner, such as a physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice nurse.
Patients must be residents of Virginia, at least 18 years old (though parents or legal guardians can certify for minors or vulnerable adults), and have a condition that their practitioner believes may benefit from use of cannabis. 
Once they have the certification, they may purchase medical cannabis from licensed dispensaries; the law no longer requires patients to register with the state Board of Pharmacy in order to access the program — a change that took effect in July 2022.
The certification must be renewed annually unless the practitioner specifies a shorter validity period. All medical cannabis sold in the program is produced by state-licensed processors, tested, and regulated under oversight by the CCA to ensure safety, transparency and adherence to legal standards.
The unveiling of the CCA’s seed-to-sale system also comes against the backdrop of a broader debate at the General Assembly — whether to allow recreational cannabis sales. Lawmakers legalized simple possession in 2021 but never finalized a retail market, leaving medical cannabis the only regulated option for consumers.
This summer, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission heard multiple proposals outlining potential frameworks for recreational sales, including timelines, tax structures and licensing options. Experts warned that without a legal retail system, Virginians will continue to turn to unregulated markets and out-of-state dispensaries. 
Legislators are weighing whether to introduce a retail system as early as 2026, though political divisions remain.
The push follows the creation of a new Joint Cannabis Commission, which began meeting in July to study retail models and prepare legislation. Advocates argue that Virginia’s medical cannabis system, now strengthened by the Metrc tracking platform, could serve as a foundation for broader regulation if the legislature moves forward.
For now, the CCA says its focus remains on refining the medical program and ensuring public safety. The seed-to-sale platform allows regulators to trace products from cultivation through distribution, reducing the risk of diversion or contamination.
Officials did not specify when the public dashboard would launch, but they emphasized it would give patients and lawmakers alike clearer insight into how the market is functioning.

RICHMOND, Va. – The number of identified human trafficking cases last year in Virginia was its highest since 2018, although officials believe this could be attributed to better identification and reporting channels.
Two hundred and twenty-eight cases of human trafficking were identified in the state in 2024, according to data released by the National Human Trafficking Hotline. That number was 199 in 2018.
The National Human Trafficking Hotline received 661 signals, or tips, for the state last year. Human trafficking victims submitted 112. That is a nearly 29% jump from the prior year, which saw 513 tips.
Dr. Fidelma Rigby, a professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at VCU Health, hopes the higher number of identified human trafficking cases is due to an increase in community awareness of the signs of human trafficking.
Rigby teaches an elective at Virginia Commonwealth University that gives medical students tools to identify signs of human trafficking in their patients.
More resources for young runaways, those with mental health struggles and the LGBTQ+ community could help potential trafficking victims avoid being targeted, according to Rigby. The low self esteem of many victims contributes to their vulnerability to being groomed by human traffickers.
People who escaped trafficking require a different set of resources to help them recover from their ordeal, Rigby said. Victims have a lack of safe spaces to recuperate in.
“The trouble is that you need a lot more time when you’re taking someone out of a trafficking situation to give them a place to recover,” Rigby said. “So it usually takes at least a year, once they come out of that trafficking situation, to be able to safely release them into the community.”
The Virginia State Police received 1,209 trafficking tips as of Sept. 12, according to an agency release.
That number is trending slightly higher than last year, according to Robin Lawson, a Virginia State Police spokesperson.
The Virginia State Police campaign to raise awareness of human trafficking may have contributed to the uptick in reports, Lawson said. Citizens should call the Virginia State Police human trafficking tip line if they see something suspicious, and Lawson noted the tip line also takes calls from trafficking victims.
“The greatest weapon we have in this is … raising awareness and breaking down misconceptions and making sure that people aren’t afraid to report a concern,” Lawson said. “Or even with victims, so that they feel comfortable in being able to reach out to someone and get information or express their concern about their particular situation.”
Changes in behavior and indicators of physical abuse or malnourishment are signs someone may be being trafficked. College students are vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers because of financial strain and lack of their usual support system. Trafficking takes a variety of forms that are not always obvious, such as labor trafficking, according to Lawson.
“The exploitation is done through not just force,” Lawson said. “It can be through intimidation and deception. So it’s a difficult crime to identify in many cases.”
Patrick McKenna, a lawyer and cofounder of Virginia Coalition Against Human Trafficking, said the group pushes for reforms and legislation to reduce the legal barriers faced by trafficking survivors.
“The last 20 years is attempting to get the legislature and the governor, whoever, to come to the table to create legislation that would help facilitate not only the freeing of survivors and removal of barriers, but also bring to bear the resources of the justice system against those who are doing the victimization,” McKenna said.
Many human trafficking victims are forced to commit crimes because they are under duress, such as experiencing a substance use disorder, according to McKenna. This opens them up to legal charges and incarceration in a criminal justice system that does not always recognize the signs of human trafficking, according to McKenna.
“While I was still executive director, we were given the opportunity to go into local jail facilities here in the Hampton Roads area,” McKenna said. “As a result, we were identifying many women who are sitting in jail who have been trafficked.”

The coalition successfully advocated for a bill that dropped charges, such as felony drug possession, from a victim’s record. It hopes to broaden the list of eligible charges to include all nonviolent felonies, but has faced pushback from some law enforcement and prosecutors.
There is concern such a law would allow for a torrent of false claims, McKenna said.
The coalition is addressing such concerns by deconstructing misconceptions about human trafficking.
“It’s kind of like reflipping, reorganizing, re-educating, and getting people to see the old way does not work,” McKenna said. “It’s ineffective and [it] takes too much time and resources and at the end of the day survivors stay stuck, you don’t get the prosecution, and where are we?”
Everyone can play a part in fighting human trafficking and the most seemingly insignificant actions can create positive change, according to McKenna.
“Don’t minimize the impact you can have by doing even just one thing,” McKenna said.

Virginia’s proposed extension of Beltway toll lanes into Maryland won’t solve our mobility crisis

First, the Interstate 495/270 widening project is not “Virginia’s project,” but was spawned by former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan after he was elected in 2014. The Beltway and I-270 in Montgomery County are heavily congested because of insufficient road capacity, stemming from the very bad decision Maryland has made through the years to not add additional Potomac River crossings north and south of the Greater D.C. region.
Let me remind readers that Maryland controls the Potomac River to the Virginia shore, so any transportation facility must be supported and built by Maryland, as was the case with the $2.5 billion Wilson Bridge replacement in the 2000s.
So, Hogan and his transportation people had no choice but to add lanes on I-495, the Beltway – which is now carrying 250,000 vehicles a day – and I-270, which is carrying almost as many vehicles.
In addition, the Maryland Department of Transportation forecasts the overstressed Legion Bridge on I-495 needs to be replaced due to wear and tear – as early as 2030, just five years from today.  This means lanes will need to be closed, thus making traffic congestion worse.  There are no other highway bridge alternatives.  Currently, delays in rush hour can be 30 minutes or longer, so imagine what will occur if the Legion Bridge goes from eight to six lanes?
So, not having any tax money for this $6 billion project, Republican Hogan decided to create a public-private partnership so a company could add capacity via high occupancy toll (HOT) lanes.  We have used HOT lanes in Virginia for more than a decade, and they enable motorists to pay market rate for using them and get a congestion-free ride in return.
The MDOT plan called for widening the 270 split and part of 495 near Bethesda and most important, rebuilding the Legion Bridge and adding a new span to bring capacity to 12 lanes.
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, agreed with Hogan to extend our beltway’s HOT lanes to the Legion Bridge and widen them to 12 lanes to match what Maryland would do with 495 and the Legion Bridge. But in Montgomery County, it garnered immediate opposition from the NIMBY culture and Democrat politicians, notably County Executive Marc Elrich, who never met a highway he ever liked.
MDOT went ahead with its solicitation and Fluor/Transurban won the job in 2021.  Virginia broke ground on its portion in 2022 and it’s due for completion in December.
But Elrich and Company colluded with political appointees in the Federal Highway Administration under Joe Biden to stop the 495/270 project by rejecting the Record of Decision in 2022.  Maryland Democrats in Congress worked to change that ruling with then-DOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
Transurban was prepared to break ground on the Legion widening and replacement in 2023 to meet up with Virginia’s widening when newly elected Gov. Wes Moore announced he wanted to rethink the project because tolls were not “equitable,” and seek a federal  grant to build it – some $6 billion.
As a result, Fluor/Transurban pulled out of the project in early 2023.
The Biden administration ended up rejecting Maryland’s request for a grant to widen and replace the Legion Bridge, and Maryland now has no money to do anything.
Meanwhile, Virginia’s Beltway widening to 12 lanes is moving along, but because the Legion Bridge has only eight lanes, it renders the project almost useless. And, Maryland will likely have to close lanes on 495 to make repairs around 2030. Moore, Elrich and other transit fanatics clearly screwed the D.C. area.
As for the I-495 Southside Express Lanes project Hodge mentions, he derides it as “outsourcing our state highway network to unaccountable privateers and their shareholders.” Another inaccuracy.
When the Wilson Bridge was replaced around 2006, only 10 of 12 lanes were opened to traffic. The other two were reserved for transit, high-occupancy vehicles (HOV) or general-purpose lanes. That’s what the Southside Express Lane project is studying. In my view, those two lanes should be opened to traffic immediately because the Wilson is horribly congested, too.
Transit boondoggles like Hodge mentioned will take years to complete and cost billions that neither Maryland nor U.S. DOT has to spend.
I hope Moore comes to his senses and reissues the public private partnership that Hogan worked so hard to achieve.

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)With more than 400 indigent defendants waiting for lawyers and a $13 million budget shortfall threatening to halt attorney payments, the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services is facing mounting challenges in providing constitutionally required representation.
The state courts have already warned that Maine’s failure to provide counsel to poor defendants amounts to a constitutional crisis, violating the Sixth Amendment. Yet the Maine Legislature underfunded the commission this year, leaving it on track to run out of money starting in April. That means the private attorneys who handle most of the commission’s criminal cases for a reduced rate expect to go unpaid for four months — and some may stop taking cases.
At a meeting Monday, Executive Director Jim Billings said the commission is preparing a supplemental budget request to cover the shortfall and address staffing needs. He noted that the waitlist for attorneys, which had shrunk earlier this year, has climbed back above 400 this month.
“I think there’s a variety of reasons for that, not the least of which is, again, telling people that are doing our work that we may run out of money,” he said.
With indigent defendants still jailed without lawyers, Maine stalls on broader justice reforms

“Another reason for that is we’ve had some well established attorneys … pull back on the number of cases they’re doing. Also attorneys in the public defender’s offices are at or near capacity, and so they’ve slowed down on the number of cases they’re able to take off the list.”
Maine’s public defense system is still relatively new, and the 33 state-employed public defenders cannot absorb most of the caseload. Instead, the commission relies on private attorneys under contract. Of about 300 lawyers on the roster, between 35 and 50 take on the bulk of cases, while others work part-time. Those lawyers billed about 325,000 hours last year and are on pace for 360,000 this year — exceeding the annual budget.
Because of those costs, the commission will have no funds left to pay rostered attorneys in the final quarter of the fiscal year unless lawmakers approve an additional $13 million.
During the public comment portion of Monday’s meeting, small law firms that take on indigent defense cases warned that the shortfall could force them to close their doors.
“We don’t have an option of not paying our employees,” said Robert Ruffner, director of the Portland-based Maine Indigent Defense Center, which contracts with the commission. 
“If any of these small firms are not able to get funding and have to go under, the effect  — especially since they concentrate or do exclusively this work — on the list is going to be not recoverable from.”
Christa Vo of the Maine Justice Collective echoed these concerns, noting that the uncertainty has already forced some attorneys to seek other types of legal work, which typically pays a lot more, disincentivizing some from returning to represent indigent defendants.
“When the announcement was made that we may end up with a period of time where we don’t get paid, I decided to start advertising family law,” she said. “But when you’re able to go back to something like family law, where you’re making twice the amount of money, a lot of people won’t come back.”
Both Ruffner and Vo highlighted the unique value small firms bring to the public defense system, providing an “on ramp” for new attorneys and maintaining a high percentage of court-appointed work out of dedication, not profit. But burnout and financial instability are pushing some to the brink. 
Attorney burnout high
The meeting also highlighted the results of the commission’s recent burnout survey, which more than 90 Maine attorneys responded to. The commission did a similar survey two years ago and, comparing the results, found that more attorneys were experiencing burnout now than in 2023.
Eighty percent of attorneys who responded said that they feel overwhelmed with work, and the same amount also said that they’ve experienced burnout in the last year, while 52% said that they agree or strongly agree that their feelings of burnout have affected their work.
Almost 60% of the attorneys have contemplated a career change.
Many survey respondents also mentioned that their burnout is being caused by too high of a caseload, and appreciated that Maine has caseload limits in place now. These caseload limits have been criticized by Gov. Janet Mills, who in her 2025 State of the Budget address suggested removing them as a solution to the indigent defense crisis.
“The problem isn’t that our group is not tough enough. It’s not that they’re not capable enough. It’s not that they don’t work hard enough,” said Caribou District Court Judge David Soucy, who serves on the commission. “The problem is the system is not operating in a sustainable way.”

Getty ImagesHave you ever wondered what college students are studying these days? Under a University System of Georgia policy rolling out this semester, finding out could soon be easier.
The policy, approved in May, calls for publicly posting all class syllabuses, including a course description, grading policy and reading list, onto university websites.
Starting this fall, syllabuses for mandatory general education and education classes are required to be posted. All courses will need to be viewable ahead of the fall 2026 semester, and all curricula vitae for faculty members involved in classroom instruction, including office address, work email and office phone numbers will need to be made public by the spring 2026 semester.
Some professors are expressing concern that the policy will open them up to harassment from people with ideological bones to pick but without expertise in their subject or connection to the university.
Speaking at a recent Board of Regents meeting, University System of Georgia Chancellor Sonny Perdue sought to tamp down on those concerns.
“I want to remind everyone of our intentions again,” he said. “At a time when many question the value of education, I think this is just one more way that we can show our commitment to transparency and accountability. The goal is straightforward. I just, frankly, was frustrated and confused about those people who objected to being transparent and accountable about what we want to teach.”
Perdue said some University System of Georgia institutions, including the University of Georgia, already have similar rules and the policy gives students clear and accurate information about courses so they can make informed decisions about what classes to take.
“If you’re teaching what you’ve committed in your syllabus, you don’t have a thing in the world to worry about,” he said. “Some are trying to stir up fear about this change. Let me be clear, there’s no cause for alarm to our faculty members who, virtually, by and large, are doing amazing jobs out there educating our students for student success. There shouldn’t be anything to hide.”
Some Georgia professors are expressing concerns after a case out of Texas A&M University in which a professor of a children’s literature course was fired after teaching materials related to gender identity. The university cited a Texas law requiring public colleges and universities to publish syllabuses and claimed the professor’s lessons did not comport with the class syllabus, a claim others dispute.
American Association of University Professors Georgia chapter president Matthew Boedy said Georgia professors fear similar retaliation or groups that could use technology to scrape vast numbers of course descriptions for readings or topics they find offensive.
“The idea that someone, whether it is a university system official or a disgruntled member of the public could say, ‘Well, their syllabus doesn’t match their catalog and they’re not teaching what you should be teaching’ is part of the fear of many professors, because we live in a world where online mobs are directed at people very quickly,” said Boedy, who is also a professor at the University of North Georgia. “I’m all for transparency and many of the professors are for transparency – to parties that have a stake in the classroom – which are, you know, students, and if you want to include parents in that.”
A survey of higher education faculty in Georgia released this month by the state chapter of the American Association of University Professors found 19.6% of respondents reported having curriculum choices questioned by administrators in the past year.
Another 23% of respondents said they are planning to apply for a job in another state in the coming year.
Of those, the most common reason listed for wanting to leave was their salary, reported by 62%. The next top reasons were Georgia’s “broad political climate,” listed by 56.5% and academic freedom, cited by 46%.
In an open response section, some professors described feeling overly scrutinized. Others worried they could be doxxed by “demagogues” or that they were being saddled with a pointless administrative burden.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) A new Trump administration rule bars immigrants living in the United States under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) from buying health insurance from Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
The change, announced in June, took effect at the beginning of this month. It reverses a policy change enacted by the Biden administration for last November’s annual enrollment period.
DACA, which President Barack Obama established in 2012, applies to certain immigrants who are here illegally but were brought to the U.S. as children. The program was enacted to protect them from deportation and allows them to work for renewable two-year periods. To be eligible, an immigrant must have come to the U.S. at age 15 or younger before June 15, 2007. DACA participants also must be high school graduates, high school students or veterans of the U.S. military.
The oldest are now in their early 40s, some with children of their own.
Even though there are some 525,000 active DACA recipients, only about 10,000 were getting their health insurance from the marketplaces before the policy change, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. However, critics of the new Trump administration rule say participation would have grown as more people became aware of their eligibility.
Under pressure, some immigrants are leaving American dreams behind

DACA recipients from 19 states were blocked from the marketplaces, though, because of pending litigation. More than 20% of all DACA recipients reside in just two of those states: Texas (17%) and Florida (4%).
Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules, said DACA was an “abuse of executive authority” and should not have entitled some immigrants to benefits. The rule change simply restores the status quo, Vaughan said.
“It was kind of an experiment or an end run around our legal immigration system that was set up by the rules that were set up by Congress to try to offer an amnesty to this particular group,” Vaughan said. “Because it’s not a legal status, these individuals are not, under the law, eligible for certain public benefits, and one of them is subsidized health insurance.”
But critics of the change say it’s cruel to cancel health care coverage for people who were brought to the country as children.
“Health care is a fundamental human right all of us, no matter where we were born, how much money we have, what we look like, what language we speak, we should be able to access quality and affordable care when we need it,” said Isobel Mohyeddin, a policy associate at the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrants.










The stripping of eligibility is a devastating step backwards, not only for DACA recipients, but families and immigrant communities in general.


– Isobel Mohyeddin, policy associate at National Immigration Law Center


Mohyeddin and her colleagues surveyed 433 DACA recipients in 2024, before DACA recipients were eligible for the marketplace. Eighty-one percent had health coverage, the vast majority through their employer or a union or professional association. But nearly 20% lacked coverage, more than twice the national uninsured rate of 8%.
Mohyeddin said that many of the DACA recipients without coverage reported skipping recommended medical and dental appointments or declining to fill prescriptions, because they couldn’t afford it or were fearful of being targeted for their status.
“The stripping of eligibility is a devastating step backwards, not only for DACA recipients, but families and immigrant communities in general,” Mohyeddin said.
While DACA recipients were only recently allowed to purchase coverage on the marketplace, it was a huge step toward better health outcomes for them, said Arline Cruz Escobar, director of health programs at Make the Road New York, a group that provides legal and social services to immigrants.
Most refugees and asylees will be denied food stamps under Trump’s new law

“We see a lot of mixed-status households, and so I think people are just very confused about what this means for them, and what it means for their families,” Cruz Escobar said. “We already know that the immigrant community doesn’t access enough preventive care and screenings and so, I can only imagine that we will see an increase in a lot of chronic conditions, or undiagnosed chronic conditions that could have been prevented.”
The impact of the new Trump administration rule on DACA recipients will vary, as some states offer other health care options to noncitizens.
States are going to have to decide whether they can afford to offer state-subsidized health coverage to DACA recipients and other immigrants who are no longer eligible for federal help, said Jessica Altman, executive director of California’s marketplace exchange, Covered California.
California has the most DACA recipients, at 147,440. Altman said more than 2,300 of them have purchased plans on the California marketplace and will lose their coverage. She said many DACA recipients in the state were not aware of their eligibility, and more would have enrolled if the Trump administration hadn’t made the policy change.
California provides state-funded health coverage to all income-eligible immigrants, regardless of their legal status. But Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a budget that scales back that coverage because of budgetary issues.
In light of federal changes and financial obligations on states, Altman said, California will have to make the same choices as other states about how or whether to help DACA recipients with their health care.
“The hard part is, to actually make coverage affordable for the populations that we’re talking about, you have to fund financial assistance at least somewhat comparable to what’s available on the federal marketplace,” Altman said. “So the state dollars are really where the rubber meets the road.”

(Getty Images)By the start of this school year, public schools across New Hampshire had banned students from using cellphones and electronics. But not all agree on what counts as a device.
Gilmanton, like many districts, has banned “cellphones, tablets, laptops, and smartwatches.”
Merrimack has also prohibited “laptops, portable video game consoles, satellite phones, and two-way radios.”
And in Lyme, the list of barred devices includes “camera phones, pagers, beepers, and other similar electronic communication devices.” 
The schools implemented the policies following the passage of a law this year that requires a “bell-to-bell” ban in all public schools. And while the law required schools to implement those policies, it has also afforded areas of flexibility. Districts have embraced them.
Passed as part of the budget trailer bill, House Bill 2, the bell-to-bell cell phone ban was a major priority for Gov. Kelly Ayotte, part of a bipartisan wave of state laws across the country driven by heightened concerns about screen use in schools, learning loss following the COVID-19 pandemic, and mental health problems among adolescents.
New Hampshire’s version of the law vacillated as it moved through the legislative process; an alternative version would have allowed students to use phones between classes. But last-minute political wrangling in the House around the budget allowed the stricter version favored by Ayotte to prevail.
“We know that test scores will go up; and so will academic performance because there’s more focus in the classroom,” Ayotte said on FOX News in August. “So this is really a win for our children.”
According to the enacted law — and a technical advisory from the state Department of Education on how to interpret the law — school districts must pass cellphone ban policies in which phones are turned off and put away from the beginning of the school day to the end. 
Those policies must include exceptions for students with IEP or individualized health care plans; “carefully tailored” medical needs approved by the school nurse; and students who are English language learners, the guidance states. 
Districts soon faced a constricting reality: School boards had a relatively short window to create their own cellphone bans. The cellphone ban requirement took effect July 1, and most districts started classes again by the end of August.
“Some school boards worked on their policies over the summer to get them in place for the start of school,” said Barrett Christina, executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association. ‘For other districts, that was a little bit more of a challenge, just because school boards don’t necessarily meet as regularly during the summer as they do during the school year.”
To address that challenge, the New Hampshire School Boards Association crafted and distributed a sample policy this summer to give school boards an easy template that complies with the state law. Many school boards have adopted it with few changes. 
But aside from the choice of language, there was another complication. The law required that school districts develop the policies “in collaboration with school parents and teachers.” That wasn’t feasible in all cases, Christina noted. 
In response, some school districts have passed placeholder policies with the intention of engaging with parents and fine tuning them later.
The result has been a patchwork of policies from school to school. 
The NHSBA sample policy names cellphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches among the devices that should be banned. Some districts, like Lyme and Merrimack, have inserted their own definitions.
There are no explicit policies outlining where students need to store their phones; some districts have specified lockers or special locking vessels like Yondr pouches, while others allow the devices to be stored in backpacks or handbags at the discretion of the student. 
And while most schools have instituted blanket bans with few exceptions, some districts have left wiggle room for students to bring in laptops and other devices — provided they are used for academic purposes. In Hopkinton, the policy states that “personal laptops may be used during the school day ONLY because district-provided laptops are not available for all students.” 
That came after long dialogue, said Hopkinton School Board Vice Chairperson Andrea Fulsom. While many school boards faced parents concerned with their inability to communicate with their children, the thorniest issue in Hopkinton related to the laptops. The district provides Chromebooks, but some high school students who take advanced classes such as engineering prefer to use their own, she said. 
“Laptops are not considered part of this if they’re used for educational purposes,” Fulsom said in an interview. “So that was helpful for us.”
While the NHSBA sample policy mentions laptops among the banned items, the guidance from the Department of Education, which came weeks later, specified that laptops are not required to be banned under the law. That gave Hopkinton a green light to exempt them, Fulsom said. 
Some policies include instructions to parents who might be unsettled by a newfound lack of direct access to their children. “This policy does not prohibit students from contacting 911, 988, or any other emergency hotlines in emergency situations,” states the Merrimack policy. 
School districts have diverged the widest when it comes to how to discipline students. The NHSBA’s model policy leaves this fairly open; it suggests a two-tiered discipline process. The first time a banned device is discovered, it could be confiscated and picked up by the student at the end of the day. The second time, the device could be confiscated and held until a parent or guardian picked it up, and the student could face a disciplinary referral. The model policy does not specify what that referral should look like. 
Some schools have taken that approach further. The Arts Academy of New Hampshire, a charter school, has a four-tiered process that contemplates consequences for students who refuse to relinquish their devices that can culminate in a one-day or three-day suspension. Some districts call for parents and school leaders to develop a specific plan for a student who continues to violate the rules. 
But other districts are more vague. In Dover, students who are caught a second time will be handled according to the school’s code of conduct. Goffstown’s policy does not lay out any specific consequences, leaving them entirely at the discretion of the superintendent. 
According to Fulsom, Hopkinton adopted the looser model of the NHSBA because the board wanted to acknowledge that consequences for elementary and middle school students should be different from high schoolers.
“We really felt that the people who were best equipped to come up with those consequences are the administrators, the principals of those schools, and so that’s why we left it,” she said. 
Despite the differences, Christina says the rollout of the policies appears to have been smooth.
“I’ve heard that implementation of the policy in the new law has not caused any great disruption for the school. Parents are aware of the new law. The kids are aware of the default.”
Fulsom agreed. After hearing from parents concerned about phone use, Hopkinton had already been interested in paring back personal electronics in the classroom, she said. But the new law made the school board’s job easier by making that change a requirement in state law, she said. 
As for students? They’ve adapted, Fulsom argued.
“While they were nervous about it prior to it going into effect, they found that it wasn’t so bad once it was in effect,” she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/phonesban-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 05:56:20.056356

(Photo by Susan Tebben/Ohio Capital Journal)Ohioans from across the state’s congressional districts joined hands in a circle around the Statehouse on Wednesday, as a show of solidarity and hope for a fair redistricting process.
More than 100 Ohio citizens joined the demonstration organized by advocacy groups including Common Cause Ohio and the League of Women Voters of Ohio, demanding that legislators listen to their concerns and follow the state constitution as lawmakers begin the process of redrawing the congressional districts in the state.
“I hope that they listen, and I hope that they incorporate everybody, not just the politicians, not just the Republican politicians,” said Cedarville resident Bob Ford.
Ohio has to create a new district map for U.S. Congress members to be used in the 2026 elections, because the map that was adopted in March 2022 did not have bipartisan support and was therefore was only usable for four years, as state law dictates.
The General Assembly has until the end of September to come up with a bipartisan-approved map. A joint legislative committee on congressional redistricting has been announced, with its first meeting set to happen on Sept. 22. A time and location has yet to be announced for that meeting.

In order for a map to be passed, the proposal would have to go through the normal bill process, with committee hearings on the bill before a full vote in both chambers. The legislative calendar shows an “if needed” session scheduled for the Ohio House on Sept. 23, but no Senate session. Both chambers have an “if needed” session scheduled for Sept. 30.
Ohio’s legislative Democrats introduced their own map proposal on Sept. 9, in what Democratic leaders said was an effort to get the process going and demonstrate urgency. The bill has not moved since it was filed.
A portal for citizens to submit their own map proposals is also up and running, with more than 60 proposals already on the legislature’s redistricting website.
Democrats proposed a congressional makeup of eight Republican-leaning districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts at the federal level. Currently, Ohio’s congressional delegation includes 10 Republicans and five Democrats. In 2024, Republican President Donald Trump got 52% of the state’s vote while Democrat Kamala Harris received 44%.
Anti-gerrymandering advocates, along with Democratic leaders like House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, have said Ohio’s map is “one of the most gerrymandered maps in the country.”
The Princeton Gerrymandering Project graded the current congressional map a “D,” particularly for it’s partisanship.
Despite that, Republican Ohio U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno has said he wants to see an even bigger Republican majority in the state, to take 12 of the 15 seats,.
At Tuesday’s rally, voting rights and anti-gerrymandering advocates said the process should work the way it was laid out explicitly after ballot measures in 2015 and 2018. The constitutional amendments that were voter-approved lay out the process, the calculations for districts and the rules for drawing them, along with requirements for public hearings.
“It is not rocket science,” said Diedra Reese, of social justice advocacy group the Ohio Organizing Collaborative. “The legislators have a road map for exactly how we can get to fair maps, so there’s no excuse for why we are even having a conversation about going backwards instead of forwards towards fair maps.”

The rally emphasized the impact redistricting and voting districts have on all kinds of Ohioans, but Ohio State University student Grace Metz wanted to make sure college students’ voices were included.
“The truth is that every Ohioan, students included, should care about who decides where and how their vote counts,” Metz said. “All of us deserve a fair Ohio, but this is just the start.”
With the implementation of Senate Bill 1 – the sweeping higher education reform bill passed in the General Assembly largely along party lines – scholarships that could be related to diversity are at risk, classroom discussions have rules and new regulations exist around faculty tenure and negotiations.
Metz said the legislative process for the bill suffered from a lack of transparency and a lack of input from people who would be directly affected, factors she wants to see change not only in the Statehouse, but in the congressional delegation.
“The reality of the situation is that we are scared, not only by the looming threat of censorship, but also by the reckless abandon with which our representatives treat our tax dollars,” Metz said.
If the legislature can’t come to an agreement by the end of September, the process moves to the majority-Republican Ohio Redistricting Commission, which then has until Oct. 31 to come up with a bipartisan map. If the commission can’t agree, the process goes back to the legislature, which will have until Nov. 30 to come up with a map, this time with only a simple majority necessary to pass it.

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said the city of Fayetteville is in compliance with the state’s “sanctuary policy” law Thursday, just one day after saying the municipality violated the statute. The decision allows the restoration of discretionary funding that was revoked as a result of violating the law. 
In Thursday’s opinion, Griffin acknowledged Mayor Molly Rawn issued a letter Wednesday clarifying remarks that he previously said violated the statute. Rawn’s office also “issued a statement reaffirming that City employees are not prohibited from cooperating with federal immigration authorities when legally required or requested,” according to Griffin who said these actions led him to conclude that the city was no longer in violation of the law. 
“Fayetteville Police Chief Mike Reynolds acknowledged receiving the statement and affirmed: ‘We have never, nor will we ever, refuse to assist our local state, or federal law enforcement partners,’” Griffin wrote. “Based on this evidence, it is my opinion that the City of Fayetteville is now in compliance with A.C.A. § 14-1-103.”
Griffin also verified that the city was again eligible to receive discretionary funding administered by the state, but noted his certification “is contingent on continued compliance.”
“If my Office is later notified that the City has adopted or implemented a policy, whether written or unwritten, that contravenes the statute, the City will again become ineligible for discretionary State funds,” Griffin said. 
Arkansas AG declares city in violation of state immigration law

The attorney general’s office notified city officials about the reinstatement, which ensures Fayetteville “remains eligible for these critical funding opportunities moving forward,” according to a news release from the city.
Fayetteville received nearly $1 million in state grants in 2024 that supported programs such as park improvements, fire services, drug crime enforcement, environmental initiatives and public safety equipment, according to the release.
“Our responsibility is to the people of Fayetteville. Keeping neighborhoods safe, maintaining and improving reliable services, and investing in our future are our priorities,” Rawn said in a statement. “I appreciate the Attorney General’s confirmation, which allows us to continue accessing state resources.”
The statute in question is the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act, which state lawmakers passed during the 2025 legislative session. Among other things, the law expanded the state’s current ban on “sanctuary cities,” a term for municipalities that don’t coordinate with federal immigration.
Griffin’s original opinion was requested by Rep. Kendon Underwood, a Cave Springs Republican who claimed in June that the city violated the state law after the mayor issued a news release clarifying the Fayetteville Police Department’s role in an Arkansas State Police traffic stop that involved federal immigration enforcement, according to the Fayetteville Flyer. 
The Fayetteville Police Department received a request from Arkansas State Police related to a traffic stop near I-49 and Exit 64 on the morning of June 17, according to a news release from the city. A Fayetteville police sergeant responded and observed both ASP and ICE personnel, but had no further involvement and left the scene. Fayetteville PD had not been contacted by ICE or other agencies regarding immigration enforcement operations in the city, according to the release. 
“I want to reaffirm clearly: The City of Fayetteville does not assist ICE in carrying out its agenda,” Rawn said in the release. “Our police department’s role is to keep our community safe, not to act as agents of immigration enforcement.”
Griffin wrote in Wednesday’s opinion that the mayor’s statement, which said it “reiterated the city’s position,” reflects a preexisting policy and that violated the state’s sanctuary policy law. 
Rawn issued a letter Wednesday to city council members and Fayetteville’s police chief clarifying that it’s the city’s policy “to fully comply” with all state laws, including the statute in question. 
“The City of Fayetteville has never had a written policy that affirms, suggests, or implies the existence of a sanctuary policy,” Rawn said. “However, to avoid any misunderstanding, I want to make it unequivocally clear that my comments should not be interpreted as supporting or establishing a sanctuary policy in violation of A.C.A. § 14-1-103, either now or at any point in the future.”
The letter contributed to Griffin reversing his decision, according to Thursday’s opinion.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-19 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT student loan borrowers face big changes under new federal policies,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/ct-student-loans-one-big-beautiful-bill/,"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act changed the way people can pay off student loans, and many in Connecticut are concerned about the effects.","Greg Jackson, a history teacher for New Haven Public Schools, remembers coming home from class at community college in Orange County, New York, in 1993 to find a $3,000 bill waiting for him.
He said he recalls asking his parents, “How are we going to pay for this?”
Their response: “We? You.” 
Jackson is one of 518,500 Connecticut residents who have a total of $19.1 billion in student loan debt, according to data analyzed by the Education Data Initiative. The average student loan debt in Connecticut is about $36,800, with about one quarter of borrowers owing between $20,000 and $40,000, Education Data Initiative reports.
Jackson owes $188,000. During the Biden administration, he was enrolled in the SAVE program, an income-based repayment plan that lowered the monthly payment amounts of many borrowers, and under which the federal government would take responsibility for interest payments that borrowers couldn’t pay. 
Jackson was paying just $36 a month. And as someone who worked in public service, he was eligible for loan forgiveness after 10 years of payments. 
But then the SAVE program became the subject of a court challenge from a group of Republican states that claimed that the program overreached in the amount of student loan forgiveness it allowed. Jackson, along with millions of other borrowers, had their loans placed into administrative forbearance in July 2024, meaning their payments were temporarily paused. Their loans began accruing interest again this past August.
Borrowers across the country, like Jackson, are facing significant changes in how they will have to pay for their college loans. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress in July will consolidate the current seven repayment plans into two: a standard plan, which requires a fixed monthly payment for between 10 and 25 years based on the size of the loan, and the Repayment Assistance Plan, which bases the monthly payment on the borrower’s income. 
Cristher Estrada-Perez, executive director of the Student Loan Fund of New Haven, said the changes would keep people in debt far longer than they needed to be. She said the loss of three of the four repayment plans that are based on income will leave borrowers with fewer options. 
Estrada-Perez said that under the SAVE Program, someone making between $50,000 and $60,000 annually would pay $62 a month in student loan payments. With the new Repayment Assistance Plan, that would rise to $167 a month. For someone on the same plan but making between $70,000 to $80,000 annually, payments would rise from $187 to $467 monthly.

Jackson’s new monthly payment, once he transfers into the new Repayment Assistance Plan, will be $240, nearly seven times what he’d been paying. That will limit his ability to save for retirement and to help his daughter pay for college, he said.
Jackson said he has been working with a consultant who told him he’d be eligible for loan forgiveness after 19 more payments — which, he said, is better than having to pay the full amount. 
Jackson was a first-generation college student and he didn’t know anything about student loans. He worked throughout his time at college, including three jobs during the summers. While getting his master’s degree at SUNY Albany, he worked overnight shifts in hospitality and as a substitute teacher at Albany High School. 
After earning a master’s degree in history, he worked for three years at a high school in the Bronx. He then went back to school on a full scholarship to Stony Brook University for his Ph.D. But even with the scholarship, Jackson had to take out loans to afford to live. Now he wonders if it was worth it. 
Jackson has been teaching in New Haven Public Schools since 2023, and he said while he loves teaching, he sometimes questions his decision to seek a doctorate decree. 
“It’s just like I have three letters out at the end of my name that cost me a ton of money,” he said. “And as a high school teacher, my students don’t understand what it means. And it really doesn’t mean anything.” 
Borrowing caps
In addition to changes to loan repayment programs, the federal budget bill capped the amount that parents and graduate students can borrow through certain federal loan programs. 
Under the new system, Parent PLUS loans will be capped at $20,000 annually and $65,000 total per child. Previously, there was no limit to the amount parents could borrow.
Michelle Jarvis-Lettman, Connecticut’s Student Loan Ombuds, said the new limits would be hard on low-income students. 
“ It was a great resource for those families to have … even though the interest rate was significantly high,” Jarvis-Lettman said. “Limiting the dollar amount that can be borrowed per year and then the lifetime limit per student — especially in a state like Connecticut, where the costs are significantly higher for higher education — is really going to change what students are going to be able to do and where they’re going to be able to attend.” 
Andrew Gillen, a research fellow at the Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom, said many people who were taking out Parent PLUS loans couldn’t afford to pay them back. He said there were other avenues that parents could take, like a home equity line of credit, that may have offered better interest rates. The interest rate for Parent PLUS loans in July 2025 was nearly 9%. 
“If we saw a private company doing this, we’d label it predatory lending,” he said. 
Under the new legislation, loans for graduate students will also be capped at $20,500 annually or a total of $100,000, with the exception of loans for specialty degree programs in medicine, law and dentistry, which will have a total cap of $200,000.
Estrada-Perez said this, too, would be particularly harmful for students who come from low-income backgrounds, as well as being shortsighted, given Connecticut has experienced a shortage of primary care doctors, particularly in rural areas, and of specialty doctors and nurses. 
“It is disastrous,” said Estrada-Perez. “On a moral level, it is basically saying, ‘If you do not have money, you should not go to higher ed.’” 
But Gillen and Preston Cooper, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said there was evidence that allowing greater student borrowing has driven up tuition rates at some schools. 
Gillen and Cooper referenced a 2023 working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, which found that the establishment of the Graduate PLUS loans in 2006 increased student loan debt but did not raise access to graduate programs for people from underrepresented backgrounds. The study also found that programs with more access to Graduate PLUS loans were more likely to increase their cost of attendance.
Gillen said that caps would eliminate graduate programs that ultimately didn’t justify the expense of taking out loans. Programs that were worthwhile, he said, would continue to see student investment. 
Cooper added that most students were borrowing below the caps that the new law sets. In his own analysis, Gillen found that half of the Graduate PLUS loan disbursements in 2023-24 went to 75 institutions. 
He said that students could avail themselves of more affordable public universities, where few students were borrowing above those caps.
But Jarvis-Lettman, Connecticut’s student loans ombuds, noted that tuition covers the cost of the faculty and staff required to run high-end institutions, along with funding the research these schools produce. She said she feared the loan limits would simply make it so that only wealthy students could afford to attend the higher-priced colleges and universities. 
Estrada-Perez argued that the loan limits wouldn’t limit the cost of public colleges and universities. Instead, she said, the caps would force colleges and universities to either close down or cut programs. 
Some research points to an ongoing decline in state funding for public universities as a contributor to the rise of student loan debt, as colleges have increased tuition rates to make up for the shortfalls. A 2022 report from the National Education Association found that 32 states were spending less on higher education in 2020 than they had in 2008. That report found that Connecticut’s investment in higher education decreased by about $1,500 per student during those years.
Data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System found that the University of Connecticut receives 37% of its funding from the state — one of the highest percentages across the nation. Yet both UConn and Connecticut State Colleges and Universities have claimed significant budget deficits in the last few years. According to a 2023 article in CT Insider, state funding for UConn dropped from 50% of the university’s budget in 1991 to 26% in 2023, although the actual amount in inflation-adjusted dollars remained relatively high. 
Chris Collibee, spokesperson for the state Office of Policy and Management, told the Connecticut Mirror that UConn and CSCU are responsible for controlling costs and limiting tuition growth. “We have worked closely with both institutions to encourage them to find efficiencies that reduce cost burdens on students and provide them with the skills Connecticut employers desire,” Collibee said. 
Samantha Norton, spokesperson for CSCU, said that state programs like the Mary Ann Handley Award, which provides debt-free community college to students in Connecticut, have helped with affordability, but she added that “sustained investment is essential to ensuring our institutions remain affordable and accessible for all.”
Concerns in Connecticut
University administrators in Connecticut are worried. According to a recent research presentation provided to the legislature’s Higher Education Committee by Nathan Fuerst, UConn’s Vice President for Student Life and Enrollment, and Mona Lucas, Assistant Vice President for Enrollment, parents of about 3,000 UConn students were borrowing through Parent PLUS loans in 2024-25, with an average loan of $20,417 — just over the $20,000 cap the federal government is implementing. 
But of those 3,000, about half had taken out loans that were more than $20,000. The average loan amount of those 1,500 borrowers was $35,000. 
Rhona Free, president of the University of Saint Joseph, said during a meeting of the legislature’s Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee earlier this month that her students come out of school with an average of $27,000 in debt. But she said they are hired for good jobs, and their loan default rate, 3.4%, is about a third of the national rate. 
“I would argue these are not students who are disillusioned with their higher ed experience, but, again, many of the students or their parents do need to borrow,” Free said. 
Free noted that the average Parent PLUS loan for students at SJU was about $22,000 — slightly above the $20,000 annual cap created by the federal government. 
Students at Connecticut colleges said during a roundtable in Hartford last week that they’d been raised believing that college was the best option for them to lead a successful life, but the cost of paying back college loans was overwhelming. 
Madison Sztaba, a UConn student getting her master’s degree in public administration, said she did everything she could to limit the amount of debt she had to take out. She took Early College Experience classes in high school for college credit, allowing her to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in three years. She lived at home with her parents in Torrington and worked 40 hours a week while taking 21 credits to graduate.
“What’s the balance of being fiscally responsible and being responsible for your health and mental well-being?” said Sztaba. “I shouldn’t have to feel so burnt out about trying to pay for school and at the same time working a job and eventually trying to gain all of this experience to enter the workforce.”
Sztaba said she took out $19,000 in loans, but at a 7% interest rate, which she said has continued to accumulate. 
For Nikolas DeAngelo, a senior at Trinity College, going to college was something his parents insisted on. A first-generation college student whose father works as an electrician, DeAngelo was expected to attend college to become an engineer. He ended up switching to an economics major. 
DeAngelo said most of his loans are private, at an 18% interest rate, along with some federal loans. He said he will graduate with over $100,000 in debt, despite receiving a large need-based financial aid package from the school. 
Trinity College Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Matthew Hyde said in a statement to CT Mirror that Trinity College has a “robust financial aid program” that “empowers it to meet the full demonstrated financial need for all of its students.” He said the program offers both need-based aid and merit scholarships. 
“As compared to many in the larger higher education marketplace, Trinity is less reliant on federal support for student aid in general. However, the recent changes add an unfortunate layer of difficulty for some students. Nearly 100 Trinity families participate in Parent PLUS program, and the average amount is nearly double the new cap,” Hyde said.
High demand for professionals
At an August meeting of the Board of Regents, Zulma Toro, the president of Central Connecticut State University, estimated that the loan caps could cost the university up to $10 million each year. She anticipated that the hardest-hit program would be the Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Practice, which currently has 87 students enrolled. 
“ It’s ironic, because there is a very high demand for those professionals, but we are sure, according to the analysis we have conducted, that a significant number of those students will not be able to afford the program,” Toro said at the meeting. 
The DNAP program takes three years to complete, and students cannot work during the program because of its intense clinical requirements, Toro said. 
Rachel Rachler, Chair of the Department of Nurse Anesthesia Practice at Central, said her students often come into the program with families and outside responsibilities. She said they take out Graduate PLUS loans — an average of $43,000 over three years — just to cover the cost of living. 
But that’s not all. According to Rachler, with the cost of tuition, fees and basic living expenses, the three-year program can run anywhere from $150,000 to $173,000. The new federal loan caps will limit lifetime borrowing to $100,000. 
Rachler said she doesn’t believe the loan limits will cause her program to lower its tuition. The program has expensive equipment and textbooks, and Central has to pay professionals in the field to work as faculty members. More likely, she said, the new loan limits will just affect enrollment. Like Toro, she noted that there is a shortage of anesthesia providers in the state. 
Stephanie Reitz, spokesperson for the University of Connecticut, said that 572 graduate students at UConn borrowed through the Grad PLUS program in 2024-25. More than 200 of those were studying either medicine or law. 
Asked if UConn officials were concerned that the new caps on federal loans could have a negative effect on the university’s doctoral program, Reitz said the university did not want to make “broad speculations.” She added that UConn’s programs “continue to generate strong enrollment and post-graduation outcomes” and that the school is the top producer of doctors, attorneys and dentists in the state.
The average amounts borrowed for each of UConn’s five graduate programs with the highest number of Graduate PLUS loan borrowers — law, medical, dental, social work and physical therapy — did not exceed the annual $20,000 limit that the federal government plans to impose, according to the data Reitz provided.

At the roundtable last week, Fabio Saccomanno, a second-year medical student at UConn’s School of Medicine, said he expects to graduate from medical school with more than $300,000 in debt. 
Saccomanno said he spent the summer working in Hartford with underserved populations. He said that while many of his classmates want to serve people in need, the amount of debt they have has driven them to look for more lucrative medical specialties, rather than going into primary care. 
State Comptroller Sean Scanlon said Connecticut needs to do more to attract and keep doctors in the state. He cited a program in Maine, which will waive student loan debt for medical professionals who practice in the state for five years. 
Josh Hurlock, deputy director for the Connecticut Higher Education Student Loan Authority, or CHESLA, said the agency was considering ways to bridge the gaps that the federal changes had created. He said his agency is looking at the creation of a replacement for the Grad PLUS loan, as well as the possibility of administering a loan program backed by state dollars that would make loan programs more accessible to students who might not qualify. 
The state also runs a program through the Office of Higher Education that allows Connecticut residents who have lived in the state for five years, graduated from a Connecticut university and completed 50 hours of volunteer service to receive up to $5,000 annually and $20,000 over four years in loan reimbursements. Tim Larson, Commissioner of the Office of Higher Education, said that the program has already paid $1.4 million to 558 students. Since applications reopened last month, they have received more than 1,000 applicants. 
Jackson, the teacher in New Haven, said he’ll continue to work at New Haven Public Schools — at least until his loans are forgiven. 
He said he doesn’t always recommend to his students that they go to college. He said he remembers watching students at Western — unsure of what they wanted to do, and unprepared for the academic and social requirements of college — end up dropping out saddled with student loans.  
“I just want them to … be able to provide for themselves and have health care. That’s really, to me, the most important thing,” said Jackson. “Statistically, when you have a college education, you do better. But I’m not certain that’s in the cards for everyone anymore. And my students specifically are the lowest economic status.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0910_SR_StudentLoanRoundtable_078-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-19 05:56:20.056356

Ohio State disenrolled Guy Christensen without a hearing and the lawsuit alleges the university violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights for engaging in “protected political speech,” according to the lawsuit.

Christensen is a 19-year-old pro-Palestinian social media influencer with more than 3 million TikTok followers. He finished his freshman year at Ohio State in April and the university disenrolled him in May after Ohio State received “myriad communications” from “members of the university community” expressing their “fear of violence and for their personal safety based on (Christensen’s) social media posts,” according to the lawsuit. 
His videos drew attention back in May when, in response to two Israeli embassy staff members being killed in Washington, D.C., Christensen urged his followers to “support” Elias Rodriguez, the accused killer, in a video that has since been taken down. Christensen originally condemned the killings, but took back his condemnation. 
Around that same time, Christensen condemned U.S. Congressman Ritchie Torres, D-NY, for his “support for Zionism and associations with pro-Israel political entities,” according to the lawsuit. Torres then urged the U.S. Capitol Police to investigate Christensen and the alleged threats he made. 
“Though undoubtedly offering passionate political views on contentious and fraught topics, Mr. Christensen’s videos contain no incitement to unlawful violence, nor do they contain any threats,” according to court documents filed by the ACLU of Ohio.  “The videos do not mention OSU and in no way target or even mention any member of the OSU community. In short, the videos constitute pure political speech on a matter of public concern, expressed off campus.” 
The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in the United States District Court for the Southern District. 
“We’re not going to comment on pending litigation,” university spokesperson Ben Johnson said in an email. “Ohio State is committed to protecting freedom of speech and expression.” 
The ACLU of Ohio is asking the court to say Christensen’s speech was protected by the First Amendment and disenrolling him violated his right to free speech. The lawsuit also wants the court to say Ohio State violated his due process rights by denying him a hearing and order the university to expunge any student records that said Christensen violated the Code of Student Conduct.  
“Ohio State University must permit students to think critically, speak boldly, and dissent without fear of expulsion, even if the viewpoints expressed are offensive to the Trump administration, or to the sensibilities of the majority,” ACLU of Ohio Legal Director Freda Levenson said in a statement. 
Ohio State does not have to agree with Christensen, but must respect his rights to political expression, ACLU of Ohio Managing Legal Director David Carey added. 
“The ACLU cannot allow the decision to summarily expel him for his views to go unchallenged, or the ripple effects will go well beyond this case,” he said.

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos for New Jersey Monitor/States Newsroom.)The Ohio Supreme Court is considering the case of an Allen County man named Patrick Heffley who says he should be able to purchase firearms again, despite several domestic violence convictions.
A lower court said no, he couldn’t, but Ohio’s Third District Court of Appeals disagreed. State prosecutors appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, insisting Heffley remains under weapons disability, and is thus barred from possessing firearms.
Federal statute generally prohibits a person with a misdemeanor or felony domestic violence conviction from having a gun. It provides, however, a handful of exceptions including the state restoration of the person’s civil rights. But under Ohio statute, restoration of civil rights hinges on an individual not being “otherwise prohibited by law” from having a firearm.
“Isn’t he caught between a rock and a hard place?” Justice Pat Fischer asked.
Assistant Allen County Prosecuting Attorney John Willamowksi readily acknowledged Heffley’s in a bind.
“It is effectively one statute saying (to) the state, you go first,” he said, “and the state statute saying federal disability, you be removed (first).”
Still, Willamowski argued state law is “plain and unambiguous.” Until Heffley’s federal weapons disability is gone, he can’t have his state civil rights restored. And until his state civil rights are restored, his federal weapons disability can’t be removed.
Background
Beginning in 2000, Heffley was convicted of a string of domestic violence offenses, including one fourth degree felony in 2006. Heffley served his sentence, paid his fines and court costs and made it through parole without incident. Since his release, Heffley told the trial court, his only contact with law enforcement was getting pulled over for a seatbelt violation.
Under federal law, a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction is enough to lose gun rights and so is a “crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.” Heffley was sentenced to 12 months for his felony, but the offense is punishable by up to 18 months behind bars.
In its arguments, the state leans on that felony conviction as the weapons disability keeping Heffley from getting a gun. In response, Heffley’s legal team points to a statement of legislative intent included as uncodified language in 2011’s House Bill 54.
The provision states, in no uncertain terms, that “The General Assembly is explicitly making this amendment to clarify that relief from a weapons disability (…) restores a person’s civil firearm rights to such an extent that the uniform federal ban on possessing any firearms at all (…) does not apply to that person.”
But the state dismissed that legislative language. The same section was subsequently amended — without the intent language — raising the question of whether the earlier, uncodified provision actually speaks to the current statute.
Oral arguments
More fundamentally, Heffley’s attorney Andrea Henning contends the state is misreading that “otherwise prohibited by law” provision in the underlying statute.
“Otherwise does not refer to the existence of the federal disability,” she told the justices. “It would refer to having a source other than what you’re seeking relief under.”
From Henning’s point of view, Heffley might be barred from relief if there was some other offense, but his state and federal weapons disability are fundamentally the same thing. Ohio’s courts can’t separate them for the purpose of legal analysis.
She said pitting the state and federal disabilities against one another, as the state suggests, would mean there’s Ohioans in Heffley’s shoes have little chance of ever restoring their gun rights.
“Despite,” Henning reminded them, “the legislature determining that they are worthy of an avenue to ask the court to consider granting this relief.”
Henning’s arguments resonated with some Republican members on the bench. Justices Pat Fischer and Pat DeWine pressed Willamowksi to explain away the uncodified section lawmakers approved in 2011.
“Do you think the result that you’re advocating today is what The General Assembly intended when they passed the statute?” DeWine asked. “I know the statute may say something different, but do you think that this is what they intended? That there is no way to get relief for this? That they’re in this Catch-22 circle?”
Even blunter, Fischer asked, “Why have an uncodified section? What was the point?”
Willamowski said it doesn’t really matter what lawmakers wanted — it matters what they wrote. If the General Assembly isn’t happy with the outcome, he said, they’ve got all the authority they need to change the law anytime they wish.
What’s more, Willamowski said, Heffley isn’t actually stuck in some Kafkaesque maze of contradictory laws. It might be a longshot, but he can seek a pardon or apply through the federal courts to rescind his weapons disability.
“You can apply to the United States Attorney General for relief from that federal firearms disability,” he said. “Whether individuals are regularly granted that or not, is something for the legislature to decide when they are crafting their statute here.”
And while Henning contends the state’s reading would set aside lawmakers’ stated intent, Willamowski argued the one Heffley and the appeals court favor, would create an even more “illogical” outcome.
Existing Ohio precedent holds state courts can’t remove a firearms disability that doesn’t stem from a state violation. Because federal law considers misdemeanor domestic violence grounds for weapons disability, while Ohio law does not, state courts can’t restore the gun rights of a person with a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction.
“If it is interpreted as the Third District (Appeals Court) is asking it to be, it would create an instance where it would almost incentivize individuals,” Willamowski said. “If you have a felony offense in that circumstance you could get your firearm rights back, where in the misdemeanor circumstance you couldn’t do so.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230211gunOrama03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 04:56:20.822023

The political assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman hit home for Ohio state Rep. Jack Daniels (R-New Franklin).
“I did put some cameras up around my house because, like I said, it was a little scary,” Daniels said.
It impacted the entire Statehouse, too. After that attack in June, an increased number of state troopers were guarding the building, and law enforcement surveilled politicians’ homes.
With the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk earlier this month, Daniels and Gov. Mike DeWine say more needs to be done to protect free speech.
“We have to kind of tone the rhetoric down a little bit,” DeWine said. “I think we have to respect our fellow Ohioans, our fellow Americans.”
Daniels and state Rep. Josh Williams (R-Sylvania) introduced a bill enhancing penalties for politically-motivated violence, with a homicide conviction resulting in a mandatory life sentence without parole and allowing for prosecutors to seek the death penalty in these cases.
“This bill is about protecting political speech,” Daniels said. “It’s about making people feel comfortable and increasing the penalty for that, hopefully, will deter political violence.”
But progressive activist Rachel Coyle with Ohioans Against Extremism said she worries that this legislation could be applied unequally.
“What is to stop the state from, for example, only giving the death penalty to left-wing cases or only to right-wing cases,” Coyle said. “It’s very easy to abuse.”
She added that the death penalty is increasingly unpopular with both Democrats and Republicans. DeWine, a critic of capital punishment, has not allowed any executions since he has was elected governor.
Coyle also raised concerns that this law requires any violent felony that prosecutors deem politically motivated to have a mandatory prison sentence of 10 years.
“You could add it to a crime that has nothing to do with political violence just to keep people in prison more if you don’t like them for personal reasons,” she said.
Daniels said that he doesn’t think that will happen.
“This is a bipartisan look at this subject… political violence is a danger to our society and it’s a danger to our democracy,” he said.
No Democrats have signed on, but he said he thinks they will.
“Our goal is just to give the judicial system all the flexibility it can to give the maximum penalty,” Daniels said.
While lawmakers grapple with political violence, several other ideas have been introduced.
A new bill would allow some elected officials to carry guns in government buildings.
H.B. 460 would allow lawmakers, statewide officials and judges to have firearms in any government facility. The politician must have a concealed handgun license, according to the legislation.
A bipartisan group of Ohio lawmakers introduced House Bill 306, which would make hate crimes illegal, increasing penalties for assaulting or terrorizing someone based on their race, sex or political affiliation.
These bills will be heard in the coming months.
Democrats continue to propose gun safety legislation, but those typically don’t get multiple hearings.
On Thursday, several lawmakers released a statement condemning political violence.
“In a free and democratic society, there is absolutely no place for politically motivated violence, nor should anyone encourage or celebrate this type of heinous criminal behavior,” read the statement from Senate President Rob McColley, House Speaker Matt Huffman, Senate Democratic Leader Nickie Antonio and House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn.
The statement went on to say the leaders on either side of the aisle “felt it was vital to join together to emphasize the significance of this message as we strongly condemn the assassinations of Charlie Kirk and Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman earlier this year.”
“A free democracy depends on the open and peaceful exchange of ideas. Political violence destroys the bedrock upon which that freedom of expression is built,” the statement continued. “When we are worried that our words or viewpoints might lead to political violence, we are no longer able to speak our minds or advocate for our priorities.”
The statement said “at the most basic level,” the legislators said “a believe in each other’s humanity” should be in practice, for the sake of the future of the country.
“Now more than ever, we must encourage respectful dialogue, starting here in the legislature, across both political parties, to bring about a brighter, more peaceful future here in Ohio,” the statement concluded.

(Eric Thomas illustration for Kansas Reflector)I wrote down this quotation in a notebook more than a decade ago: “Legal issues are the collision of right answers.”
Dan Weddle, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, said it during a legal conference, and it struck me as both sage and fair-minded.
The sentiment is so durable that you can substitute all kinds of phrases at the start of the sentence:
“Political questions are the collision of right answers.”
“Workplaces are the collision of right answers.”
“Disagreements between spouses are the collision of right answers.”
And this week, “The controversy about Lawrence police using private cameras is a collision of right answers.”
A city proposal in the university town aims to deliver hundreds of video feeds — from both public and private security cameras — to the Lawrence Police Department. Staff and officers could use the program to inform officers about the circumstance of calls they are responding to and also serve as evidence.
Language in the proposal would restrict police access to cameras at businesses and organizations: no live surveillance using cameras at private residences. The police department could not patch into your neighbor’s Ring doorbell in real time to watch Fido pooping in the front yard. Or, to watch you sipping a margarita on Friday afternoon.
Instead, Lawrence residents can notify police that they have a residential camera, allowing the department to contact them if there was an incident in their area. Police would then provide a way for residents to contribute video files of relevant situations using a weblink.
As documented by the Lawrence Times and Lawrence Journal-World, some community members are asking the city commission to tap the brakes before adopting this new security program.
After reading the news coverage, reviewing the municipal websites and looking through some of the public documents, I place debate about the security program in a complicated place: at “the collision of right answers.” Community members have legitimate arguments for pausing while the police present compelling reasons for moving forward.
On the public relations side, it’s never good when your public explanation of a policing program includes this quote: “The goal of both programs is not mass surveillance.”
Yikes.
If you (in this case, Sgt. Drew Fennelly of the Lawrence Police Department) are explaining to the famously liberal folks in a college town that you won’t be watching them all of the time from everywhere, you are definitely on the back foot.
He continued: “The department lacks the personnel to monitor even its own cameras continuously, let alone privately owned ones. Instead, the aim is to improve the speed and efficiency of investigations and to enhance officer safety by providing critical situational awareness as officers respond to a scene. … Both city-owned and private cameras are accessed only in response to a specific call for service.”
In other words, police won’t watch over your shoulders because we don’t have the manpower. More reassuring might be: “We know that snooping on you from your neighbor’s Ring doorbell is creepy, invasive and uncomfortable. That’s why we aren’t.”
Also, the partnership with technology vendor Axon feels shadowy, if not predatory.
First, using a private company to receive, store and analyze video footage from across town appears to begin a new public-private partnership. In this case, the private half is Axon, a corporation with a value near $60 billion that is best known under its former name, Taser. Yep, the company created the famous shocking police device.
Regardless of the character of the corporation, public-private partnerships like this one inevitably create gray areas. Who has responsibility for how the program runs? If Lawrence isn’t happy with how the program is running, can the city tinker with it? Or is Fusus, the software sold by Axon, a one-size-fits-all product?
With the company promising the use of artificial intelligence to analyze footage, it’s reasonable to worry about how that powerful technology would be deployed by a private company.
The website associated with the program, www.connectlawrence.org, immediately blurs that line. You might think the city of Lawrence runs the website, with the police badge at the top of the page, plus the department’s contact information in the footer. Not so fast.
The website is copyrighted to Axon Enterprise, and the pages’ source code points to the company’s web resources.
The biggest tell of who operates this public-private website? The homepage connects to “Shop Now” bundles that include cameras and yearly subscriptions to Axon technology. The bundles start with a $350 device that will connect four cameras to the Fusus system for a year. At the high end, there’s a $7,300 bundle pushing video feeds for up to 180 cameras to the police department for a year.
If the prices sound steep, you should see the climb in Axon’s stock price over the past five years. The company has flourished in selling gear and technology to police departments, with its stock price rising more than 800% in the past five years.
In fact, profits are so healthy that the company’s CEO has been listed as one of the best compensated in the United States. When the New York Times listed the top executives in 2024, using “traditional accounting,” Axon CEO Patrick W. Smith earned $164.5 million.
Using another accounting metric — compensation actually paid — Smith earned $385 million. That compensation number is 10 times larger than the 2025 annual budget for the entire Lawrence Police Department.
Watching a corporation and its CEO derive so much wealth from municipalities such as Lawrence, Overland Park and Wichita makes you wonder if taxpayers are overpaying.
Or, more precisely, they are being oversold — buying a suite of bundled products that the police department wants, rather than what they need.
Lawrence residents who have resisted the program also raise privacy concerns. Even with residential cameras restricted from surveillance use, Lawrence-based organizer Kincaid Dennett worries that cameras operated by businesses and organizations might record footage of nearby residences. After all, a camera’s vision is not restricted by property lines.
With all that said, there’s a compelling case to be made for the camera program. First, as described to the Lawrence Journal-World, video footage was recently instrumental in finding, prosecuting and convicting the shooter in a Lawrence murder.
Also, if cameras are positioned thoughtfully, they can only record situations in public areas. In doing so, they would have the same constitutional access to public areas that photojournalists like me rely on. If I can have my cameras and lenses on Main Street, then why not the police?
In San Jose, California, local retailers were optimistic last year about installing Fusus. Thefts jeopardized some businesses, owners said.
“That’s what I would call cheap insurance — in terms of ensuring that I can get a very detailed response to an incident that could be occurring at my business,” one shop owner said.
Finally, a registry of residential cameras feels much more restrained than the “1984” styled fears of Big Brother watching from every front porch every day. Having a system for finding residents who have footage steps back comfortably from the specter of cameras everywhere.
Because Axon technology is so widely used, Lawrence has company in wrestling with this balance, as many other towns have debated whether or not to implement the Fusus program: Clermont, Florida; Pell City, Alabama; Nashville, Tennessee; Charlotte, North Carolina.
Here in Kansas, the city of Lawrence must decide what to do when two right answers collide: pause or proceed?

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A three-year intra-party schism between Harford County’s executive and county council has given rise to an election challenge of first-term Republican County Executive Bob Cassilly.
Harford County Council President Patrick Vincenti, 71, launched his bid to unseat Cassilly at a Thursday night fundraiser in Churchville, where he drew a distinction between his style of leadership and what he characterized as Cassilly’s more polarizing and combative style.

“Let’s all be honest with ourselves about the current state of leadership in Harford County,” said Vincenti, who is completing his third term on the council and second as its president. “As far back as I can remember, Harford County’s government was competent, collaborative, and functional. Our leaders worked together. Republicans stood side by side to advance conservative principles. County executives truly partnered with public safety, business leaders, educators, and community organizations to solve problems. Sadly, we know this is no longer the case.”
In an interview, Vincenti said he made the decision to run because of the deteriorating relationship between Cassilly, the council and other officials.
“I’ve had three years with very little communication. It’s always one-sided,” Vincenti said. “The administration is trying to sidestep the council wherever he can. There’s no mutual respect. and I believe in respect. My mother taught me the importance of respect. And I always say communication is the key. We could find easier paths together if we just sat and talked and we didn’t argue. ”
Vincenti said the council and executive branch — he did not use Cassilly’s name — have not built a working relationship.
“I just think it’s a lack of willingness on the other person’s part, not wanting to sit and talk instead of dictating,” Vincenti said.
Harford County State’s Attorney Alison M. Healey (R), who introduced Vincenti Thursday, also drew differences between the council president and Cassilly without ever naming the county executive.

“He [Vincenti] strives for leadership that is transparent and worthy of the community’s trust,” Healey said. “He has repeatedly been a strong advocate for public safety. There is a huge difference between saying you support public safety and demonstrating through your actions that you support public safety.”
She praised Vincenti for his conservative values and fiscal stewardship — both likely to be issues in a majority-Republican county.
“Most of all, Pat repeatedly engages in something that we need more of from our elected leaders: collaboration and problem solving, ” Healey said. “Pat has forged relationships with all of our county agencies, our elected officials, small-business owners and other community leaders.”
Vincenti’s decision follows what has been a contentious term for Cassilly, a Republican-controlled council and a Republican sheriff and state’s attorney. Cassilly, 67, who announced his re-election bid in May, issued a statement within moments of Vincenti’s launch Thursday.
“As a fiscal conservative, I demand strict accountability to taxpayers,” Cassilly’s statement said. “Families, small businesses, and family farms can’t afford government bloat. I’ve held the line on County Government spending.
“By contrast, over the past three years my opponent expanded his County Council’s budget by 24% and repeatedly pushed to increase overall county spending every year. He seems incapable of saying no to spending more of your tax dollars,” Cassilly said.
The county executive also cited differences with Vincenti over land use, criticizing the council president for zoning changes that “promoted high density housing … and mega-warehouses.”
“The 2026 election offers a clear choice and, I expect, a spirited debate,” Cassilly said in his statement. “I’m confident voters want four more years of steady, accountable leadership that keeps Harford County strong.”

The announcement in Harford County caps three years of bitter feuding between Cassilly, the council, Healey and Harford County Sheriff Jeff Gahler, who attended Vincenti’s announcement but did not offer an immediate endorsement.
“For the past three years, we’ve had an administration that does not value public safety and law enforcement,” Gahler said. “We’ve had an administration that wants to fight with most all elected officials, regardless of party affiliation, and so many others in the county.
“I’m thankful that someone has stepped forward to change the wrong direction that this county is heading, and I look forward to hearing more about the council president’s plans during the course of the campaign,” Gahler said.
In just his first six months in office, Cassilly found himself at odds with the council and Gahler.
Cassilly started his term in 2022 by refusing to seat Jacob Bennett, a Democrat, who won a seat on the council. Cassilly claimed Bennett’s position as teacher in Harford County made him ineligible to be on the council. Ultimately, the Supreme Court of Maryland overturned a lower court ruling and ordered Bennett to be sworn in.

Cassilly touched off a dispute with Gahler after balking at funding for a proposed new facility for the sheriff’s department. Cassilly cited budgetary constraints.
After auditors for the council identified concerns about a budget transfer made by Cassilly without council approval, Cassilly ordered his staff to search the emails of council members.
The council accused Cassilly of a Nixonian effort to root out sources who were providing information to the council.
The email search because the subject of a grand jury investigation launched by the Office of the State Prosecutor in which there was no indictment.
Since then, Cassilly has pressed ethics charges against Councilman Aaron Penman, who is also a Harford County sheriff’s deputy. Cassilly successfully sought an order from a Circuit Court judge removing Penman from his council seat because of his job within the department.
That order is the subject of an appeal in the Appellate Court of Maryland.

(Photo by Stephanie Logue/U.S. Army)Just 20% of the state’s school buildings are in satisfactory shape or better, while the other 80% would need “repair, renovation or replacement” to get to that level, according to a report released Thursday.
The report from Comptroller Brooke Lierman said that the state needs to improve its school facilities if it wants to keep its reputation for top-ranked schools, but that doing so will require “a statewide reimagining of funding formulas and revenue streams.” The report did not make recommendations on that reimagining, however.
The report is part of the comptroller’s “State Spending Series” that assesses costs on various projects, impacts on the state and other economic factors. The first report, in March, focused on transit and the second, released in April, on climate change.
Thursday’s report was an assessment of school construction in the state.
“Spending on public school infrastructure is the second-largest public investment in our country,” Lierman said in a statement with the report. “This report should be a wake-up call; it highlights the urgent need to prioritize a state of good repair for Maryland schools, various ways that the state and local governments can control school capital costs, funding trends, and considerations for resource allocation.”

The report said that Maryland is one of only a handful of states that does a regular assessment of the condition of all its school facilities. It notes that 271, or about 20%, of the state’s public school facilities are in “like new, good, or satisfactory” condition. Of the remaining 80%, about 34% were characterized as “needs repairs” and 46% were rated as ““functions unreliable.”
The report states the Interagency Commission on School Construction estimated the nearly 1,000 schools would require repair, renovation or replacement just to receive satisfactory status. The commission is working on a project to assess the cost of additional school construction that would include prekindergarten classrooms and science labs.
Although Maryland ranked 17th in the nation on new construction cost per square foot, the state spent less on construction than some of East Coast and its neighboring states at $392 per square foot in 2020. In comparison, New Jersey spent $488 per square foot; Massachusetts at $480; Connecticut at $465; and Delaware at $420.
According to the report, the current cost for construction per square foot is about $600. In addition, construction costs have increased by 42% since 2019 and the cost of inflation has also risen.
Although the 30-page document doesn’t specifically address how to fund various school construction projects, but it does offer a few examples done in other states and Maryland jurisdictions.
In Massachusetts, about 1% of its 6.25% sales tax is dedicated to the Massachusetts School Building Authority, which reimburses school districts for construction projects with a cost-sharing formula based on wealth and population.
The report noted Iowa increased its sales tax from 5% to 6% by the state’s Secure an Advanced Vision for Education (SAVE) to dedicate increase revenue to school infrastructure projects and property tax relief.

In terms of Maryland jurisdictions, the report notes how Frederick County Council approved a dedicated revenue stream for school construction last year. It increased its property tax rate by five cents to $1.11 per $100 of assessed value to pay for school projects.
The report noted that while Baltimore City makes one of the greatest funding efforts in the state, the funding that results is constrained by the city’s limited property tax base:

One-third of properties in Baltimore are owned by governments or nonprofits, many of which provide immense value to the state via employment opportunities for Marylanders and the provision of vital services, but which are exempt from property taxes;
Low median home values ($219,300 in Baltimore compared to $397,700 in Maryland overall); and
Low median incomes ($60,000 in Baltimore compared to $100,000 in Maryland overall).

The challenge for funding school projects extends to small school districts as well, the report said.
Even with only five schools, Kent County has the oldest school buildings on average in the state. The report notes that county will have challenges in funding its shared of an estimated $68 million project to replace its middle school, which opened in 1950. In addition, the county has the state’s smallest population of more than 19,000 and an average annual capital budget of $2.7 million between fiscal year 2012 to 2020.
While school funding formulas have been largely unchanged, the report said, costs have been driven up by inflation and by expectations for larger schools that may serve multiple functions in the community, and by higher security demands. Some savings can be found, but that is only part of the solution.
“While increased capital improvements can be addressed through cost cutting measures, the ultimate solution will rely on a statewide reimagining of funding formulas and revenue streams,” according to the report.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/9022890-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-19 07:56:13.853743

Highsmith,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/beautiful-lies-vs-brutal-facts/,"As we face a future rife with emerging technologies—AI-generated content, deepfakes, synthetic voices—we must ask not just what is possible, but what is true.","In the late 19th century, the English biologist and philosopher Thomas Henry Huxley —a man known as “Darwin’s Bulldog” for his fierce defense of evolutionary science—offered a sobering observation about the nature of scientific progress. “The great tragedy of science,” he wrote, “is the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.” 
It was a lament not of pessimism, but of principle. For Huxley, the integrity of science lay not in clinging to elegant ideas, but in surrendering them when the evidence demanded it. In that painful act —the sacrifice of intellectual comfort at the altar of truth— he saw nobility. Today, Huxley’s wisdom feels not only relevant, but urgent. Yet the tragedy he described has been reversed. 

Carlton Highsmith
No longer are beautiful hypotheses being slain by ugly facts.
Instead, in our current age, beautiful lies are thriving —sustained and amplified by algorithms, tribal loyalties, and a global information infrastructure that too often rewards virality over veracity. Conspiracy theories, misinformation, and deliberate disinformation are not simply fringe phenomena; they are mainstream forces shaping public policy, health outcomes, elections, and even personal identity. 
What has changed is not the availability of facts, but our willingness to let them slay the illusions we prefer. Huxley believed deeply in the power of evidence and the responsibility of reason. In his time, this meant challenging creationist dogma with Darwin’s radical idea of natural selection. It meant enduring public criticism, engaging in intellectual battle, and risking reputation to uphold a principle: that truth must govern belief —not the other way around. He understood that humans are naturally drawn to explanations that flatter, simplify, or reassure. But he also knew that clinging to those explanations in defiance of evidence was a form of intellectual cowardice.
In our era, the beauty of a hypothesis is no longer measured by its elegance or coherence, but by its emotional resonance —its ability to reinforce identity, stoke outrage, or confirm suspicion. A conspiracy theory, however baseless, offers a kind of narrative comfort: It suggests that nothing is random, that someone is in control, and that believers are part of a special group with hidden knowledge. Against this, the truth often feels inadequate —too complex, too uncertain, too mundane. And so the fact, no matter how well-substantiated, is dismissed not because it fails to persuade, but because it fails to please.
This inversion of Huxley’s ethic —where loyalty to one’s preferred narrative overrides commitment to observable truth— has vast consequences. We saw it during the COVID- 19 pandemic, when misinformation about vaccines, masks, and treatments cost lives. We saw it during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, when a demonstrably false claim about election fraud incited an attack on the U.S. Capitol. We see it every day in social media ecosystems where fact-checks are dismissed as partisan spin, and where belief is a badge of belonging, not a conclusion reached through evidence.
To be clear, Huxley was not naïve. He knew that truth is often provisional —that scientific facts evolve, and that skepticism has a place in intellectual inquiry. But his was a skepticism rooted in rigor, not reflex. He demanded that claims be tested, not simply believed. He trusted that a mind trained in critical thought could change course when new evidence emerged. That idea—that one could be both skeptical and teachable—is profoundly lacking in today’s public discourse.
The age of misinformation thrives not only because lies are told, but because truth is devalued. What has eroded is not just the trust in institutions, but the very expectation that truth ought to matter. In many corners of public life, facts have become optional—pieces to be accepted or discarded depending on their utility to a preferred worldview. This is not healthy skepticism. I read the other day that many scholars think that we are living through a period of epistemic nihilism, which means that too many of us have stopped believing that facts matter. That anything is knowable. That there is such a thing as shared truth.
In the face of this crisis, we are called to reclaim Huxley’s ethic —to reassert the discipline of letting ugly facts dismantle beautiful lies. That means teaching media literacy in schools as seriously as we teach math. It means demanding transparency from technology platforms whose algorithms profit from outrage and distortion. It means defending journalists, scientists, and educators who labor under threat and derision simply for telling the truth. And it means practicing, in our own lives, the humility to change our minds when confronted by better evidence. 
The stakes are high. A society that abandons truth as its compass is a society adrift—susceptible to authoritarianism, paralyzed in the face of crisis, and unable to solve problems that require collective understanding. In such a world, the lie is not merely unchallenged—it is enthroned. And that, to borrow Huxley’s word, is the true tragedy.
Let us be clear: facts are not always comfortable. They may call us to revise our beliefs, admit our errors, or reconsider our loyalties. But that is the price of living in a reality- based world. T.H. Huxley knew that intellectual courage meant more than clever argument—it meant letting go of the beautiful idea when the facts made it untenable. In this age of digital distortion and cultivated confusion, that courage is more essential than ever.
If we are to reclaim the promise of science, democracy, and human progress, we must reaffirm the principle that Huxley articulated more than a century ago: that truth is not defined by preference, and belief must bow to evidence. Only then can we slay the seductive lie with the honest fact—and preserve, however painfully, the dignity of reason.
As we face a future rife with emerging technologies—AI-generated content, deepfakes, synthetic voices—we must ask not just what is possible, but what is true. We must reject the temptation to make peace with falsehoods because they flatter our politics or soothe our fears. And we must insist, again and again, that the true tragedy is not that facts can be ugly—but that lies, left unchallenged, can be deadly as they were on January 6th, 2021.
We are facing a civic emergency. T.H. Huxley gave us a framework for intellectual integrity. It is time we put it back at the center of our public life. The path forward may be uncomfortable, but it is the only one that leads to wisdom. In the slaying of our illusions lies the birth of our understanding. For without a shared understanding of reality, we become ungovernable. And if we lose truth, we risk losing the republic.

These actions threaten academic freedom, higher education, healthcare, and Connecticut’s economy. They are compounded by the $61.5 million cut to UConn Health in the most recent state budget.
Our elected officials must take swift action to protect the public good by allocating the resources needed to shore up Connecticut’s only public medical academic center.
Academic freedom under siege
The new executive order replaces expert peer review with political oversight, jeopardizing expert scrutiny and credible science while dismissing dozens of National Institutes of Health (NIH) reviewers, thus replacing the integrity and autonomy of scientific merit as they navigate an ever-changing political agenda. Critical fields like health equity, vaccine studies, reproductive health, gender studies, and LGBTQ issues are being defunded, undermining research that serves our communities.
Impact on UConn Health and our students
The repercussions are already being felt at UConn Health. In April 2025, NIH cancelled $1.7 million in unspent UConn research grants, including mental health and LGBTQ+ projects. A proposed slash of indirect cost reimbursement to a flat 15% threatens $35 million annually. Infrastructure, administrative support, equipment and labs employing nearly 750 research positions, including graduate students, postdocs, and clinician-scientists, face immediate risk.
Impact of Medicaid/Medicare/ACA cuts on UConn Health and our patients
Federal legislation will cut or eliminate some Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax subsidies and reduce the number of eligible Medicaid/Medicare enrollees by as much as 20%, resulting in devastating losses for the University of Connecticut Health Center and our patients. Patients will lose access to primary care and rely more on costly emergency services – a devastating result for patient health and UCHC’s infrastructure. The anticipated direct loss from changes to Medicaid/Medicare to UCHC alone is $25 – $40 million. Additionally, this level of disenrollment jeopardizes UCHC’s 340B program eligibility, the loss of which could be between $49–$69 million.
Ripples through Connecticut’s economy
The stakes extend well beyond our campus. In fiscal year 2024, NIH funding awarded $787 million to Connecticut institutions, impacting 6,831 jobs, and $1.78 billion in economic activity. These cuts endanger our research infrastructure and talent pool, pushing researchers to go elsewhere, hindering our ability to recruit top talent which can lead to a “brain drain.” The consequences include dampening state-generated innovation, threatening as many as 2,650 jobs in our state that depend on federal research funding tied to UConn and UCHC.
These federal measures erode and disregard academic freedom, disciplines that promote equity and diversity and community health.
In closing, we strongly and passionately urge our lawmakers to act now and convene a special session of the General Assembly to: 

Support the University of Connecticut Health Center, the state’s only public hospital, as we step up to meet the growing demands of patients as more and more become uninsured; and
Allocate funds to UConn and UCHC to offset state and federal cuts, especially for essential but stigmatized research and patient care to the most vulnerable.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Federal regulators will accept no public comments on a pending environmental study of oil leasing in Alaska’s Cook Inlet, a U.S. Department of the Interior agency announced through a Federal Register notice published Thursday.
There will be no public comment period and no public hearing on a draft supplemental environmental impact statement for a Cook Inlet lease sale that was held in 2022 but found to be legally flawed, said U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which manages oil and gas development in federal offshore areas.
The rejection of public comments is in accordance with Trump administration changes to the National Environmental Policy Act, the 55-year-old law that guides federal decisions about activities that may have environmental impacts. The changes are aimed at speeding up environmental reviews and developing infrastructure projects.
BOEM is following the administration’s updated NEPA regulations and a new department handbook on the law, which went into effect on July 3, said Elizabeth Pearce, a U.S. Department of the Interior senior public affairs specialist.
“This Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement is narrowly focused on addressing the court’s concerns, without a separate public-comment round – streamlining what is typically a protracted, multi-year process down to a few months.” Pearce said by email on Thursday.
Although no public comments will be accepted, the public will be able to read the new environmental impact statement when it is finished, Pearce added. “The completed Supplemental EIS will be posted online so Alaskans and other stakeholders can see exactly how we addressed the court’s limited concerns,” she said.
The Cook Inlet environmental study stems from a federal lease sale that was held on Dec. 30, 2022. It drew only one bid.
Earlier in the year, the Biden administration had planned to cancel the sale because of lack of industry interest. But at the urging of former Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the Inflation Reduction Act that narrowly passed Congress that year included a mandate for the sale to take place. Hilcorp Inc., the dominant oil and gas operator in Cook Inlet, submitted the only bid.
In response to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups days before the lease sale was held, U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason ruled in 2024 that the lease sale had been held without adequate study of impacts to endangered Cook Inlet beluga whales. Her ruling put the lease sale results on hold, and she ordered BOEM to conduct a new review addressing impacts to the belugas.
BOEM’s announcement about the lack of public comment opportunities was blasted by environmental plaintiffs in the case.
“BOEM’s decision to exclude the public from its supplemental environmental statement is unacceptable. Public participation is not a box to check — it is the heart of NEPA,” Loren Barrett, co-executive director the water conservation non-profit Cook Inletkeeper, said in an emailed statement.
BOEM’s earlier lapses concerning Cook Inlet belugas were “not minor oversights; they are serious errors that must be corrected with rigor and transparency and a proper review that allows the time for public input,” Barrett added.
Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director for the Center for Biological Diversity, also cited risks to the endangered beluga population, which is estimated to number a little over 300.
“This secrecy around exploiting public waters for fossil fuels is completely unacceptable. It would only take one oil spill to devastate Cook Inlet and its beluga whales, which is why the law requires transparency for these dangerous sales,” Monsell said in a statement. “The court found that federal officials failed to look at several important factors that could harm endangered belugas, including vessel noise. If the agency hides its analysis, we won’t know whether these critical issues have been addressed to better protect the belugas.” 
Hilcorp currently holds eight federal leases in Cook Inlet, including the sole lease acquired in the disputed 2022 sale. The company relinquished seven other federal leases in Cook Inlet. The BOEM website does not list any Hilcorp plans for exploring its remaining leases in the inlet.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-19 00:55:39+00:00,CT Mirror,"RFK, Jr.’s advisory panel recommends new restrictions on MMRV vaccines",Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/18/advisory-committee-immunization-practices-cdc-vaccines/,"Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices advised that MMRV vaccines not be given before age 4, postponed vote on hepatitis B shots for infants.","ATLANTA (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s hand-picked vaccine advisory committee on Thursday recommended the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopt new restrictions on a combination shot that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella.
The panel advised that the vaccine known as MMRV not be given before age 4 and that children in this age group instead get separate vaccines — one against MMR and another for varicella, or chickenpox. The vote was 8-3, with one member abstaining.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices put off an expected vote on hepatitis B shots given to infants on the day they are born. On Friday, it’s expected to decide whether to recommend that some babies can wait a month for those shots, and to also take up COVID-19 shots.
The committee makes recommendations to the CDC director on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs. Committee Chairman Martin Kulldorff said committee members aim to reassure the public and remove unnecessary risks and harms.
[RELATED: Amid vaccine uncertainty, CT joins regional health coalition]
But many doctors and public health experts say the committee is creating fear and mistrust around vaccines at a time when U.S. vaccination rates are already falling. Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, has made or proposed numerous changes to the nation’s vaccine system, including firing the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replacing it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.
Thursday’s meeting “promoted false claims and misguided information about vaccines as part of an unprecedented effort to limit access to routine childhood immunizations and sow fear and mistrust in vaccines,” Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement. “Instead of emerging with clear guidance about vaccines that we know protect against serious illnesses, families are left with confusion, chaos and false information.”
Experts are also concerned the panel’s actions could narrow access to the vaccines. The group voted 8-1, with three abstentions, to keep MMRV covered for kids as young as 12 months under the Vaccines for Children program, which pays for about half the shots given to kids in the U.S.
Several committee members expressed confusion during that follow-up vote on whether to align payments under the program with the more restrictive vaccine guidance they had just passed. Another federal official noted that there are other government insurance programs, including Medicaid, that will need to stop paying for that early combo dose because they have to follow CDC recommendations.
Panelists focus on rare seizures
Discussions on the MMRV vaccine focused largely on rare instances of feverish seizures associated with the first dose, given to kids between ages 1 and 2.
Committee member Dr. Cody Meissner said such seizures may be “a very frightening experience” for families, but medical experts agree they’re not linked to brain function or school problems.
The panel last dealt with the issue in 2009, when it said either the combination shot or separate MMR and chickenpox shots were acceptable for the first dose, but that separate doses were generally preferred. Today, 85% of kids receive separate doses for the first round, according to information presented at the meeting.
Some doctors and public health experts say they are not aware of any new safety data that would explain the revisiting of those vaccination recommendations — and, in fact, many of the studies discussed Thursday were more than a decade old.
Dr. Richard Haupt, a vice president at Merck, which makes the MMRV vaccine ProQuad, said it’s been evaluated through clinical trials and post-approval studies, and the slight increase in feverish seizures after the first dose led to current CDC recommendations. Combination vaccines improve completion and on-time vaccination at a time when the nation is seeing a troubling decline in vaccination coverage, he said.
Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases, said he doesn’t see the need for a new recommendation.
“It’s solution looking for a problem,” he said in an interview. “We have managed the MMRV vaccine situation for a number of years without any issues in terms of safety. It is a situation where it also allows a parent to have that discussion with their healthcare provider.”
The vaccine panel also discussed the hepatitis B shot
As many as 2.4 million people in U.S. are estimated to have hepatitis B, which can cause serious liver infections, and half are unaware of infection, a CDC presenter told the panel.
In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use. But it can also be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections. The virus can also live on surfaces for more then seven days at room temperature, and unvaccinated children living with anyone with a chronic infection are at risk.
[RELATED: Vaccine panel expected to recommend delaying hepatitis B shot for children]
A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms). The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.
Following the 2005 recommendation, hepatitis B cases among infants fell from 5,494 cases per year in 2005 to 2,214 cases in 2023.
During Thursday’s discussion, some committee members questioned whether babies born to moms who test positive for hepatitis B are the only ones who truly need a vaccine in the first day of life.
By giving virtually all babies the hepatitis B right after birth, “Are we asking our babies to solve an adult problem?” asked committee member Dr. Evelyn Griffin.
But Meissner expressed bewilderment at some of this discussion.
“This an absolutely safe vaccine,” he said. “I’m not sure what we’re gaining by avoiding that first dose within 12 to 24 hours after birth.”
Several outside medical experts asked why the committee was debating the issue at all.
“The signal that is prompting this is not one of safety,” committee member Dr. Robert Malone responded. “It’s one of trust. And it’s one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent.”
Osterholm said there will be consequences.
“As more doubt is sown in the safety of vaccines by this committee and political leaders in our health department, we’re going to see fewer people getting vaccinated and the return of the diseases we largely conquered,” he said. “It will make us less safe and less healthy as a nation.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25261599128177-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 20:57:03.542414

(Photo courtesy of PAcast)York County’s top prosecutor and law enforcement leaders detailed how a gunman ambushed police officers on Wednesday afternoon that left the three of them dead, and two others wounded. It was one of the deadliest incidents for Pennsylvania police officers in nearly two decades.
At a press conference Thursday, York County District Attorney Tim Barker named the slain officers as Detective Sergeant Cody Becker, Detective Mark Baker and Detective Isaiah Emenheiser. Another Northern York County Regional officer and a York County Sheriff’s deputy who were wounded were not identified. As of Wednesday night, they were being treated in WellSpan York Hospital.
“Each of these men represented the very best of policing,” Northern York County Regional Police Department Chief David Lash said of his fallen officers. “They served with professionalism, dedication and courage. They were leaders within our agency, committed to protecting this community and standing beside their fellow officers.”
The Associated Press reports the three slain officers were all longtime veterans of the force and had almost six decades of combined service.

According to Barker, the officers were shot by a man with an AR-15 style rifle outfitted with a suppressor. He opened fired as they were entering a home in North Codorus Township where a stalking incident had been reported the previous night.
“There is one motive though that is clear for everything, and that is the hateful scourge of domestic violence,” Barker said. Though he added that other aspects of the motive remain under investigation.
On Tuesday night, police were called to a home on Haar Road in the rural community. The ex-boyfriend of one of the residents was spotted on a trail cam at the property. He was dressed in camouflage, looking through a scope and had an AR-style rifle slung on his back.
The suspect, who was later killed in the shootout, has been identified as 24-year-old Matthew J. Ruth. Barker said more details will be provided after a full forensic investigation.
While Ruth’s ex-girlfriend said they dated for only a short period, she suspected that he had set her truck on fire several months back while it was parked in her driveway. She never sought charges.
On Tuesday night, after he was spotted, a warrant for Ruth’s arrest was issued and a search began. Charges included stalking, loitering, criminal trespass and prowling at nighttime.
Barker said there was no indication that Ruth had been previously charged with a crime that would have prevented him from legally owning a gun.










Thanks to the actions of the Northern York County Regional Police Department, supported by the York County Sheriff’s Department, we have two lives...that are saved today, and make no mistake about it.

The following day, officers searched the man’s residence and interviewed members of his family. The York County Sheriff’s Department also aided the search with a drone.
Shortly after 2 p.m, six officers, including Baker, Becker and Emheiser, returned to the home where Ruth had been spotted. They were accompanied by two other Northern York County Regional police officers and a York County Sheriff’s deputy.
They found the door unlocked and decided to enter. The family had left for their safety.
When the officers opened the door, Barker said, Ruth opened fire with a suppressed AR-15-style rifle. 
Baker, Becker, Emenheiser and another detective went down. The remaining detective and Sheriff’s deputy retreated and continued to fire at Ruth.
By the time the shooting was done, two minutes after it began, Baker, Becker and Emenheiser had been fatally shot. Another detective and Sheriff’s Deputy were also wounded. Ruth had been killed.
“Following the final exchange of fire, the actor became deceased,” Barker said.
Multiple law enforcement agencies and emergency personnel then arrived at the scene to provide aid and investigate.
“When I say numerous, I can’t tell you how proud I am of every single law enforcement officer in this whole county,” Barker said. “They all came from everywhere to be there, to help in any way they could.”

When the house was searched, officers found that the resident family’s dog, a black lab, had been shot and killed by Ruth.
Barker said more details will be provided, including possible motives and the result of forensic tests, when the investigation is further along. All actions by law enforcement, Barker said, were justified.
“Thanks to the actions of the Northern York County Regional Police Department, supported by the York County Sheriff’s Department, we have two lives of the residents there that are saved today, and make no mistake about it,” Barker said. “Had they arrived home and not Northern Regional police officers, they would have been killed immediately. That is not speculation. That is the absolute only reasonable inference from all actions.”
The Pennsylvania State Police is leading the investigation, along with the York County District Attorney’s Office.
State Police Commissioner Col. Christopher Paris praised the work of county police departments. 
“They are a credit to law enforcement, the diligence with which they carried out this investigation from its onset and the way that they doggedly and methodically did what they had to do in order to preserve life and seek justice,” he said. “It’s something that I know all people in York County and across the commonwealth should be very proud of.”
Federal law enforcement was also alerted. Barker said at an initial press conference Wednesday evening that the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s office in Philadelphia had been in touch.
At the same press conference, Gov. Josh Shapiro said he was contacted by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi herself said that the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were on the scene shortly after the shooting.
“After tragedies like this, we often look for reasons to explain unreasonable and unexplainable events, but oftentimes none come,” Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday said Thursday. “Yesterday, three families received a call that all law enforcement families fear each and every single day. They may not always talk about it or acknowledge it, but that fear is always there and very, very real.”
A member of the Northern York County Regional Police force listens to an update on September 18, 2025, on the shooting of multiple police officers in York County the previous day.
“I pray for the families that are dealing with unfathomable loss,” Sunday, a former York County District Attorney, added. “Our hearts remain with the two families that received the call about their loved ones being seriously injured.”
For now, the Northern York County Regional Police Department’s administrative offices are closed. Police coverage is being provided by neighboring departments and state police.
The department will resume service on Friday and said in a post on Facebook that, “we have been deeply moved by the outpouring of support from our community and across the Commonwealth.”
It added that those who wish to help can donate to a department-endorsed fundraiser for the families of the killed and injured officers.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/northern-york-county-regioal-police-hq-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 20:57:03.542414

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)A federal judge has directed the U.S. Department of the Interior and an irrigation corporation to stop diverting water from the Upper Clark Fork River near Deer Lodge to prevent harm to endangered bull trout.
U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order in a suit brought by two organizations, Save the Bull Trout and Alliance for the Wild Rockies, that alleges Interior and West Side Ditch Company are violating the Endangered Species Act in order to preserve the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site.
The National Park Service-operated historic site is a 1,618-acre working cattle ranch that was dedicated to commemorate the country’s frontier cattle era.
According to court filings, the federal government irrigates more than 400 acres of Grant-Kohrs to grow hay and maintain livestock pastures, holding seven water rights for irrigation and 16% of shares in the Westside Ditch Company, one of five irrigation systems used to convey water to the site.
The West Side Ditch diverts water from the Upper Clark Fork near Deer Lodge and conveys it more than 12 miles to Grant-Kohrs. The diversions can take up to 90% of water from the river during severe drought years, according to court filings.
But a huge swath of the Upper Clark Fork — 62.8 miles — is designated as critical habitat for bull trout by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services.
In 1998, bull trout were listed under the Endangered Species Act, and in 2010, Fish and Wildlife Services established critical habitat units for the species, including the Clark Fork near Grant-Kohrs.
In their lawsuit, the organizations allege Interior and West Side are diverting too much water from the river during parts of the year when streamflows are low, further reducing habitat for the endangered trout, which could “adversely affect” the species’ survival.
“In most years, the West Side Ditch takes 50% or more of the Upper Clark Fork flow in mid-to-late summer. In drought years, as in this summer, the diversion has been taking an even greater share of the river’s flow. There is simply not enough water left in the Upper Clark Fork River after this diversion,” said Michael Garrity, executive director for Alliance for the Wild Rockies, in a statement.  “The extent of dewatering has altered bull trout critical habitat so adversely that the species can no longer survive in that portion of the Upper Clark Fork, much less migrate to headwaters streams to spawn.”
The National Park Service and Department of the Interior did not respond to requests for comment.
The two plaintiffs filed a similar lawsuit in 2022. In that case, the Interior Department ultimately entered a settlement where the federal government would fund multi-year projects to upgrade the West Side Ditch so bull trout wouldn’t swim into the irrigation ditch and return flows wouldn’t degrade the river. The settlement included an agreement that if the federal government did not fund the projects to completion, the plaintiffs could return to court. Under the Trump administration, the Interior department “stopped funding the projects to replace the WSD diversion,” court documents state, giving rise to the current suit.
Stream flow along the Upper Clark Fork River near Deer Lodge.
As part of the previous lawsuit, Fish and Wildlife Services established a 90 cubic feet per second (cfs) minimum flow for the Upper Clark Fork near Deer Lodge where West Side diverts water in order to “maintain self-sustaining wild trout populations and the macroinvertebrates that support them.”
The federal agency also stated that if Grant-Kohrs Ranch does not irrigate when streamflows are below 90 cfs, leaving DOI’s share of water rights in the river, it would have a “significant impact” on maintaining the existing streamflows.
Over the last 30 days, streamflow data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey shows that the Upper Clark Fork has run well below 90 cfs, dropping to 34.3 cfs on September 9.
The lawsuit ultimately seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent the Interior and West Side form diverting water when streamflow falls below 90 cfs.
But West Side has argued in court filings that it would suffer from both a temporary halt and from an injunction, claiming agricultural and livestock losses.
In ruling on the temporary order, Morris wrote that the harms to endangered bull trout outweigh the ditch company’s argument, considering the irrigation season is “nearly complete.”
Morris has scheduled a hearing on the preliminary injunction for Sept. 25 in Helena’s federal courthouse.
“We have millions of cattle and thousands of hay fields in Montana, but there are very few bull trout left, especially in their historic spawning areas of the Upper Clark Fork River,” Garrity said. “Considering the Clark Fork River was a healthy river full of bull trout when the original Grant-Kohrs Ranch was founded in 1862, the question is whether the Park Service should destroy bull trout critical habitat for a historic ranch display when simply growing less hay can help return the Clark Fork to a living river where bull trout can once again survive, spawn, and avoid extinction.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IGrant-Kohrs_02-1024x552.jpg,,,2025-09-18 20:57:03.542414

As I walked out onto the frozen Arctic water off Utqiagvik, Alaska, for the first time, I was mesmerized by the icescape.
Piles of blue and white sea-ice rubble several feet high gave way to flat areas and then rubble again. The snow atop it, sometimes several feet deep, hides gaps among the blocks of sea ice, as I found out when one of my legs suddenly disappeared through the snow.
As a polar climate scientist, I have focused on Arctic sea ice for over a decade. But spending time on the ice with people who rely on it for their way of life provides a different perspective.
Local hunters run snow machines over the sea ice to reach the whales and seals they rely on for traditional food. They talked about how they know when the sea ice is safe to travel on, and how that’s changing as global temperatures rise. They described worsening coastal erosion as the protective ice disappears earlier and forms later. On land, they’re contending with thawing permafrost that causes roads and buildings to sink.
Their experiences echo the data I have been working with from satellites and climate models.
Most winters, sea ice covers the entire surface of the Arctic Ocean basin, even extending into the northern North Atlantic and North Pacific. Even in late summer, sea ice used to cover about half the Arctic Ocean. However, the late summer ice has declined by about 50% since routine satellite observations began in 1978.
The sea ice concentration at the end of the melt season for 1979, the first September with satellite data, and 2024. The pink line, for comparison, is the 1981-2010 median edge of area with at least 15% ice coverage. Both the ice-covered area and the concentration of sea ice in September have decreased, with ice cover down about 50% from 1979 to 2024. (Image by NSIDC)
This decline of summer sea ice area has a multitude of effects, from changing local ecosystems to allowing more shipping through the Arctic Ocean. It also enhances global warming, because the loss of the reflective white sea-ice surface leaves dark open water that absorbs the Sun’s radiation, adding more heat to the system.
 What coastal communities are losing

Along the Alaskan coast, the decline of the Arctic sea ice cover is most apparent in the longer ice-free season. Sea ice is forming later in the fall now than it used to and breaking up earlier in the spring.
For people who live there, this means shorter seasons when the ice is safe to travel over, and less time when sea ice is present to protect the coastline from ocean waves.
Open water increases the risk of coastal erosion, particularly when accompanied by thawing permafrost, stronger storms and rising sea level. All are driven by greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, particularly burning fossil fuels.
In some places along the Alaskan coast, erosion threatens roads, houses and entire communities. Research has shown that coastal erosion in Alaska has accelerated over recent decades.

More weeks of open water also affect animals. Polar bears spend the summer on land but require sea ice to hunt their preferred food, seals. The longer the sea ice stays away from land, the longer polar bears are deprived of this high-fat food, which can ultimately threaten the bears’ survival.
 The ice is also thinning and getting younger

Across the Arctic, satellite data has captured how sea ice has been thinning and getting younger.
As recently as the late 1970s, about 60% of the Arctic sea ice was at least 1 year old and generally thicker than younger ice. Today, the amount of ice more than a year old is down to about 35%.

Local residents experience that change in another way: Multiyear sea ice is much less salty than new sea ice. Hunters used to cut blocks of multiyear sea ice to get drinking water, but that older ice has become harder to find.
Sea ice forms from ocean water, which is salty. As the water freezes, the salt collects in between the ice crystals. Because the higher the salt content, the lower the freezing point of the water, these enclosures in the sea ice contain salty liquid water, called brine. This brine drains out of the sea ice over time through small channels in the ice. Thus, multiyear sea ice, which has survived at least one melt cycle, is less salty than first-year sea ice.
Since the coastal landfast sea ice around Utqiagvik no longer contains much multiyear sea ice, if any, the hunters now have to take a block of lake ice or simply gallon jugs of water with them if they plan to stay on the ice for several days.
 Why data shows a continuing decline

As long as greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, Arctic sea ice will generally continue to decline, studies show. One study calculated that, statistically, the average carbon dioxide emissions per person per year in the U.S. led to the disappearance of an area of summer sea ice the size of a large hotel room – 430 to 538 square feet (40 to 50 square meters) each year.
Today, when Arctic sea ice is at its minimum extent, at the end of summer, it covers only about half what it covered in 1979 at that time of the year. The Arctic still has around 1.8 million square miles (4.6 million square kilometers) of sea ice that survives the summer melt, approximately equal to the area of the entire European Union.

Climate models show the Arctic could be ice-free at the end of summer within decades, depending on how quickly humans rein in greenhouse gas emissions.
While a win for accessibility of shipping routes through the Arctic in summer, studies suggest that the large reduction of sea ice would bring profound ecological changes in the Arctic Ocean, as more light and heat enter the ocean surface.
The warmer the surface ocean water is, the longer it will take for the ocean to cool back down to the freezing point in the fall, delaying the formation of new sea ice.
 What now?

Arctic sea ice will continue to form in winter for the next several decades. The months of no sunlight mean it will continue to get very cold in winter, allowing sea ice to form.

Climate models have estimated that it would take extremely high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations to warm the climate enough for no sea ice to form in the winter in the Arctic Ocean – close to 2,000 parts per million, more than 4.5 times our current level.
However, winter sea ice will cover less area as the Earth warms. For people living along the Arctic Ocean coast in Alaska, winter ice will still return for now. If global greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced, though, climate models show that even winter sea ice along the Alaskan coast could disappear by the end of the 21st century.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderATLANTA — A key vaccine advisory panel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted to change its recommendations around certain childhood immunizations Thursday, despite the CDC’s own data showing that the vaccines are safe and effective.
The panel, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a wide range of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. The recommendations also play a key role in determining which vaccines are covered by insurance companies and how accessible immunizations are for the general public.
An overhauled CDC panel is set to issue guidance on COVID shot access and childhood vaccines

All 12 current members of the committee were recently appointed by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who abruptly dismissed the panel’s previous members and replaced them with hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics. 
During his opening remarks, ACIP Chair Martin Kulldorff — a doctor and former Harvard Medical School professor who is known for his opposition to vaccine mandates — announced that the panel will be establishing new working groups to study the impact of vaccines on pregnant women and review childhood vaccine schedules, suggesting that ACIP plans to revisit other widely accepted vaccine policies.
The committee’s actions this week are also being closely watched after former CDC Director Susan Monarez was abruptly fired last month after 29 days on the job. She testified Wednesday before a U.S. Senate committee that she was dismissed because she would not pre-approve ACIP’s vaccine recommendations or fire career officials for no reason. 
ACIP restricts use of MMRV vaccine
In the first of two votes on Thursday, the panel moved 8-3 to change its official recommendations around a combined immunization for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, which is more commonly known as chickenpox. The MMRV vaccine, which has been used since 2005 to reduce the number of injections that children receive and improve vaccine compliance, will now be recommended only for children ages 4 and older. 
Dr. Robert Malone, a biochemist who has previously said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise,” declined to vote, citing a conflict of interest with the vaccine manufacturer Merck.
The changes to the MMRV vaccine recommendations were made in response to data indicating that young children who receive the combined vaccine have a slightly increased risk of febrile seizures — or harmless convulsions in young children caused by a fever. However, according to CDC data, febrile seizures as a result of the MMRV vaccine were rare, occurring in about eight out of every 10,000 doses administered.
Only a small percentage of young children in the U.S. — about 15% — receive the combined MMRV vaccine as a first dose. The remaining 85% receive separate MMR and varicella vaccines for their initial dose. The majority of American children — or roughly 75% of them — receive a combined MMRV vaccine for their second dose, administered to those who are 4-6 years of age.
Certain ACIP members, including Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Dartmouth College who has served as a past committee member, criticized the focus on febrile seizures, which he said are generally not linked to vaccines and generally do not cause lasting harm to children who experience them.
“Every pediatrician is experienced in febrile seizures, and we know that the prognosis is excellent,” Meissner said, adding that the main concern doctors have around febrile seizures “is the anxiety it generates among the family members, and that’s entirely understandable, and it’s a very frightening experience. But I think people are very comfortable in saying that a febrile seizure is not associated with any sort of impaired performance or neurocognitive development.”
Doctors will now be required to administer the two vaccines separately for all children under 4 years of age, a move that experts say would not restrict vaccine access but may reduce uptake of one or both of the vaccines, particularly for children who have missed vaccine appointments in the past. 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Chair Martin Kulldorff speaks with reporters after the ACIP meeting on Sept. 18. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Kulldorf defended the decision to limit use of the MMRV vaccine, arguing that it would help restore trust in public health measures.
“I think trust and safety go hand in hand,” he told reporters after the vote. “The fewer adverse reactions we have, the more trust there will be in the vaccine schedule. So in my view, by giving MMR plus V instead of MMRV, there’s less adverse reactions, and that will lead to more trust.”
But in an unexpected twist, committee members voted 8-1 to allow the Vaccines for Children program — which provides free vaccines to children who are uninsured or underinsured — to continue using the old guidelines. That move imposes different requirements, though, for this federal program and others run through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
“HHS will examine all insurance coverage implications following today’s ACIP recommendation, prior to a final decision on adoption by the Acting Director,” the agency said in a press release following the meeting.
Three members abstained from the vote on updating the Vaccines for Children rules, citing concerns about having different requirements in place for different government programs.
“I don’t want discrepancy between the children who get their vaccine from VFC and the children who don’t get their vaccine through VFC,” Meissner, who abstained from voting, told the panel. “That’s not right.”
Upcoming votes scheduled on hepatitis B, COVID-19
The panel is set to meet again Friday, where committee members are scheduled to discuss updated recommendations for childhood hepatitis B vaccines and COVID-19 shots among adults. A set of votes on hepatitis B recommendations was initially schedule for Thursday, but postponed shortly before the end of the day.
The panel may choose to remove a recommendation that all newborn babies get vaccinated against hepatitis B, an incurable viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause lifelong impacts. The current three-dose series for infants includes one hepatitis B immunization administered within 24 hours of birth, and subsequent booster shots given a month and six months after the initial dose. ACIP has been recommending hepatitis B vaccine at birth for all babies since 1991.
If the revised recommendations take effect, official CDC guidelines will advise pediatricians to delay administering the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until 30 days after birth for all children whose mothers test negative for the disease. Parents will still have the option to vaccinate their children before one month of age, but a dose immediately after being born will no longer be the default option.
All eyes on CDC vaccine panel as Georgia officials mull access for the COVID-19 shot

The panel is also scheduled to address updating vaccine guidelines for healthy adults at Friday’s meeting. In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is tasked with overseeing vaccine development, approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines, but limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with certain health problems. Several states — including Georgia, where the CDC is based — are waiting for the committee to deliver its updated guidelines before deciding how widely available this year’s shot should be for the general public.
And in the absence of a federal consensus, states have begun to develop their own vaccine policies. California, Oregon, Hawaii and Washington state recently formed a group called the West Coast Health Alliance, which began issuing its own recommendations Wednesday. Florida, on the other hand, has announced plans to eliminate vaccine mandates altogether.
Noel Brewer, a professor of public health at the University of North Carolina and former member of ACIP who served for a year before being fired by Kennedy in June, says that medical organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics are increasingly withdrawing from ACIP and forming their own vaccine recommendations in response to shifting federal immunization policies. 
“Those are looked to by physicians, by doctors, as being the most authoritative word of the matter,” Brewer said. “ACIP is no longer that.”

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) has distributed co-sponsorship memos promoting a package of bills aimed at tamping down police violence and surveillance. Dubbed the “Freedom From Fear” package, the bills focus on facial recognition technology, police training and accountability. 
Residents in local Wisconsin communities have called for oversight of police surveillance, including facial recognition technology, and some have raised concerns about the surge in federal operations and deployment of military forces to cities around the country. Clancy’s  proposals would:
 

Require the decertification of law enforcement who violate “basic regulations on uses of force, among other standards set by the Law Enforcement Standards Board”.
Prohibit the use of facial recognition technology, which is known to incorporate artificial intelligence;
Ban the use of Automatic License Plate Readers, which a press release by Clancy’s office states are  vulnerable to hacking, despite being used to track and monitor thousands of vehicles nationwide,
Prohibit law enforcement from requesting, obtaining, or receiving access to an individual’s personal data in exchange for payment or a thing of value and without a warrant,
Set clear policies around releasing body camera footage depicting officer-involved deaths, with a focus on delays which could give police “the motive and opportunity to edit or delete footage,”
Prohibit police trainings that include content on “excited delirium,” which the press release describes as “a nonscientific, nonmedical term often used to justify police violence and other abuses of authority,” 
And prohibit “warrior-style training” methods among law enforcement which could lead to “unnecessary injury and death, in favor of aikido training focused on self-defense, de-escalation, and the disarming of threats”.  

In Milwaukee, civil liberties advocates and community activists have drawn more attention to concerns around surveillance by the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), with a particular focus on license plate readers and facial recognition technology. 
Critics of the two kinds of tech have expressed concerns over the technology’s use without a warrant and their ability to gather information on numerous people who are not the target of any particular investigation. Recently, Wisconsin Examiner also found that several Wisconsin law enforcement agencies utilizing Flock license plate readers entered vague reasons for using the network of cameras.

Facial recognition technology presents its own unique challenges. Questions have been raised about the technology’s ability to accurately detect and identify faces, particularly people of color. Earlier this summer, MPD announced that it was considering acquiring facial recognition technology from the company Biometrica, in exchange for providing the company with 2.5 million images and records related to people who’d passed through Milwaukee’s criminal justice system, including those who had not been convicted of a crime. In June, as the sheriff’s office began to explore a similar deal, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors joined calls to regulate facial recognition technology. 
“In this critical moment, as military forces take over cities across the United States one by one, at President Trump’s whim, we cannot continue investing more public resources and power in unaccountable law enforcement,” Clancy said in a statement. “As state legislators, we have the elected duty and authority to check government overreach in Wisconsin — that overreach is at its most dangerous when done in secret, while armed, and in cooperation with an increasingly openly fascist President.”
Clancy blasted MPD and other nearby law enforcement agencies in his statement for “giddily trading the data of hundreds of thousands of people for access to technology that will let them exploit, and inevitably misuse, the same data.” He called the technology “untested and unregulated” and questioned Biometrica’s ability to secure the data which it collects.

Meanwhile, President Trump has elevated Immigration and Customs Enforcement as the administration’s premiere federal law enforcement agency, with an enhanced budget that surpasses the military spending of most of the nations  in the world. Trump advisor Stephen Miller also recently  threatened to “identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy” left-wing movements and organizations, using language reminiscent of the COINTEL PRO intelligence programs run by the FBI for decades under J. Edgar Hoover. During the George Floyd protests of 2020, there were numerous reports of police surveillance and intelligence gathering operations.
“This bill package will prevent this ongoing abuse of sensitive data, without oversight, that MPD and other law enforcement agencies have simply given themselves permission to collect and misuse,” Clancy said in his statement. “We won’t  heal the damage done, or move forward, without securing the kind of basic protections we’re proposing today. These bills are a start, but an important one.”

“Many point to immigration policies impacting construction sites, tariffs causing a rise in construction costs and overall economic uncertainty, which makes companies feel less confident in making investments,” the Design Build Institute of America said on its website in reaction to the August national numbers. 
Education and Health Services gained 1,300 jobs in Nevada. 
The state’s unemployment rate decreased slightly, from 5.4% in July to 5.3% in August, the result of individuals leaving the labor market. 
Only California and the District of Columbia had higher unemployment rates than Nevada as of July, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Nationally, the unemployment rate rose from 4.2% to 4.3% in August. 
“The August report shows a job market that is largely stationary,” Chief Economist David Schmidt said in a news release, adding private sector employment fell by more than 6,000 jobs in August, but the state has not experienced a surge in unemployment claims. 
The total number of nonfarm jobs in Nevada was 1,570,100, unchanged from a year ago.
The Las Vegas area lost the equivalent of 4,300 jobs in August, compared with July. Reno saw a decrease of 400 jobs, while the Carson City market added 300 jobs.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/construction-Housing-_RondaChurchill_001-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 19:58:35.330951

The Bolivar County coroner had earlier drawn the same conclusion and determined no sign of foul play.
The body of Demartravion “Trey” Reed was discovered shortly after 7:30 a.m. in a tree beside pickleball courts and dorms on the Cleveland campus.

In the hours and days after, many students and staff have felt besieged as what seemed like every few minutes their cellphones buzzed with new rumors and speculation. The campus was rattled.
What students and faculty saw and heard did not resemble a Cleveland they know.
It was a hot late summer day when Reed’s family joined Delta State University President Dan Ennis and local law enforcement for a press conference Wednesday. Across campus, students still pulled up to empty parking spots closest to their classes, loitered outside the student union and brought food to friends in the library or to their dorms.
Eight students and three faculty members interviewed by Mississippi Today shared a mix of fear, hope, grief and numbness.
One longtime Delta State employee and father said what took place was hard to put out of mind. He saw the body hanging when he approached the pickleball courts Monday morning, with police patrol car lights flashing nearby.
He said it remains the worst thing he’s seen during 14 years of working on campus. 
“I just hope it gets better before it gets worse,” said “D,” who works as a groundskeeper and gets to work around 4 a.m. He wished to go by a nickname for fear of retaliation at work.
“You’ve got to take care of yourself,” he said. “That’s all you can do.”
A Delta native, he said Cleveland and Delta State are generally safer than nearby cities. He looked out on the main drive where a Cleveland police car followed a Delta State police car in a ring around the main quad. They maintained a moving perimeter.
He said he doesn’t trust local law enforcement and is skeptical of their statements that there was no evidence of foul play. The state medical examiner on Thursday confirmed the cause of death hanging and the manner of it was suicide.
It’s been a hard three weeks for the young father, whose son died three weeks ago from gun violence in a nearby city.
“I hate it,” he said of Reed’s death. “He was almost 21 years old. You can’t act like it didn’t happen.”
A different kind of Delta
Delta State University student Leticia Stevenson.
Leticia Stevenson of Clarksdale is studying at Delta State to become a teacher. She said she was “a little freaked out” when she heard what happened.
“I was thinking to myself: Where is the public safety at?”
Her family 45 minutes away wanted her to withdraw from school, but she said she is determined to get her education and work in her dream field.
Her older relatives brought up the history of lynching. 
She’s been leaning on her faith and has been keeping the Reed family in her thoughts. Despite the fear that she felt at first, she said she is looking forward to finishing her fall semester.
Cleveland is a lot more peaceful than where she grew up in Clarksdale, she said. The campus has been welcoming and locals are friendly, she’s found.
“It’s a small town,” she said.
For another student from Madison, the hanging similarly provoked fear. The student, who said she wanted to remain anonymous because she’s looking to get hired for a job on campus, found out about the death from an email blast when she was leaving a morning class.
She said she was nervous about attending school in the Delta given “its reputation” of crime. But has found Delta State to be a laid back, secure and warm environment. She has never felt it was dangerous because campus and city police are always patrolling.
One eight-year Delta State employee was in the cafeteria when he found out about Reed’s death.  He saw a number of students and faculty clustered near each other following the developing story. He found himself conversing with several students that day.
“There’s just a lot of unknown. There’s still a lot we’re going to know,” said the employee, who did not want to give his name because of fear of retaliation in his administrative role. “I’m waiting for the process to work its way out.”
He said he feels comfortable on campus. He said Delta State and Cleveland are the kind of places where people know each other and tend to trust each other regardless of race and status. If your car is in a ditch, several cars will stop to ask if you need help, he said.
“It’s not a big campus,” he said.
Delta State’s enrollment in fall 2024 was 2,654, making it one of the smallest public universities along with Mississippi Valley State University and Mississippi University for Women. More than most other public universities in the state, Delta State draws primarily from nearby counties and cities.
Cleveland, with a population of roughly 10,000, has branded itself “A Different Kind of Delta” in tourism brochures as part of an effort to showcase the city’s charm. Unlike most other cities in the Mississippi Delta, Cleveland boasts a significant middle class and an engaged junior chamber of commerce. Its downtown rarely has an empty storefront, which is not the case in nearby cities and towns in the long-impoverished region.
‘Always looking around at my surroundings’

DSU student Paris Ricks said the news coverage has been hard to watch. Reed’s death was a tragedy that she struggled to understand.
“It’s sad,” Ricks said. “I’m still concerned, but I do feel safe.”
She first heard about Reed’s death while scrolling through social media. It later came up in conversation with family and friends on campus. Relatives wanted her to visit home and check in regularly.
Delta State is a mostly “chill” campus, she said. Ricks likes seeing familiar faces across campus. Her rural, Delta high school was also small but lacking the excitement of Cleveland and Delta State. Here, she can go to a bowling alley, a Tex-Mex restaurant, a downtown arts center and several boutiques and restaurants. There’s plenty of live music, too.
Despite feeling protected in Cleveland, Ricks takes extra precautions.
“Walk home in groups, especially if it’s at night,” she said. “I’m always looking around at my surroundings.”
One student who was carrying flyers for a student election said he has had trouble sleeping. He didn’t want to share his name because of the election.
While he didn’t know Reed personally, the student had come across him at events on campus. 
“As a young Black male, I’ve never encountered any racial hate incidents or racism,” he said.
He acknowledged the unfortunate significance of the hanging taking place in what he referred to as a PWI, or predominantly white institution. 
At Delta State, nearly 49% of students were white, 42% were Black and 9% were classified as another race in 2024. Among non HBCUs in the state, it boasts the highest Black student population.


According to “JJ,” a current Delta State student who studies humanities and social science, a bigger conversation should be had about mental health.
“I just thought it was sad that he took his own life but I still want to wait till we get all that information,” said JJ, who didn’t want to give his last name because he will join the job market when he graduates in a couple of months.
A north Mississippi native, he said Delta State wasn’t a far college move. This week, his parents have called up each day to express their concerns. Like other parents of Delta State students, they have been expecting a visit as well as regular calls.
“It’s a chill campus and not much happens so when something like this happens, it’s kind of crazy in a way,” he said.
JJ said he doesn’t think what happened should discourage high schoolers from applying to and attending the university.
“You hear a lot of stuff about what they thought happened, and it’s not true,” he said.
A viral TikTok on Monday by a former Delta State University student who falsely claimed to be a relative of the deceased dominated timelines across the country and world. The young man spoke to a culture of racial killings and incidents on campus and in the city, which is neither backed up by crime statistics, local news reports or the experience of nearly all students interviewed on campus.
The video, which has since been taken down, alleged without evidence that Reed was the victim of a modern day lynching. Scrolling through social media applications, videos from across the country echo the same theory.

Mississippi Public Safety Commissioner Sean Tindell told Mississippi Today that the rush to judgment in this case was “a gross misrepresentation of where we are in Mississippi.” 
It’s unfortunate that people and politicians began calling this a “lynching” before there was any investigation or determination regarding what happened, he said. “It’s frustrating.”
“Suicide is such a tragic situation. I don’t know anybody that hasn’t been impacted by it,” he said. “We  need to do more to raise awareness and for those who need help to get help.”
JJ said he believes that it was a suicide and has been keeping the family in his thoughts. He hopes more students take advantage of the mental health resources and counselors on campus. They really helped out a good friend of his, who was struggling with the transition to college.
Delta State offers free consultations for professional counseling for students, faculty and staff. Counselors are available to help those struggling with anxiety, depression, grief, anger, trauma, adjustment to college life and addiction, among other mental health challenges. Free sessions were recently made available to students with the announcement of Reed’s death.
The campus is still tightknit and “relaxed,” JJ said. He’s glad he chose to attend Delta State when he was a high school senior rather than a bigger school where people feel more disconnected from classmates.
“It’s still home,” he said.

“We were freaking out,” said Stone Child College President Cory Sangrey-Billy.
Montana has seven tribal colleges out of the 35 in the country — the most of any state.
The schools together are estimated to receive $108 million, or roughly double last year’s allocation, said Sangrey-Billy.
“It’s quite a significant jump,” she said.
Now, budget planning is underway at Stone Child in Box Elder and other tribal colleges in Montana.
And tribal education leaders in Montana are touting the results of an economic impact study that shows the federal investment pays dividends to taxpayers.
The report, from the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, said tribal colleges in Montana added $332.2 million in income to the economy in the 2022-2023 fiscal year.
“There is a value to what we bring to the table,” Sangrey-Billy said. “And that’s where we’ve been very successful.”
Based in Alexandria, Virginia, the American Indian Higher Education Consortium has a mission to amplify the voices of tribal-led colleges and universities.
A message on its website said it applauds the Trump administration’s increased investment in Tribal Colleges and Universities.
“This one-time allocation by the federal government for Fiscal Year 2025 is progress towards fulfilling federal trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations as intended and a welcome new precedent in increased investment into TCUs,” the consortium said.
The consortium also said some of the increase comes from dollars that were cut from other federal programs supporting Native American and Alaska Native students at non-tribal colleges.
It encouraged a federal commitment to support all Native students “wherever they pursue post-secondary learning.”

Montana Tribal Colleges and Universities consist of Aaniiih Nakata College on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation; Blackfeet Community College; Chief Dull Knife College on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation; Fort Peck Community College; Little Big Horn College on the Crow Indian Reservation; Stone Child College on the Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation; and Salish Kootenai College on the Flathead Indian Reservation. 

Stone Child does not have the funds in hand yet and is also waiting to see the constraints on spending, Sangrey-Billy said.
She said the money could be allocated for infrastructure, for example — and Stone Child is in need of a new roof. It also could be designated for assessment and education, she said — such as to support student retention by paying for tutors and mentors.
Either way, she said, college leaders are thrilled with the additional money — and pleased to report the return on investment to the community.
The economic impact report, “Building Local Economies of Scale,” measures both the economic impact of tribal colleges in Montana and their returns on investment to students, taxpayers and society.
One of the impacts that resonated with Sangrey-Billy included payroll of $47.1 million — “much of which was spent in the state on groceries, mortgage and rent payments, dining out, and other household expenses,” the report said.
Sangrey-Billy said shopping options are limited near the college on the Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation with 213 enrolled.
“We can only get a few groceries out there so we have to go to Havre (or Great Falls). The economic impact that we have there is big,” she said.
The report also said TCUs generate more in national tax revenue than they receive. It said for every $1 of public money invested in Montana’s tribal colleges, national taxpayers receive $1.40 over the course of a student’s life, and state taxpayers receive $12.40.
It estimated the social benefits to society at $500.8 million through a mix of added student income of $337.1 million, added business income of $135.6 million, and avoided costs of $28.11 million.
Brad Hall, president of Blackfeet Community College in Browning, said tribal colleges are “a good investment,” but changes in the White House can mean changes in objectives.
He said that means tribal college leaders need to educate new administrations about their value. He just returned from Washington, D.C., where he met with federal leaders in education and found them receptive.
“Now that we’re getting to the table and talking more, there’s a willingness to hear what we absolutely need,” Hall said. “A lot of the people we’re working with have never really worked with tribal colleges or were aware of that.”
One issue that’s caused confusion, he said, is that tribal colleges are not DEI programs — the Trump administration has moved to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
Hall said the colleges are tribally chartered campuses in which the federal government has a fiduciary and trust responsibility to help maintain.
“The advocacy just takes time, but I can tell you with certainty we do have our baseline funding, and it’s just that this year was harder to budget for because we didn’t have the certainty that we normally have in budget cycles,” Hall said.
He too pointed to the results of the economic impact study from the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, conducted in partnership with Lightcast. The report said Lightcast provides colleges and universities with labor market data to help create better outcomes for students, businesses and communities.
In Montana, tribal college alumni generated $258.6 million in added income for the state in the 2022-2023 fiscal year, or the equivalent of 4,017 jobs, for instance, the report said.
“We’re not institutions that just take,” Hall said. “We’re institutions that are absolutely vital and contributing to the communities that we serve.”

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner) LINCOLN – A lawsuit appears headed for dismissal against a key associate of Lincoln businessman Aaron Marshbanks, whom officials blame for perhaps the largest case of bank fraud in state history.
The associate, Brandon Dallmann, handled cryptocurrency investments and the associated passwords for Marshbanks, who died of a drug overdose in November 2022 as a massive bank fraud case against him was becoming known.
A month later, it was revealed that Marshbanks, a former star athlete at Lincoln Christian High School who bought and renovated residential properties, had obtained around $45 million in loans fraudulently from 19 financial institutions in Nebraska, Iowa and other states.

As part of the effort to recover assets from the Marshbanks estate to pay off debts incurred by banks and credit unions, the lawyer handling the estate sued Dallmann, seeking information about the extent of Marshbanks’ crypto investments and the “keys” needed to discern whether assets remained.
On Thursday, a hearing to discuss the status of the lawsuit was held before Lancaster County District Court Judge Lori Maret. The judge granted a continuance in the case until Dec. 3, but the Examiner learned that the lawsuit will likely be dismissed because of Dallmann’s cooperation in helping track down the crypto investments.
According to the lawsuit, shortly before Marshbanks overdosed, the businessman emailed Dallmann with instructions to keep his crypto investments “rolling” to benefit his wife in the event of his death. He also provided the crypto keys to access them, the lawsuit said, and an “investments summary.”
It also alleged that Dallmann had withheld information, which his attorney, Nicole Jilek, said was untrue and contributed to the pending dismissal of the lawsuit.
Marshbanks used the proceeds from the ill-gotten bank loans, officials have said, to launch a “highly aggressive options trading strategy” in 2022 through his financial advisor, Jesse Hill. Some of the money was used to make payments on the earliest bank loans and to begin construction on a multi-million home and barndominium east of Lincoln.
Marshbanks’ investment adviser, Jesse T. Hill, pleads guilty to bank fraud conspiracy

The investments tanked in 2022, however, losing 90% of their value, officials have indicated, and the scheme began to unravel.
The scandal sent shockwaves through the state’s banking community over how a supposedly legitimate businessman, who had served on the Lincoln Christian School Board and was known for charity work, could fool so many financial institutions into loaning him money. Assets still being recovered from the Marshbanks estate are expected to repay only cents on the dollar to cover debts, according to lawyers involved in the case.
Hill falsely attested to bankers that Marshbanks had plenty of funds in investment accounts as collateral for the loans, which totaled $2 million each or more, according to federal court records.
Hill is scheduled to be sentenced in U.S. District Court on Oct. 30. He faces up to 30 years in prison and up to a $1 million fine. He has agreed to forfeit his share of ownership of a condominium in Puerto Rico and an airplane, both of which were purchased by Marshbanks.

Larry Rhoden, points toward the property line of land in rural Lincoln County that had been surveyed for the purpose of constructing a men's prison. (John Hult/South Dakoa Searchlight. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota taxpayers lost $21 million when their leaders abandoned plans for a men’s prison in southern Lincoln County.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s office released the figure to lawmakers on Wednesday and to the public on Thursday. It came as part of what he described as a funding plan for a prison in Sioux Falls, the merits of which will be debated during a special session of the Legislature on Tuesday in Pierre.
Lawmakers in February rejected Rhoden’s plea — which he inherited from his predecessor, Kristi Noem — for support of a 1,500-bed, $825 million prison on the controversial Lincoln County site. That land’s neighbors, who unsuccessfully sued the state over zoning on the property, helped sour the deal by persuading local lawmakers to oppose it.
Inmates, ex-guard and others charged in alleged drug and contraband conspiracy at penitentiary

By the time the Legislature rejected the Lincoln County plan, the state had already spent or obligated more than $50 million in preparatory funding.
The sunk costs came up during meetings of the Project Prison Reset task force, a group convened in the wake of February’s prison vote failure. Its members ultimately voted to back a 1,500-bed men’s prison in northeastern Sioux Falls and cap its price at $650 million.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, the task force’s leader, said some of the Lincoln County money could be clawed back by repurposing Lincoln County prison designs for a new location.
Tuesday’s funding plan spelled out how much for the first time.
The state spent a total of $52.7 million on the Lincoln County endeavor, the plan says. According to the Rhoden administration, $31.9 million of those costs should not be considered lost, because they funded local water wastewater improvements, were spent on prison designs that are being repurposed, and were recovered in the swap of the Lincoln County land for the Sioux Falls land.
Of the total amount spent, $10 million was federal funding, given to Lennox to pay for the wastewater upgrades needed to service a prison. The Rhoden administration does not consider that wasted money, reasoning that the federal funding would’ve gone to a local infrastructure project one way or another.
The remaining $42.7 million came from state coffers. About $17.4 million of the design work paid for out of that pool of funds has since been folded into a layout for the prison on Benson Road in Sioux Falls. 
Also counted in that $42.7 million was an $8 million transfer from one state office to another: the Department of Corrections to the Office of School and Public Lands. The transfer gave Corrections the title to the 320 Lincoln County acres upon which it had hoped to build its prison. The state took ownership of the land years ago, when the owners died without heirs or a will, and had been leasing it for farming. 
As industrial land, an official assessment determined in 2023, those farm acres would be worth $8 million.
Some lawmakers skeptical as governor pledges rehab task force ‘following the passage’ of prison bill

According to a purchase agreement signed for the Benson Road property last month, however, those Lincoln County acres are worth $4.5 million if they keep growing crops.
Thursday’s funding plan says the state “recovered” $4.5 million in “land value” through its purchase agreement, which would swap the Lincoln County land and $12.5 million in cash for 148 acres along Benson Road, located in an industrial area between Sioux Falls and Brandon. That land is valued at $17 million, the state said when it announced the land swap deal.
The land deal would only go through with legislative approval.
Earlier this week, Rhoden’s office released a document outlining how it was able to revamp its prison plans and reduce square footage to hit the $650 million construction target set by the prison task force. 
After factoring in the $21 million lost in Lincoln County, Rhoden’s funding plan says, the state can still deliver a 1,500-bed prison complex for $154.2 million less than it asked for — and didn’t get — for the same number of beds back in February. Rhoden expects to be able to fund the project with money from the budget legislators adopted last winter and from a prison construction savings account filled by lawmakers during the last several years.
Tuesday’s special session is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. before a speech by Rhoden to a joint session of the state Senate and House of Representatives at 9:30 a.m.

(Photo by zamrznutitonovi/Getty Images)The state of Utah is suing Live Nation and Ticketmaster over the cost of the tickets they sell, alleging hidden fees and disingenuous resale enforcement are driving up costs for consumers.
The lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claims Live Nation and its subsidiary, Ticketmaster, make up the largest ticketing company in the country, serving as the primary ticketer for 80% of major concert venues. Plus, according to the lawsuit, its share of the secondary ticketing market is growing.
Now, according to the complaint, Live Nation is raking in billions from mandatory fees on all its sales — but not until customers reach the end of the transaction, when after being shown a deceptively low price, the cost of their ticket spikes.
Or, even though the event appears to still have seats left, customers find it’s actually sold out and are shuffled to a secondary market where they are forced to pay even more, despite Live Nation and Ticketmaster claiming they limit the number of tickets a buyer can claim in order to prevent scalping, the lawsuit claims.

According to the lawsuit, Live Nation and Ticketmaster profit first when the secondary seller purchases the ticket, and then the companies get additional revenue when the ticket is resold. 
From 2019 to 2024, Ticketmaster generated over $11 billion in revenue from mandatory fees and an additional $986 million in resale fees, the plaintiffs claim. 
Florida, Illinois, Virginia, Nebraska, Tennessee and Colorado have also joined Utah in the lawsuit, which alleges Live Nation and Ticketmaster have violated the Better Online Ticket Sales Act and the Utah Consumer Sales Practices Act, as well as laws in other plaintiff states.
In a news release, the Utah Department of Commerce’s Division of Consumer Protection and the Utah Attorney General’s Office said Live Nation and Ticketmaster fees make up 24% to 44% of consumers’ total ticket price.
“Live Nation and Ticketmaster have systematically eroded consumer trust by deliberately misrepresenting ticket costs. By hiding mandatory fees and misleading customers about ticket limits and security measures, they have not only violated consumer protection laws but also undermined the integrity of the ticket purchasing experience,” said Margaret Woolley Busse, executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, in the release.



Let us know what you think...


 


As an example, the complaint includes screenshots of the customer experience purchasing tickets to see popular Puerto Rican rapper, singer and songwriter Bad Bunny at the United Center in Chicago in March 2024. A customer purchasing two tickets at $245 apiece — $490 combined — would ultimately be charged $662.21, or 23% more than the listed price.
“Smaller and lighter text next to the total price indicates that this final cost includes $60.96 in tax. But the page has not displayed the remaining $111.04 in mandatory fees (a $45.20 service fee on each ticket, a $6.00 facility charge on each ticket, and an order processing fee of $8.85),” the lawsuit states.
When it comes to Live Nation and Ticketmaster’s measures to prevent buyers from purchasing more than the limited number of tickets that artists have set, the lawsuit claims the companies have knowingly allowed resellers to bypass those restrictions since at least 2018.
“Today Utah is stepping up, cracking down on these deceptive tactics, to make sure everyone can get seats to their favorite shows without being victimized,” Utah Attorney General Derek Brown said in the release.

In response to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and talk of annexing Canada, provincial liquor authorities stripped American booze from store shelves. Canadian tourism to the United States plummeted. And British Columbia’s premier, David Eby, threatened to place tolls on commercial trucks traveling from the U.S. through B.C. to Alaska along the Alaska Highway. Doing so would further increase the state’s already high cost of living and possibly disrupt its food supply chain.
The Alaska Highway, or AlCan, was built in 1942 to keep the state supplied and defended in the event of a Japanese attack. Mile Zero is located in the very small city of Dawson Creek on the eastern edge of British Columbia, near the Alberta border. To reach it, Alaska-bound trucks can enter Canada at any of several border crossings in northern Washington, Idaho and Montana; I-5 hits the border at Blaine, Washington, while I-15 arrives at Sweetgrass, Montana. Various highways funnel traffic toward Dawson Creek, the options thinning as drivers head north, until there’s just the one road and the AlCan begins. From there, it climbs north and west to Beaver Creek, Yukon, Canada’s westernmost community, and then crosses the international border, plunging deep into Alaska’s sparsely populated interior before officially dead-ending in the town of Delta Junction — 1,387 miles from Dawson Creek — where it joins the older Richardson Highway to Fairbanks.
I’ve lived alongside the Alaska Highway, where it passes through the Yukon capital of Whitehorse, for most of the past 16 years. The tolls have yet to be implemented — although Eby’s government has created the legislative framework to do so — but I was fascinated by the threat, and by the paradox of a road built for Alaska’s defense transformed into a glaring weakness by unpredictable foreign relations. I pictured Alaska as a balloon bobbing at the end of a very long string, with Canada, an unexpected adversary, wielding a pair of scissors.
Getting fresh food to Alaska has been a challenge since the first settlers began scratching in the creek beds for gold. It was just too far from the continent’s more populated areas, separated from the contiguous United States by cold, stormy seas and, on the few precarious overland routes, avalanche-prone mountain passes. During the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890s, authorities feared that the hordes of prospectors would starve, and stories from that time — almost legends at this point — depict entrepreneurial types struggling to bring unbroken eggs all the way to the Yukon gold fields or herd reluctant cattle over Alaska’s Coast Range. Thirteen decades later, the challenges remain. Alaska’s food prices are second only to Hawai’i’s. One recent federal study found that prices in Anchorage were 36% higher on average than those in the Lower 48. A 2023 report commissioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) described Alaska’s food supply chain as “unique and vulnerable to disruption.”
I wasn’t the only one surprised by Eby’s apparent willingness to threaten that supply chain — to hit Alaskans in the gut. “It’s going to be a big deal,” Alaska state Sen. Robert Myers, R, who also works as a commercial trucker, told the Alaska Beacon. “Fresh produce — the vast majority of our fresh produce … gets trucked up. If you want to get something up here fast, you put it on a truck, not a barge.”
The truth is, Canada doesn’t have nearly as much power over Alaska’s food supply as Myers or I assumed. The supply chain was never just a long thin string. It’s actually more of a tangled ball of yarn, and the Alaska Highway, it turns out, is just one thread.

THERE’S NO DOUBT THAT TRUCKING is the fastest long-haul option. No railroad connects Alaska and the Lower 48, and air freight is financially viable for only a few high-end commodities — non-Alaskan seafood, say, and time-sensitive produce like cherries. It takes around 40 hours of nonstop driving to cover the more than 2,200 highway miles from Seattle to Fairbanks via the AlCan. Even factoring in some halfway-decent rest time for the driver, that’s still a lot quicker than the several-days-long container-ship-to-port-to-truck relay that moves goods to Fairbanks from the Port of Tacoma through Anchorage. But I wanted to confirm that assumption, and to know how much food actually came up the highway every year. I had visions of digging up delightful trivia: How many thousands of gallons of milk bounced over potholes to Alaska each year? How many loaves of bread?
I reached out to the Yukon Department of Highways and Public Works, which oversees the highway weigh station in Whitehorse that I’ve cycled and driven past countless times. The department replied apologetically that it didn’t have the data I wanted; it tracks cargo by weight, dimension and destination, but not by content. U.S. Customs and Border Protection couldn’t help either, I was told, because freight traveling through Canada to Alaska was considered neither an export nor an import, but rather “domestic in-transit freight,” and its contents were not inventoried at the border. The Canada Border Services Agency directed me to Statistics Canada, which didn’t keep data on such in-transit goods either.
These agencies did, however, share a few data points. Customs and Border Protection told me that in fiscal year 2024, 8,298 commercial freight-hauling trucks entered Alaska from the Yukon. That’s fewer than 23 trucks per day — not nearly enough to account for the roughly $2 billion worth of food that enters the state annually to feed its nearly 750,000 residents. Meanwhile, Statistics Canada was able to give me details on the foods that Canada exports directly to Alaska, as opposed to those it simply allows to pass through. In 2024, that list included salmon (fresh, frozen and smoked), cattle and buffalo, honey and seed potatoes, dried peas and lentils, cranberries and cumin, and an assortment of grains — durum wheat, barley, oats and malt. (It also included “caviar substitutes, prepared from fish eggs other than sturgeon,” and even Communion wafers. You’re welcome, Alaska.)










It takes 40 hours of nonstop driving to cover the 2,200 highway miles from Seattle to Fairbanks, a lot quicker than the several-days-long container-ship-to-truck relay that moves goods to Fairbanks from the Port of Tacoma.


I also contacted several grocery chains with multiple stores in Alaska, to see if they could tell me how much food they were bringing up the highway. I emailed the Alaska Commercial Company, Fred Meyer (via parent company Kroger), Carrs-Safeway (via parent company Albertsons), and Three Bears, but no one responded with the data I was looking for. It wasn’t until I talked to a woman named Kelly, who works in deliveries but wasn’t authorized to speak to me by her employer, a major grocery chain, that I realized the highway was something of a red herring. “I can’t speak for every grocery store,” she said, but “our stuff comes up on the barge, the vast majority of it.” They used to do more trucking, she explained, but despite its slower pace, shipping had proven consistently more reliable. Highway delays caused meat and milk to spoil, in particular, so they basically phased that out.
Rachel Lord, the advocacy and policy director for the Alaska Food Policy Council, confirmed Kelly’s comments. There are exceptions, she told me in a Zoom call from her office in Homer, but most of the state’s imported food now comes by container ship from Tacoma.
I told Lord that I had been struggling to find solid data on food imports, and she laughed. “It’s not you, it’s all of us,” she said. The data as I envisioned it — so many thousands of gallons of milk, so many loaves of bread — doesn’t yet exist in any coherent way. “It’s not there.”
It’s commonly said, for example, that 95% of Alaska’s food is imported. “There are no data citations you can pull for that,” Lord said. “It was mentioned by somebody at some point in some report, but there were no data citations associated with that, right? It’s a feeling, it’s probably fairly accurate, but it’s not — it’s just made up. But we can say the vast majority of the food that Alaskans buy at a store is imported from outside. That is solid.”

HILLARY PALMER IS AN Alaska-based program manager at Dewberry, a national design, planning and construction firm. She was the Alaska lead on the 2023 report commissioned by FEMA, so she has about as firm a grasp as anyone of just how vulnerable Alaska’s food supply chain is, and where its weak points lie.
According to Palmer’s report, roughly 4% of Alaska’s imported food comes via the AlCan. Walmart hauls a good chunk of that 4%, trucking its fresh meat and produce from Washington to seven of its nine Alaska locations. (Walmart’s Ketchikan and Kodiak stores are not on the road network.) “They haul with two drivers,” Palmer told me, “so that one can be sleeping while the other is driving.” Walmart has also developed specialized equipment to help protect the trucks’ chassis from frost heaves and other cold-weather damage to the road. Walmart’s team knows where the reliable refueling stops are located along the most remote stretches of the highway, and the drivers haul their own backup fuel, just in case.
But the retail behemoth is an outlier. Most of the rest of the state’s imported food comes by sea — and that brings its own logistical challenges.
In broad strokes, Alaska’s food supply chain currently looks like this. It’s important to remember that imports from the Lower 48, Canada, Mexico and elsewhere are only one piece of the picture — a big slice, but not the whole pie. “A huge amount of, especially rural Alaska, has subsistence wild foods that they rely on,” Rachel Lord says. That means salmon, of course, and caribou, and other fish and game, as well as foraged berries and plants and more. (Palmer’s report found that 65% of all the state’s residents, and 98% of the rural ones, engage in some form of subsistence food-gathering. Rural Alaskans, for whom rates of food insecurity can be twice as high as those living closer to cities and major roads, each harvest on average 300 pounds of wild food each year. Altogether, Alaskans consume somewhere between $450 million to $900 million worth of wild foods every year.)
And there’s been a surge of new farms in the state as well: The number grew by 30% from 2012 to 2017 in Alaska, while the United States as a whole saw a 3% decline. “We can’t grow avocados, but we can grow a lot,” said Lord — everything from livestock feed to fruits and vegetables, the latter sometimes supported by greenhouses or hydroponic systems. Alaska-raised meats and aquaculture products, like oysters, also are available, and there’s even a handful of vineyards.










For a state where many residents pride themselves on their self-sufficiency, their food supply is unusually dependent on public infrastructure.


But the traditional subsistence foods that nourished Alaska Natives for thousands of years before the gold-seekers arrived are beset by climate change and other man-made stressors, such as industrial fishing and habitat destruction from mining. And while the state’s agricultural sector is growing, it’s a long way from being able to replace all food imports; 43% of the state’s farms are less than 10 acres in size.
Which brings us back to the imports, what bush Alaskans sometimes call “store food.” Imports generally depart from the Port of Tacoma in Washington and spread out in three directions. Unalaska, in the Aleutian chain, receives direct shipments from Washington and then serves as a transport hub for southwest Alaska. Southeast Alaska, too, has a direct line to Tacoma, with shipments to Ketchikan, Juneau and beyond. But the vast majority of shipping crosses the Gulf of Alaska and heads for the Port of Alaska in Anchorage, where more than half the state’s population lives. Two large container shipping companies, TOTE and Matson, do the hauling, with deliveries arriving twice a week, and a complex network of barges, trucks and planes takes it from there, spooling out across the state’s vast interior.
“We are a ship-to-shelf state,” Lord said. “So when food comes into the port and goes out, it is, I’ve heard, anywhere from three to seven days’ worth of food. That is an extreme vulnerability.” (Kelly, the longtime grocery worker, agrees. “I have seen people on Facebook say, ‘Oh, surely they have stuff in the back room,’” she told me. “Well, we have a couple days’ worth.”)
In the Lower 48, by contrast, food is collected in regional distribution centers — whether it came from U.S. fields, off trucks from Mexico or elsewhere in the Americas, or by ship from Europe or Asia — before being doled out to individual stores, according to Benjamin Lorr, the author of The Secret Life of Groceries. Alaska lacks that middle step; even Hawai’i, in comparison, keeps up to two weeks’ worth of food in its warehouses at any given time.

Once the food has made its way to Alaska, whether by sea or by land, it faces a whole new tangle of logistical challenges. While a solid majority of Alaskans live along the state’s sparse road network, mostly concentrated in greater Anchorage, its semi-rural suburbs in the Mat-Su Borough, and in greater Fairbanks, 82% of the state’s communities are not reachable by road. The systems that carry food across all that land and water are vulnerable in myriad ways. Many small, fly-in communities are eligible for a subsidized air freight program administered by the U.S. Postal Service. Bypass Mail, as it’s called, is a lifeline — but it’s also, as Mike Jones, an economist at the University of Alaska Anchorage, explained, susceptible to delays and spoilage. As the food gets transferred from larger air carriers to much smaller ones, making its way from, say, Anchorage to Nome and then on to an array of often-icebound coastal villages, it sits in hangars and on airstrips. And sometimes it freezes. Or thaws. Or just goes off.
I’ve visited a few of those communities, with their thinly stocked store shelves and stratospheric prices. I’ve even been an ad hoc fruit-and-veg mule myself, hauling strawberries and kale salads and other produce onto passenger flights for the people I was visiting. I thought I understood the difficulties. But the system was even more precarious than I’d imagined.
The list of potential obstacles that Alaska’s incoming food must clear before it lands on anyone’s plate was dizzying. Palmer’s report grappled with everything from earthquakes, tsunamis and avalanches to cybersecurity, fuel availability and wildfires.
It struck me that, for a state where many residents pride themselves on their self-sufficiency — and Alaskans in general are some of the most quietly competent and resourceful folks I’ve ever met — their food supply was unusually dependent on public infrastructure. Down South, private sector producers might rely mainly on a functioning road network to get their food to private retailers. But in Alaska, so much more was in play, across ocean, land and air.
Keeping Alaska’s supply chain healthy is a shared effort — a civic project. And I might be biased, given my position on the other side of the border, but it seems to me that the biggest threat it faces is not some Canadian political bluster, but a failure to understand, and support, the role of public works and collective interventions in keeping the state fed. The Alaska Highway was, famously, completed in a matter of months. But the unglamorous task of maintaining port pilings and shipping berths, of filling potholes and keeping remote airport weather stations online, of caring for the herds of wild ungulates and schools of fish that feed people far from the nearest big-box grocery store — that work never ends.

(Photograph by Cherille Williams, courtesy of gallupARTS)A New Mexico arts organization on Thursday said it plans to decline a longstanding state grant that relies on federal funding, citing a new anti-DEI provision it says risks artistic freedom.
The New Mexico Arts for Partnership Agreement grant receives 50% of its funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, which requires the state agency to sign a federal contract.
The new agreement, signed in July, requires the 190-plus New Mexico grantees to “not operate any programs promoting ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI) that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.” Arts organizations have until Friday, Sept. 19 to formally accept the grant.
The board for the McKinley County-based nonprofit, gallupARTS, will refuse an award of $4,977 – about 5% of its operating budget — which the state has provided for about a decade.
Signing the contract is “tantamount to censorship,” Rose Eason, the executive director for the past decade, told Source NM.
“It is essential that we do not like to draw a hard line at protecting freedom of expression,” Eason said. “The highest and best kind of purpose of the arts is to foster dialogue and share ideas and cultivate empathy in our communities, and you can’t really advance the arts without standing up for freedom of expression and against censorship.”
New Mexico Arts, a division in the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs, confirmed to Source NM that three organizations have so far declined grants, and said the agency has also granted extensions to several other organizations that requested more time to make a decision.
New Mexico arts nonprofits reel from slashed federal funding

The grants agreement is “materially the same as prior years,” except for the explicit reminder to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws, said Michelle Laflamme-Childs, the executive director for New Mexico Arts in a statement.
“Nothing in NM Arts’ funding notice or final grant agreement prohibits organizations from continuing to run DEI programs or initiatives as long as those programs or initiatives do not violate federal anti-discrimination laws,” she said.
Laflamme-Childs continued to say that the agency hopes to maintain relationships with art organizations, and that they are “welcome to apply for funding again” in the future.
“We appreciate the position some nonprofits find themselves in and respect that each organization needs to make the decision that’s best for them when it comes to accepting public funding at this time,” she said.
The local responses comes as more than 1,000 artists nationwide and counting sign on to Collective Courage, described as a “national statement of solidarity” to allow artists to “maintain autonomy over programming choices, curatorial decisions, and artistic content.” The movement follows directives from the Trump Administration to review “divisive, race-centered ideology” and “remove improper ideology” from Smithsonian’s museums. This week the Trump Administration reportedly asked staff of the National Parks Service to remove the portrait of a formerly enslaved man.
“If they’re taking images and texts down about slavery, I think that brings it into focus, what this is really about,” Eason said. “It’s so important to push back against state-controlled art and media, if we believe in democracy.”
Eason said the issue lies solely with the federal government.
“I don’t want to come across in any way pointing the finger at New Mexico Arts, because it’s a problem that stems from the federal government and is impacting arts for the entire country,” she said.

(File/Platt/Getty Images)About 5,000 new electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids were sold in South Carolina during the first six months of 2025, a slight bump over the same time period last year, according to an annual report measuring EV adoption across the Southeast.
EVs and hybrids that can be plugged in to recharge made up a little more than 4% of total car sales in the Palmetto State in the first half of the year.
More than 32,000 all-electric vehicles are currently registered in the state, a fraction of the state’s 3.5 million total registrations, according to data from the SC Department of Motor Vehicles. The number of registered plug-in hybrids was not immediately available.
While South Carolina has gone all in trying to lure major EV and battery manufacturers to the state over the past five years, it’s next to last in the Southeast in terms of buyers, according to the sixth annual report put out by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

“Florida continues to be above the national average in terms of its market share, but most of the rest of the Southeast is either at or below,” said Nick Nigro, an analyst in Washington, D.C., whose firm, Atlas Public Policy, authored the report on behalf of the clean energy organization.
And a $7,500 tax credit aimed at lowering purchase costs and encouraging more U.S.-based manufacturing of these vehicles is about to expire at the end of the month.
EV sales across the country grew rapidly from 2020 to 2023. But despite continued sales growth overseas, U.S. sales have stalled out, holding steady at around 10% of the market.
“What will be the test for the near term in particular is what happens once that incentive goes away,” Nigro said during an online presentation of the report. “Many are thinking it’s going to crash the EV market.”
But Nigro says not so fast. To qualify for those tax credits in 2025, customers had to buy vehicles with batteries made up of 60% North American-made components. The vehicle itself also had to be assembled in North America.
“If you look at the data, probably about less than half of the vehicles that were being sold last year even qualified for the credit,” Nigro said. “So, a lot of vehicles were being purchased by Americans without the credit in place. Maybe it got them to the dealer, or maybe it helped them get more aware of EVs, but they were purchasing vehicles without the incentive.”
Without the credit, Nigro does expect the already lagging adoption of EVs in the U.S. to continue or slow further.
Volvo to add best-selling XC60 SUV to SC production lineup

Manufacturing in SC
In terms of South Carolina-made EVs, only Volvo’s plant in Ridgeville has cars rolling off the line — though the assembly facility is only operating at about 13% capacity, according to industry estimates.
The Swedish automaker produces its EX90 and Polestar 3 SUVs in the Lowcountry. But the XC90 has seen minimal success, with just 10,900 sold globally in the first eight months of 2025.
In July, Volvo announced it would pivot to add the popular XC60 hybrid SUV to its line of South Carolina-made models.
Meanwhile, BMW in the Upstate isn’t expected to begin producing its all-electric and hybrid iX5 until August 2026. The company has said it will offer six fully electric models by 2030.
Scout Motors, which is still constructing its $2 billion assembly plant in the Midlands, won’t start making its electric trucks and SUVs until 2027.
The Volkswagen subsidiary announced Thursday that, in addition to the assembly plan, it is investing $300 million to construct three buildings on its massive site that will house several of its suppliers. Of the deals it has inked so far with suppliers, Scout estimates those companies — which include firms both new and existing in the state — will invest $368 million and add 1,000 new jobs in the state to meet the automaker’s needs.
Since 2020, companies have announced nearly $13.3 billion in investments for EV and battery manufacturing in the state, with an estimated 13,400 new jobs, according to the clean energy organization’s report.
Electric vehicle battery company halts construction of SC manufacturing plant

Those numbers had been higher, but the state suffered a setback earlier this year, when battery cell maker Envision AESC in February first dialed back its planned jobs and investments and then in June halted construction altogether.
The Japanese-headquartered firm already has invested more than $1 billion into its facility in Florence, said spokesman Brad Grantham. He said the company “fully intends to meet our commitments to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs in the coming years,” but did not indicate what the new timeline might be. The company also pressed pause on a facility its constructing in Bowling Green, Kentucky.
AESC continues to operate a smaller facility in Smyrna, Tennessee, but the plant has switched to making batteries for storing energy generated by wind and solar, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Gregg Robinson, Florence County’s head of economic development, said the company continues to work through its issues, which include financing and cost increases driven by tariffs enacted this year by the Trump administration. The company is still contracted to supply battery cells for BMW’s plant in Spartanburg County.
“There was no doubt there was going to be a natural slowdown as the manufacturing that was announced was being built and came online,” Nigro said. “And there would eventually be some failures, because that’s the normal course of business. The question we need to keep in mind as we look ahead is how many of these potential cancelations that are happening now and into the future are because of federal policy or just because of the normal cycle of business?”
Nigro also points out that, while consumer tax credits for electric vehicles are ending, a roughly 10% tax credit for the manufacturing of certain battery parts is still in place following passage of Republican’s massive “big, beautiful” spending package. Phase outs begin in 2030.
“So, there is a signal that Washington wants a battery industry in this country,” Nigro said. “It’s just not exactly clear where we’re going to put all those batteries.”
SC can restart electric vehicle charging program after federal funding restored

Chargers in SC
South Carolina also remains behind the rest of the Southeast in terms of available electric vehicle chargers.
The state has 651 fast charging stations and 1,138 mid-level chargers, putting it at or near the bottom of the region in both categories on a per capita basis, according to the report.
But the state recently resubmitted plans to restart a federal program to increase its fast charger count.
South Carolina’s designated share of the $5 billion total set aside by Congress during the Biden administration is nearly $70 million.
The state had yet to spend any of its money on chargers when the Trump administration froze the funding in February. In June, a federal judge ordered the freeze to be lifted and the Federal Highway Administration, in August, gave states a month to resubmit applications.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/car-charging-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 18:57:14.940151

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)The Idaho Division of Financial Management is telling all Idaho state agencies and departments – other than public schools – to cut next year’s budget requests by 3%. The directive makes the budget holdbacks that Gov. Brad Little ordered for the current fiscal year permanent, budget documents provided by the state show. 
In addition to revising their base budgets down to make the 3% budget holdbacks permanent for fiscal year 2027 and beyond, all state agencies and departments other than public schools were told to eliminate all general fund budget requests for replacement items in next year’s fiscal year 2027 budget, state budget records show. 
Idaho state revenues continue to lag behind budget projections

Replacement items are a routine part of the budget process. Just as the term suggests, replacement items include requesting new equipment or vehicles to replace aging models, such as police cruisers for Idaho State Police, computers for state employees and heavy equipment used by the Idaho Department of Lands to fight wildfires. 
Instructions for the new cuts were included in a budget memo the Idaho Division of Financial Management, which is part of the executive office of the governor, sent to state agency directors and fiscal officers on Wednesday.
“This effort is about ensuring that Idaho government remains lean, efficient, and aligned with the values of our taxpayers,” Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff wrote in Wednesday’s budget memo. “By right-sizing government today, we strengthen our ability to fund the state’s highest priorities well into the future and create an even stronger economy.”

 The cuts for next fiscal year expand midyear budget holdbacks ordered by Gov. Little

Little first announced he was implementing 3% holdbacks for state agencies other than public schools for the current fiscal year 2026 on Aug. 15. Idaho’s fiscal year 2026 ends in June, and fiscal year 2027 starts in July. 
Wednesday’s budget memo expands that action by making the cuts ongoing in fiscal year 2027 and beyond. 
Under state law, all Idaho state agencies and departments submitted their fiscal year 2027 budget requests to the state prior to Sept. 1. This week’s new budget guidance means they have to take those requests back, reduce their base budgets by 3% and zero-out general fund replacement items, state records show. 
State agencies and departments have until Oct. 3 to submit their revised 2027 budget requests to the state. 
The budget holdbacks are occurring after the Idaho Legislature and Little reduced state revenue by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session to pay for a series of tax cuts and create a new education tax credit that reimburses families for education expenses including tuition at private religious schools.
In simplified terms, revenue is the amount of money the state has available to spend in the budget. 
The Idaho Constitution prohibits the state from spending more money than available revenue. 
 Idaho’s state revenues are coming in lower than estimated

Since the Idaho Legislature and Little approved reducing state revenue by more than $450 million, state revenues have come in below projections.

Through the first two months of the current fiscal year 2026, state revenues have come in $22.6 million, or 2.8% below the Division of Financial Management’s revised revenue forecast.
Idaho legislators planned to end fiscal year 2026 with a $439.8 million ending balance, or surplus. However, since the Idaho Legislature adjourned in April, that projected ending balance has decreased to an estimated $21.8 million as revenues lag behind projections. 
Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said the state is facing budget holdbacks and revenue shortfalls because of what she described as “gross negligence” by the Idaho Legislature and Little. 
Wintrow said it was completely irresponsible for the Idaho Legislature and Little to reduce state revenue by more than $450 million.
“I wish I could say I was surprised, but it doesn’t make it any less infuriating,” Wintrow said Thursday afternoon.
The state’s projected $21.8 million ending balance may not tell the full budget story. 
That projection does not include a $60 million supplemental funding request the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said it needs to pay its Medicaid bills. The projection also does not include the cost of conforming to the tax changes included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act President Donald Trump signed into law July 4.
One outside estimate by the nonprofit Tax Foundation estimates it could cost Idaho another $167 million to conform to tax changes such as no tax on workers’ tips, no tax on employee overtime, no tax on borrower’s car loan interest and an expanded senior deduction. 
Because of the cost of the tax changes and the $60 million supplemental funding request, the state could actually be facing a $200 million deficit, not a $21.8 million surplus, House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, warned this week.
Wintrow said the Idaho Legislature and Little need to take responsibility for cutting revenue so deeply and spending more money on tax cuts that she says the state cannot afford.  
“Just because you say something over and over again doesn’t make it the truth,” Wintrow said. “Just because you say, ‘We’re being lean and efficient,’ – no, it’s not true! It is because you cut the revenue stream too hard, and I think knowingly so. You can quote me on this: I think the best term for it is gross negligence.”
With nearly 10 months still to go in the current fiscal year 2026, state officials said Thursday there is still time for revenues to rebound and increase, or to fall even further behind forecasts. State officials did not rule out the possibility that additional budget cuts could still be necessary in order to balance the fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2027 budgets.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)WATFORD CITY, N.D. – Natural gas is going to be the “savior” of the power grid.
That was the message from David Coker, chief executive officer of One Power Solutions, during the North Dakota Petroleum Council’s annual meeting Thursday. 
“People are starting to realize it now. We have a power problem in this nation,” Coker said. “Natural gas is the solution to our power problem.”
That’s good news for North Dakota, which produces more than 3.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.
Meanwhile, the demand for artificial intelligence is growing so rapidly that the power generation needed is expected to reach 50 gigawatts by 2028, according to Todd Slawson, chair of the North Dakota Petroleum Foundation. 
“Fifty gigawatts is like building another California,” Slawson said. 
Nick Phillips, vice president of Applied Digital, the company behind the Harwood and Ellendale data centers, said North Dakota is a prime location for future data center development in many ways. The access to power generation and lower cooling costs are big factors. Phillips expects more companies to begin developing the facilities in North Dakota in the near future. 
“It’s still early,” Phillips said. “We’re really on the leading edge of this.”
Applied Digital’s two data center projects are on the eastern edge of the state, despite western North Dakota being the source of natural gas for power generation. Phillips said being closer to population centers can be a benefit in terms of workforce, but he said it’s plausible for future data center development to occur in other parts of the state. 
But one potential road block to rapid construction of data centers in the western half of the state, beyond workforce shortages, is power generation. 
“We have plans for every electron we can make,” Gavin McCollam, vice president of Basin Electric Power Cooperative, said. “We don’t have a lot of spare generation.”
Basin Electric just completed work on Phase IV of the Pioneer Generation Station near Williston, adding 600 megawatts to its generation capacity, and on the same day broke ground on the Bison Generation Power Station. The latter, McCollam said, will be the largest in the state. Both are fueled by natural gas.
Neither is being built to supply data centers and artificial intelligence. The power generation is needed to supply Basin Electric’s existing consumer base. 
Basin Electric has had 10 formal requests for sites needing a large amount of power through the cooperative’s Large Load Program, an initiative launched earlier this year with the goal “to insulate our members from the cost of adding generation for data.” 
Those 10 requests, McCollam said, add up to 5,000 megawatts. “It’s almost double our existing generation capabilities,” he said. “There’s certainly a disconnect there that needs to be managed very carefully. It reminds me a little bit of the oil and gas boom.”
Rainbow Energy, the owner of the coal-fired Coal Creek Station power plant in central North Dakota, is already providing the energy for one data center and is making plans to power more. Jeff Jonson, president of the company, said Rainbow Energy will have 415 megawatts of spare generation available for artificial intelligence by mid-2026, with additional talks ongoing with potential customers. 
He said Rainbow Energy is also planning to add 2,100 megawatts of additional power generation, “an enormous load,” using natural gas shipped east from the Bakken.

Chevron enters the Bakken
The oil industry meeting also featured a representative from Chevron, which recently became a player in North Dakota’s oil field with the acquisition of Hess Corp.
Chevron, one of the largest oil companies in the world, has big plans for the Bakken, a company official told the crowd. Hess’ North Dakota operations will be officially integrated into Chevron Oct. 1. 
“There is a lot of commonality between Chevron and Hess and the cultures. Especially when it comes to safety and the environment,” said Kim McHugh, a vice president of a division for Chevron, during a one-on-one conversation with Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council. “We are in a good starting point together.”
She said one internal goal of Chevron’s is finding a way to double the amount of oil recovered from unconventional assets, such as the Bakken. Finding the key to enhanced oil recovery, she said, is going to make or break that goal. 
Ness said he’s excited a company as large as Chevron is about to enter North Dakota’s oil and gas industry. 
“I think you interject a whole new group of ideas into the basin,” Ness said. 
McHugh said they’ve already observed places in Hess’ operations where there is room for improvement, though it’s still early days yet. 
“We’re just getting behind the curtain,” McHugh said. “What I can say is we see opportunity to continue to improve on the performance there.”
Chevron’s vice president emphasized the need for the company to build relationships with landowners and communities. 
“You cannot build those relationships when you’re in a bind,” she said. “You’ve got to build them way ahead of that.”

(Photo via Lone Peak Film Festival)A film festival geared toward showing “uplifting” movies and shorts is coming to Big Sky this weekend.
It’s the first year for the Lone Peak Film Festival in Big Sky, which will have six feature films and 16 shorts. The event will also include a mentorship program for local Native American filmmakers. 
Feature films include “Bring Them Home (Aiskótáhkapiyaaya),” “Lost Wolves of Yellowstone,” “Champions of the Golden Valley,” “Runa Simi,” “Sing Sing” and “Cutting Through the Rocks.”
The festival starts on Friday and runs through Sunday, with a mixture of free and paid events throughout the weekend.
“They’re all uplifting. So they all focus a light on the good in humanity. There’s no denying that there’s a lot of bad stuff going on,” said Daniel Glick, who helped found the festival. “But we also want to highlight that there are a lot of people who are trying to make the world a bit more sane and healthy too.”
The film festival is also in part sponsored by the state Department of Commerce, and Montana has long been a home for filmmakers. The state passed legislation earlier this year to extend a film tax credit and also sought to fix a problem, which was film tax credits getting sucked up by large productions, namely “Yellowstone.”
Senate Bill 326 brought by Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson sought to address the issue. It had a somewhat dramatic path before being signed by Gov. Greg Gianforte — the bill was killed and revived and drew significant floor discussion. It also was one of the final bills the legislature passed during the 2025 session.
“We need the big guys, but more importantly, we need the little guys too, to make sure that they grow and prosper,” Hertz said in a House Taxation committee meeting on April 15. “And it all works out for Montana. We also have additional incentives to hire veterans and Native Americans into the bill.”
SB 326 will provide $12 million per year to the film industry in Montana, and some of that money will go to Montana production companies and small filmmakers. The bill also extended the tax credit until 2045.
Movie productions are incredibly expensive, said Glick, who described a film he wants to shoot on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. The problem is, he said, without production credits, it’s hard to find investors, and he may be forced to shoot a film across the border in Canada.
“There’s a huge, huge appetite for people to make films here, like locals, every filmmaker in Montana that I know wants to make multiple films in Montana … all of them have stories set here in Montana. But without that kind of incentive, it’s just very hard to get the investment needed,” Glick said. “… Filmmaking is a high risk venture, and so you need people willing to take the risk. And those credits are a way to incentivize investors.”
Events like the Big Sky Film Festival in Missoula draw crowds, and the expectation is Lone Peak will too. Organizers of the Lone Peak event spent time in the Big Sky area, seeing if there was appetite in the community for the festival, Glick said.
“Pretty much all the way to everyone we talked to said, ‘Yeah, the community would love this.’” Glick said. “So we moved ahead. And it wasn’t until three months ago that we decided to actually pull the trigger and say, ‘We’re going to do it.’ So …it’s been a rocket ship since then.”
The festival will also include opportunities for those aspiring for careers in the filmmaking industry, including Chase Hall and Destini Vaile. They’ll get a chance to meet people and be mentees.
Hall is the son of a stuntman and said his dad has done stunts for major productions, including the “Magnificent 7” and “Yellowstone.” His interest came early.
“I was exposed to a decent amount of film sets,” Hall said on Thursday.
He said he was a little nervous about this weekend but excited for the mentorship. Hall is from Browning and graduated from Montana State University with a degree in film studies.
He said he likes to focus on the theme of identity, and a previous mentor observed the same in his work.
“They noticed my work kind of goes through exploring identity as a contemporary Native American, through the lens of surrealism,” Hall said.
Vaile recently finished her master’s of fine arts at the University of Montana. She’s created scripts for a couple of projects, including “Cereal,” which is about a 15-year old having a daily breakfast with her grandmother in the month before she died. 
“It’s a bit autobiographical, but, you know, somewhat fictionalized, to just draw out the core of the story … I was staying with her a lot, and we would just have breakfast in the morning and talk about things,” Vaile said. “So it’s kind of just trying to capture that moment.”
She also enjoyed the time she spent at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Sante Fe, New Mexico. There, she said, she had the ability to express a creative vision with the lens of her culture.
Her cohort at the University of Montana was all women, which she said was a good experience.
“It was just nice to experience that with just really capable, skilled women with, like, a vision,” Vaile said.

After hearing Thursday from university student governments about their plans for how funds would be used, student Regent Lucy Gipple introduced a motion to add a $1 million request to the fiscal year 2027 state appropriation ask, to go toward mental health support and resources.
Regent Greta Rouse also supported the motion, saying that mental health is something both she and the students she’s interacted with are passionate about.
“It’s very clear that … this money will be put into good goals,” Gipple said.

The University of Iowa, Iowa State University and University of Northern Iowa have requested their general university allocations from the state be kept steady for the upcoming fiscal year, but each institution proposed programs pertaining to health care, agriculture, technology and new tuition plans.
Brad Berg, board of regents chief business officer, said during the meeting the incremental funding requests from the three universities total $8.8 million in new appropriations. With the addition of $1 million for mental health, new funding will come in at just under $10 million if the Iowa Legislature approves the requests.
Regent Robert Cramer said during the meeting board committees worked with university presidents to advise on what funding priorities they should target, leading to the decision to keep general funding flat in favor of asking for appropriations in specific areas.
Regent David Barker, the only “no” vote on the board for including mental health funding, said during the meeting there may be people outside of the universities who may need mental health support more than students, and the board needs to consider its fiduciary responsibility to Iowa taxpayers.
He commended the students on the “very well-thought-out proposal,” which has come before the board in past years, but pointed out that money allocated to this effort is money not spent on other efforts that may have a greater need.
“We provide oversight over the universities, but our ultimate duty is to the taxpayers of Iowa,” Barker said.
While she said she respected what Barker was saying, Rouse said the board is “here to advocate for students and the universities,” and lawmakers don’t have to fund the addition if they choose not to.
If board members wish to support the institutions and their leaders, who presented to the board on retention rates and other data, Gipple said seeking this funding will do just that, as well as help students and hopefully avoid potential mental health crises.
The UI’s retention rate has grown to 90.9%, university president Barbara Wilson said in her presentation to the board, after hitting its goal of 90% retention within three years instead of the projected five. She added the university admits 80% of its application pool.
“I wouldn’t feel comfortable moving to do this if it wasn’t something I truly believed was necessary,” Gipple said.

(Photo by Leah Romero for SourceNM)U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico and 12 other Senate Democrats are calling on the Federal Communications Commission chairman to defend his recent comments about late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, saying his effort to censor the host made the commission effectively a “roving press censor, targeting broadcasters based on their political commentary.”
Disney, ABC’s parent company, announced Wednesday it was indefinitely canceling Kimmel’s show, following comments Kimmel made on air about Republicans’ efforts to distance themselves from the suspect accused of assassinating right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk. 
Disney’s announcement came after owners of ABC affiliates nationwide said they were refusing to air Kimmel’s show, and after FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested the FCC would go after the broadcast licenses of ABC affiliates who continued to air Kimmel’s show, saying the FCC “can do this the easy way or the hard way.”
Luján and other Democrats said in a letter Thursday that Carr’s threats were “outrageous and a betrayal of the FCC’s mission,” which is to act in the public interest and not favor one political viewpoint over another. 
“We urge you to immediately stop threatening media organizations due to their programming and return to the FCC’s mission of ensuring all Americans have access to affordable, efficient communication services,” the Democrats wrote in the Thursday letter.
In addition to the criticism, the lawmakers called on Carr to answer questions by Sept. 25 about his “easy way” or “hard way” comments, along with how the FCC is defining ideological bias or if it has adopted a new standard for being politically neutral. 
The lawmakers also are asking for communications, if they exist, between Carr or any other FCC staff and Disney, ABC or affiliates about Kimmel or his controversial monologue on Monday. 
Earlier Thursday, Luján posted a statement on social media that read: “President Trump and FCC Chair Carr made it clear: fall in line or be silenced. And it’s not just late night TV.

Marianne Proctor speaks during a meeting. (LRC Public Information)A Kentucky Republican is hoping to define grooming of a child in state law and criminalize it under a proposal she presented Thursday. 
Rep. Marianne Proctor, of Union, said the goal of her bill would be to define what a “groomer” is, as there is no state law that has a definition or criminalizes that behavior. She presented the idea to members of the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary. 
“It has become an increasing problem,” Proctor said. 
Lawmakers often debate possible legislation in the interim ahead of the next legislative session, starting in January.
A draft version of the legislation says that an adult would be guilty of grooming a minor under the age of 14 if they have “intent to entice, coerce, solicit, or prepare the minor to engage in sexual conduct with the person or another person” or are a person of authority over a minor with such intention. Violating the law would be a Class A misdemeanor, unless the victim is under the age of 12, which would be a Class D felony, with a possible sentence of one to five years in prison. 
Joining Proctor’s presentation was Louis Kelly, the commonwealth’s attorney for Boone and Gallatin counties. He said that many rape cases involve a history of a relationship before escalating into a criminal act.
“What this would do would be to allow us to identify and prosecute and stop this in its tracks before it crosses the line into actually enticing or eliciting sex, or, God forbid, an actual sexual conduct (situation),” Kelly said. 
At present, the bill does have provisions to address people who have to communicate with minors for legitimate purposes and further outlines intent, Kelly said. However, the bill could be refined before the legislative session begins in a few months. 
The legislation got bipartisan support from committee members, but some lawmakers still had questions about how broad and how narrow Proctor’s bill should be. 
Republican Rep. T.J. Roberts, of Burlington, said “protecting our children is one of the highest duties that we have as a legislature” and the bill would do that. However, he said states with similar laws state that someone could be liable for grooming if they believe the victim is a minor even if the victim is over 18.  
House Democratic Whip Rep. Lindsey Burke, of Lexington, said that she views the draft as having narrow definitions but that it could be widened to encompass other possible victims and perpetrators, including some perpetrators younger than 18. She gave an example of a 17-year-old grooming a much younger child and wondered if “we’re going to miss, potentially, very damaging conduct.” 
“We need to do everything we can to ensure that young people are safe when they’re at school, when they’re at home, when they’re in the community, and I do think this bill is going in the right direction,” Burke said. 
Other states that have passed recent laws banning grooming of a minor include Ohio and Louisiana.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Proctor-1024x604.jpg,,,2025-09-18 18:57:14.940151

Ahead of a CDC meeting expected to restrict access to vaccines, the department’s leaders said they will follow independent medical associations’ recommendations.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Department of Health issues broad guidance on vaccines for respiratory viruses and extends pharmacy access for Covid-19 booster .","A dose of COVID-19 vaccine is held by pharmacist Hayley Hooks at Kinney Drugs in Essex Junction on Wednesday, September 10, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
The Vermont Department of Health issued its vaccine recommendations on respiratory viruses Thursday and authorized Vermont pharmacies to give anyone age five and over access to a Covid-19 booster shot through a standing order.
“The recommendations are the most important thing so that it is clear for Vermonters and for providers what the health department position is on the COVID-19 vaccine,” interim Health Commissioner Julie Arel said in an interview with VTDigger. “The standing order is a tool to try to help support pharmacists to be able to administer the vaccine.”
Both the recommendations and the standing order follow the guidance of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, according to the department guidance.
The Vermont Health Department recommends that anyone 6 months old and above get the Covid-19 vaccine. 
“We think anybody who wants a vaccine should be able to get one, but there are certain populations that we think it’s even more important to have them get the vaccine,” Arel said. 
Babies between 6 to 24 months see higher rates of hospitalization from Covid-19 and should get vaccinated to prevent the risk of severe illness, Arel added. Vaccination is also particularly important for pregnant people, who can confer immunity in utero; it serves as critical protection for babies before they are old enough to receive a vaccine. The department’s recommendations also underscore the importance for people 65 years old or older and individuals with existing health conditions to get the shots. 
The Health Department releases vaccine recommendations every year — which includes guidance on RSV and flu vaccination as well. This year, however, the recommendations served to provide added clarity against a backdrop of confusion surrounding the federal guidelines and approvals on vaccinations.
The state’s recommendations come on the same day that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel began to discuss and vote on Covid-19 vaccine recommendations. Many state public health officials have watched closely to see what the panel may suggest, after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stacked the panel with vaccine skeptics.
In August, the Food and Drug Administration authorized updated Covid-19 vaccines for this upcoming cold and flu season with the guidance that they should be administered to those 65 and above or with existing health risks. That does not prevent doctors from offering an “off-label” prescription, which a health care provider can give outside the scope of FDA approval.
Vermont’s standing order gives pharmacies room to administer the updated Covid-19 vaccines without having the patient attest to a prior health risk.
The order strives to make it as easy as possible for pharmacies to issue the vaccines this way, Arel said. “[Off-lable use] is a pretty accepted practice, but it’s a little bit different for pharmacists, and so this is just a way to try to help smooth the path for them to be able to get those vaccines out to more people.” 
Right now, pharmacies are the only sites in the state that have this season’s Covid-19 vaccines. Doctors’ offices and other clinics, which often get vaccines from the CDC via the state, have not been able to order the vaccines from the federal government. Pharmacies, on the other hand, order vaccines directly from the manufacturer, and thus they have been able to move forward with administering the vaccine.
However, Vermont state law prevents pharmacies from administering vaccines to children under five years old, meaning that this population will have to wait until the vaccines land in their pediatricians’ offices. 
“I know it’s frustrating for parents to not be able to get the vaccine yet for their children,” said Arel. “We have to wait for the CDC to make it available for us to order through the usual pathways.” 
She anticipates that the vaccines will arrive in Vermont by early to mid- October.
On Thursday, a group of Northeastern states also formalized its coalition to collaborate on public health guidance, as the Northeast Public Health Collaborative. Vermont state health officials attended preliminary meetings of the collaborative but issued its recommendations on respiratory illness independently from the coalition today — despite publicizing the recommendations on the same day as the block of Northeastern states. 
Both of the state’s private insurers — Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT and MVP — confirmed to VTDigger earlier in September that they intend to continue covering COVID-19 vaccines at no cost and with no prior approval. The health department’s recommendations confirm that Medicaid will continue to cover the cost of the shots, and since the FDA has already approved the vaccine for those over 65 or with existing health risks, Medicare, which covers the same age group, should also cover the vaccines. 
The only unknown, Arel said, are employer-sponsored insurance plans, which are federally regulated.
“It really behooves folks to cover the vaccine,” she said. “It helps to prevent the most severe storms of the disease.” 
“Getting vaccinated is the best way for us to protect ourselves and others, especially as we head into the fall season,” Governor Phil Scott said in a press release his office issued highlighting the order. “This order is a necessary step to make sure those who want a vaccine, can get one.”
The order is effective until August 31, 2026, unless rescinded earlier.

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)With the U.S. Food and Drug Administration placing new restrictions on eligibility for the updated COVID-19 vaccine, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has signed an executive directive intended to ensure vaccines remain accessible ahead of cold and flu season.
Under the FDA’s updated guidance, eligibility is limited to individuals 65 and older and individuals ages five to 64 with at least one underlying health condition putting them at high risk for severe outcomes from the virus, where the vaccine was previously available to anyone six months or older.
However, the governor’s directive, issued Wednesday, instructs state agencies to identify and remove any barriers to accessing COVID-19 vaccines. 



Specifically, the directive instructs departments to:

Issue clear, accessible guidance to pharmacists, providers, and the public about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine; 
Issue guidance instructing pharmacists and providers to encourage prescribing and administering COVID-19 vaccines to patients; 
Identify, review, and remove barriers to vaccine access to ensure COVID-19 vaccines remain widely available in Michigan; and
Ensure, to the extent possible, that all health insurance plans under the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ and the Department of Insurance and Financial Services’ regulatory authority – including Medicaid and insurance plans in the individual, small group, and large group markets – cover COVID-19 vaccines




“Cold, flu, and COVID-19 season are upon us. We all have a role to play in keeping our communities safe and healthy,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Today’s executive directive ensures Michiganders can get the COVID-19 vaccine. According to medical experts, vaccines remain the most effective way to stay healthy. I’m committed to providing Michiganders with the best options for their families.” 
The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Family Physicians have all issued their own guidance continuing to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine to protect against infection.
Research from the health department also found the 2023-2024  COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of COVID-19-associated emergency room and urgent care visits by 65-70% for children in the first two months after vaccination.
“It is incredibly important for Michiganders to get vaccinated this cold, flu, and COVID-19 season,” Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state’s chief medical executive, said in a statement. “Protecting ourselves from cold, flu, and COVID-19 also protects our loved ones, our hospitals, health care workers, and so many more. With this executive directive, we’re connecting Michiganders with trusted resources from medical experts and helping more families get the safe and effective flu and COVID-19 vaccines. We encourage Michiganders to speak with their healthcare providers as they prepare for this season.”

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Fatumo Mohid arrived in the United States about 18 months ago determined to build a new life with her three young children.
A refugee from Somalia, Mohid said she had little formal education or resources at her disposal. She couldn’t drive, so she used to walk to work and school — sometimes in subzero temperatures
In the past year-and-a-half, the Fargo resident has earned her driver’s license, started a job at Amazon and made impressive progress in her English language skills, according to her teacher, Amy Rand. She’s also earned a reputation as a welcoming and supportive presence in her school’s community.
Educators of adult learners came together Thursday to celebrate success stories like Mohid’s at a conference for the North Dakota Association for Lifelong Learners at the Capitol in Bismarck. During the ceremony, Mohid was recognized as the association’s 2025 student of the year.
Rand read prepared remarks from Mohid accepting the award.
“In Somalia, many people believe that a mother with children cannot go to school or succeed,” Mohid said in the speech. “Today, I stand here proudly to say that I proved them wrong.”
North Dakota has 12 adult learning centers across the state. They focus on helping North Dakotans who don’t have a high school diploma, are learning English or lack basic job skills, said Sara Mitzel, state director for adult education at the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction.
The goal is to get students ready for the workforce or higher education, Mitzel said.

Many students like Mohid must juggle classwork with other responsibilities like family and work, sometimes while lacking reliable transportation, Jennifer Frueh, director of the Adult Learning Center in Fargo. 
She said adult educators work hard to help their students navigate their life outside of the classroom.
“It could be talking about housing, health care, parenting — it’s all the things that go into supporting a whole student,” she said.
Mohid said in her speech that she looks forward to strengthening her English skills and to supporting her kids’ bright futures.
“I accept this award, not just for myself, but for every parent out there working tirelessly to create a better future for their children,” she said.
The ceremony also recognized Xander Ridley, originally from Glyndon, Minnesota, who earned the highest GED score in North Dakota over the past year.
He plans to attend Minot State University and eventually become an electrician.
Ridley earned his GED in less than a month. To earn a GED, a student must pass a series of tests lasting more than six hours combined, Frueh noted.
“It’s not an easy feat to obtain the highest GED score,” she said. “The fortitude to get through the testing process itself is a long process.”

(Screenshot from AirNow.gov)Ground-level ozone concentrations in Central Arkansas exceeded ambient air quality standards Thursday, prompting an advisory from the state’s environmental regulator.
The Division of Environmental Quality said forecasts show that ozone concentrations will exceed 70 parts per million in the air, which is the baseline for issuing a “Code Orange” air quality advisory, according to a news release.
The EPA’s Air Quality Index has four levels. Green indicates good air quality, yellow indicates moderate air quality, orange represents unhealthy air pollution levels for sensitive groups and red represents unhealthy air pollution for all groups.
According to data from DEQ air monitoring stations, the most recent ozone concentration was 74 parts per million. Levels are expected to drop to 56 parts per million — into the yellow range — tomorrow, according to DEQ forecasts.
Ground-level ozone can be harmful — unlike ozone in the stratosphere, which protects the planet from ultraviolet solar radiation. Even “relatively low levels” of ground-level ozone can be harmful to people’s health, according to the EPA, and can cause symptoms such as coughing and difficulty taking deep breaths, as well as increased susceptibility to infection. Those most vulnerable to higher ozone concentrations include people with asthma, children and older adults, and those who are active outdoors.
Long-term exposure to ozone has also been linked to the development of asthma.
“An Ozone Action Day is declared when the AQI [Air Quality Index] is forecasted to be Code Orange or higher,” DEQ said in a press release. “On an Ozone Action Day, young children, the elderly, and those with respiratory problems, such as asthma, emphysema, and bronchitis, are especially vulnerable to the effects of air pollution and should limit outdoor activities.”
Ambient air quality standards — or the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) — dictate how much of certain pollutants like ozone can be present in an area’s air. Environmental regulators are required to set these standards by the Clean Air Act, first passed in 1990.
The NAAQS regulate six pollutants: ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. These pollutants, called criteria or primary pollutants, are the basis of large parts of air quality regulation in the United States.
If a region struggles to meet the standards for the pollutants, that could affect what those with air permits are allowed to emit from their facilities.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Image-9-18-25-at-2.41 PM-1024x700.jpeg,,,2025-09-18 17:58:02.118885

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Lyft paid the state of New Jersey $19.4 million to resolve allegations that the company misclassified its drivers as independent contractors, state Department of Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo announced Thursday.
The payment includes $10.8 million for unemployment, family leave, and disability taxes that labor authorities said the firm had failed to pay between 2014 and 2017, plus $8.5 million in penalties and interest.
An independent contractor designation makes workers ineligible for family leave, unemployment, and disability benefits and exempts their employers from the payroll taxes that fund those benefits.
“Misclassification imposes a financial toll on both good actor employers and misclassified workers, who lose critical rights such as minimum wage, overtime pay, workers’ compensation coverage, unemployment insurance, earned sick leave, family leave, and more,” Asaro-Angelo said in a statement.
The Lyft payment comes as labor officials are considering new rules that would upend how ride-hail services classify their drivers.
Companies like Uber, which in 2022 paid New Jersey $100 million to resolve more than $600 million in misclassification claims between 2014 and 2018, and Lyft have long maintained their role is limited to connecting drivers with passengers and that their workers are independent contractors.
State labor officials sought payment of past due contributions following an audit of Lyft prompted by some of its drivers seeking unemployment and disability benefits, the agency said.
The firm contested the determination in 2022 but withdrew its challenge in August, days ahead of a hearing before an administrative law judge, state officials said Thursday. It had earlier paid $10.8 million, which was assessed in unpaid contributions to prevent the balance from accruing interest, they said.
“We will not allow businesses to exploit workers by misclassifying them, stripping employees of essential benefits and avoiding their responsibility to support programs that protect our workforce,” Attorney General Matt Platkin, whose office represented the Department of Labor, said in a statement.
Lyft did not immediately return a request for comment.
State officials are weighing new rules to regulate New Jersey’s ABC test, which measures whether a worker is an employee entitled to unemployment, family leave, and disability benefits or an independent contractor who is not required to pay into the funds that fuel those benefits.
Proposed regulations for the test’s second prong — which measures whether a worker’s services are performed outside the usual course or place of an employer’s business — could solidify rules around ride-hailing employment.
Examples included in the proposed rule’s text would designate ride-hailing drivers’ vehicles as a place of business for the companies. Because a worker must meet all three of the ABC test’s prongs, the rule would effectively bar ride-hailing drivers from being classed as independent contractors.

Gallop Franklin (D-Tallahassee) in Tampa on Sept. 18, 2026. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — A bipartisan pair of state lawmakers spent 90 minutes Thursday hearing from healthcare professionals about what is wrong with the system in Florida and what might be done to change it.
Contending that all healthcare is local, Florida state Rep. Gallop Franklin (D-Tallahassee) has been holding roundtable discussions with physicians, hospital administrators, members of provider organizations, and academic institutions around the state to gain insight about the biggest problems in the system.
After previous meetings in Miami and Tallahassee, Franklin came to Tampa Thursday, where he co-chaired a roundtable discussion with state Rep. Adam Anderson (R-Tarpon Springs) and more than three dozen healthcare professionals at the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine.
With dozens of issues to contend with, Franklin, a pharmacist, said the goal of these meetings is to “try to synthesize and digest what are some of the lower-hanging fruit that we might get done faster and what are some of the larger complicating issues that’s going to take additional meetings and additional work.”
“We’re really trying to drive a better quality of life for patient outcomes, and it’s good to have all perspectives to do that, and so there’s a ton of ideas that you heard today,” he added following the meeting.
Among the problems that the panelists discussed were frustrations with Medicare Advantage plans, workforce shortages, and credentialing delays for healthcare workers
Ghost networks
Rosemarie Latham, government affairs chair with the Florida Association of Nurse Practitioners, said “ghost networks” are adding to the lack of available physicians in a community.
Ghost networks refer to providers being listed in a health plan’s provider directory who aren’t available to provide care as indicated. Studies have shown that it’s common to encounter these networks while looking for care.

“The payers keep a list of who their providers are,” she said. “That list is not current. That list can include dead providers. That list can include providers who are no longer practicing. That list can include providers on multiple lists, because when they are credentialed, they need to be credentialed at an address.
“So, if an organization has multiple sites in which they provide care, that provider needs to be credentialed at each of the sites. So, that is falsely and erroneously inflating the amount of providers that are available. That is wrong, and that is resulting in providers not able to be empanelled, credentialed, whatever verbiage that you would want to use to become network providers, because they are denied because there are [supposedly] enough providers in the area. It is a false narrative. Ghost networks need to be rectified quickly.”
There were complaints about reimbursement payments.
“All across the state, with the exception of Miami-Dade … we’re struggling with EMTs and paramedics to get them to go to school to make a wage that’s supported by a reimbursement rate that’s woefully low,” said Terence Ramotar, director of government affairs with the Florida Ambulance Association.
The cost in Florida for an ambulance ride can range from $600-1,000, he said. Medicaid, he continued, pays only $136 per trip with no mileage.
“Funding is the most important, right? We are trying to get EMTs in this area. Thirteen, fourteen bucks an hour? Amazon’s a better option.
“But we can’t get the reimbursement. Most of our stuff is government-funded, or commercial insurance-funded. All of which under-reimburses the cost. So that ends up backing up the entire system. So we have to get there. The emergencies come first, which are inundated, and then we have to prioritize the non-emergency [calls] and then ensure that we can make payroll. It’s a scary world.”
Rep. Anderson, chairman of the Health Care Facilities & Systems Subcommittee, told the attendees at the conclusion of the meeting that it was vitally important to get their input. But he acknowledged that legislative remedies may not be imminent.
“These things can take a long time to fix, right?” he said. “Sometimes these larger initiatives are procedures that take multiple years, multiple sessions to get things done. So don’t be discouraged if you don’t see some progress at the beginning of this session that’s coming up.”
Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare
Meanwhile, a major healthcare decision is scheduled to take place in Florida’s capital city next month.
Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare (THM) and Florida State University have reached a tentative agreement after months of negotiating. THM would become a part of FSU Health, with the university taking control of all city-owned assets of the hospital, as reported by the Tallahassee Democrat. That is, if the Tallahassee City Commission approves the deal sometime in October.
Franklin said he supports the general idea of having an academic hospital system, but that the question is what the structure of such a partnership would look like.
“Should it be how it is where the local government still owns the property and then there’s an engagement between, FSU being with TMH in a way that works for both of them?” he said. “Should that structure be where Florida State actually owns the property? Should it be where TMH owns that property, right? So I think that structure is the more complicated part.”
Franklin added that he intends to hold future roundtable healthcare discussions in Broward County, Orlando, the Naples-Fort Myers region, Jacksonville, and a location in the Panhandle, possibly Pensacola.

According to state records, Genevieve Dowding was employed earlier this year as the social services director for Harmony Dubuque, a nursing home run by Legacy Healthcare Financial Services.
She was fired in April 2025 when her employer concluded she had violated rules prohibiting the falsification of documents, according to the records.
According to the recent findings of an administrative law judge, a resident was admitted to the facility on April 18, 2025, and Dowding was tasked with obtaining the resident’s signatures on all of the documents related to the admission. After Dowding notified the home’s administrator, Cassandra Wood, that the documents were signed and completed, Wood allegedly reviewed the documents and saw the resident’s electronic signature had been added to the documents at 3:07 p.m., 3:10 p.m., 3:14 p.m., 3:15 p.m. and 5:12 p.m.
Suspecting that Dowding was in her office at those times and that the resident was not present, Wood reviewed surveillance camera footage and allegedly confirmed Dowding had been alone in her office when the signatures were collected.
When Wood inquired about the matter, Dowding allegedly admitted that she had forged the resident’s signatures and offered no explanation for her conduct. The facility fired Dowding, after which she collected $3,516 in unemployment benefits. Legacy Healthcare Financial Services objected, and the matter went to a hearing before an administrative law judge.
The judge, Elizabeth Johnson, ruled recently that Dowding is not entitled to unemployment benefits, finding there was credible testimony that Dowding falsified the signatures on admission paperwork.
Dowding “knew the consequences for falsification were severe, and she offered the employer no explanation for this action,” Johnson ruled, adding that Dowding’s actions “were willful and in deliberate disregard of the employer’s interests.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IWD-UNEMPLOYMENT-ART.jpg,,,2025-09-18 17:58:02.118885

(Getty Images)After months of informal talks, health officials from 10 Northeastern states have announced they’re forming a bloc called the Northeast Public Health Collaborative to issue vaccine guidance and coordinate public health efforts independent of the federal government. New Hampshire is not among them.
Officials from New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware announced the collaboration in a press release Thursday after months of unofficial discussions. Vermont officials said on social media Thursday it’s also involved in the collaboration. Representatives from several of the states previously met in person in Rhode Island in August.
The group said it would be collaborating on vaccine recommendations, data collection, and emergency preparedness, among other health efforts.
The effort comes amid turmoil at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services. The Trump administration has tried to fire roughly 10,000 Health and Human Services employees, including 2,400 at the CDC, though many of those firings were halted by courts. Those fired include CDC Director Susan Monarez, whose layoff inspired four top CDC officials to resign in protest. Under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the CDC is no longer recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children or pregnant women. He fired 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee and replaced many of them with skeptics. And he cut roughly $500 million from a series of mRNA vaccine research projects.
On Thursday, the Northeast collaborative made its first recommendations, which depart from Kennedy’s recent changes to CDC guidelines in that they recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children 6 months to 2 years old and pregnant women. For children ages 2 to 18, they recommend weighing a child’s risk level for COVID-19. That’s consistent with what national medical organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend.
New Hampshire is the only New England state not to join the collaborative. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services and Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office did not respond to the Bulletin’s requests for comment. However, Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner Dr. Robert Goldstein told a Bulletin reporter in Boston last week they are “actively communicating” with New Hampshire health officials on the effort. He said the collaborative is speaking with several other states that aren’t publicly involved.
“We’re having real conversations with red states, and they appreciate what we’re doing and lean on what we’re doing,” Goldstein said. “And also they can’t politically be the ones who are publicly coming out with the guidance.”
Dr. Puthiery Va, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in a statement, called the group “an incubator for solutions in public health,” adding that Mainers are “known for their resilience, neighborly support, and a collaborative approach to solving community challenges.”
The Northeast Public Health Collaborative is now one of two such health blocs. Earlier this month, four Western states — California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii — banded together to create the West Coast Health Alliance. That bloc has been more vocal in identifying their collaboration as a response to the Trump administration. 
In a joint statement, the governors of California, Oregon, and Washington said that “President Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people” and that “California, Oregon, and Washington will not allow the people of our states to be put at risk.”
On Wednesday, the West Coast Health Alliance issued its first set of recommendations. The group also recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children 6 months to 2 years old and pregnant women. And for children aged 2 to 18, they also recommend weighing a child’s risk level for COVID-19.
Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services immediately responded to the Bulletin’s request for comment about the Northeast Public Health Collaborative.
Some in the public health world are torn about this new development. Dr. Debra Houry, the former CDC chief medical officer who resigned last month in protest of Kennedy and the Trump administration’s upheaval of the CDC, said she worries about medical tourism by state.
“I get why people are doing it,” Houry, speaking to a group of health journalists in Massachusetts last week, said. “But it’s going to cause some confusion and haves and have-nots.”
Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, said she worries about “a balkanization of public health.”
Still Northeastern state health departments are touting their move.
“Whether it’s responding to a pandemic or an outbreak or preparing for a large-scale event such as the upcoming FIFA World Cup, with three host cities in the Northeast, working together helps keep our residents safe and healthy,” New Jersey Acting Health Commissioner Jeff Brown said in the release. “We look forward to continuing to do so with our colleagues in the Collaborative.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/vaxnurse-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-18 17:58:02.118885

“The Maryland Department of Health continues to explore all options to ensure broad vaccine access,” the spokesperson said in a prepared statement. “Part of this effort includes joining the bipartisan Northeast Public Health Collaborative where Maryland will partner with other states and jurisdictions to help protect the health, safety and well-being of our communities.
“This collaborative will make decisions based on scientific evidence and strive to ensure equitable access to quality health care,” the statement said.
Other states involved in the collaborative include Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. New York City is also a major player.
A handful of Northeastern states have been discussing such a collaboration since the start of the Trump administration and have held informal meetings – but it officially launched Thursday.
Health advocates worry feds’ new COVID vaccine guidelines will mean fewer vaccinations

The collaborative was created largely in response to more restrictive COVID-19 vaccine recommendations issued by federal health and safety agencies under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has questioned the effectiveness of certain vaccines, including COVID-19.
The launch of the collaborative comes as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is meeting to create new recommendations that could further limit access to COVID-19 vaccines, among other vaccinations. ACIP is scheduled to vote on the recommendations Friday.
Kennedy recently added board members who have questioned the safety of current vaccine policies. Their decisions this week could affect whether certain vaccinations will be required to be covered by insurance, which would greatly impact access to the shot.
In late August, the FDA approved an updated COVID-19 vaccine for seniors and those with health issues that suppress their immune system – a change from previous vaccine guidance that recommended the shot for everyone older than 6 months. The recommendation sparked concern that access to the COVID-19 vaccine would be cut off for some people who do not fall in those categories.
Top medical societies, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, pushed back on the federal COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. On Aug. 19, the academy recommended that “all young children ages 6-23 months get vaccinated against COVID-19, along with older children in certain risk groups.”
The Northeast Public Health Collaborative has already released its own recommendations on COVID-19 vaccinations that largely align with the AAP’s recommendation as well as with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Ensuring access to vaccinations and other public health needs has been a concern for the Moore administration since President Donald Trump took office for his second term.
Before the state joined the collaborative, Gov. Wes Moore (D) assured Marylanders that access to vaccinations would be protected in the state for the time being. In May, he signed legislation that required insurers to cover vaccinations that had been recommended by ACIP as of December 2024, avoiding any change to coverage based on upcoming ACIP recommendation. That law took effect June 1.
“This protects against the withdrawal of vaccine coverage for a range of illnesses, not just COVID-19,” according to a recent statement from the governor’s office.

How many millions would have been saved had the high-priority flood mitigation measures been implemented?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Samn Stockwell: It’s time Barre invests in flood mitigation.","This commentary is by Samn Stockwell, of Barre. Stockwell is a poet, educator and former Barre City councilor.


In May 2011, Barre was the casualty of a flood that left 3 feet of mud caked on buildings and in the streets. The Times-Argus building on North Main was swamped. The Harrington Street Bridge collapsed. What was once Allen Lumber became filled with muddy water. News reports from 2023 closely echo flood reports from 2011.
The floods of 2011 were part of a long history of floods in Barre City. In Barre, as in much of Vermont, flooding is a frequent disaster and an existential threat. The same neighborhoods have experienced flooding for decades, a threat that will intensify as the climate changes.
Cities are required to plan for potential disasters — such as flooding — in hazard mitigation plans. Barre developed a new hazard mitigation plan in January 2012 after the two floods in 2011. 
Although the plan acknowledges the high probability and damaging impact of flooding, little of what the city listed as a high priority got done in the intervening years. City Place was built. Enterprise Alley and Merchant’s Way parking lots were developed. $2.5 million was spent on the two parking lots, as opposed to approximately $500,000 spent on Gunner’s Brook flood mitigation.
Developing river buffers along the Stevens Branch did not happen, despite the damage to the neighborhoods along it and recommendations from the state Agency of Natural Resources. The same neighborhoods flooded in 2023. Listed as a medium priority in the plan was installing trash racks in the Gunner Brook section near Harrington, which was completed in 2016.
In the hazard mitigation plan of 2012, six floods were listed from 2000 to 2011. (Floods also occurred in the 1990s). Previous plans note the damage from floods and the cost to the city. The factual data showed an unmistakable trend of floods increasing in frequency. 
How many millions would have been saved had the high-priority flood mitigation measures were implemented? The costs of the 2023 and 2024 floods were estimated at $4.6 million, but that doesn’t begin to measure the social/emotional damage, and the slow trickle of people moving out. That flood mitigation hasn’t happened means residents continue having their homes and yards destroyed, along with their trust in city management.
Barre is poised to apply for millions in grant funding through the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program, and it would be logical if the request were primarily for flood mitigation, rebuilding and infrastructure replacement. 
The mayor is suggesting over $8 million for new infrastructure in a new development in a city that cannot afford to replace its existing infrastructure. Everyone who has watched their storm drains spit back runoff into their street knows the system is inadequate and contributes to flooding — and everyone who lives along the Stevens Branch knows what flooding has meant for their finances and the chances of selling their home. 
The city as a whole may not realize what the cost has been and what the cost will be.

(Screenshot of judiciary.senate.gov stream)The Senate Judiciary Committee heard from four nominees for North Carolina’s federal courts on Wednesday as it considers whether to advance them to the full Senate.
The nominees, announced by President Donald J. Trump in August, received the backing of North Carolina Republican U.S. Senators Ted Budd and Thom Tillis, the latter of whom serves on the Judiciary Committee. Matthew Orso and Susan Courtwright Rodriguez are under consideration to serve on the Western District Court and David Bragdon and Lindsey Freeman are nominated for the Middle District Court.

“I’m grateful to President Trump for nominating these exceptionally qualified individuals to serve as U.S. district judges for the great state of North Carolina,” said Budd, who introduced the nominees. “I have full confidence in each of these nominees and trust that they will faithfully apply the words of our Constitution and the letter of the law without resorting to the wrongful practice of judicial activism.”
Tillis lauded the four for their “impeccable credentials” and said he looks forward to their appointment to the federal bench. All have experience in the federal courts, either as clerks or through litigation.
“All four of these nominees are eminently qualified and will make the state and our country proud,” Tillis said. “There are currently only 10 active federal judges in North Carolina, not counting those on senior status, so filling these four vacancies is very important for our state.”
He noted that Orso — who he called “one of the best lawyers in North Carolina” — is nominated for the seat of the judge he clerked for, Judge Robert J. Conrad. Rodriguez, likewise, was nominated to succeed Judge Frank Whitney, whom she clerked for. Both Conrad and Whitney attended Wednesday’s hearing.
Though most of the questioning on Wednesday centered on Seventh Circuit nominee Rebecca Taibleson and Office of National Drug Control Policy director nominee Sara Carter, the prospective North Carolina judges also faced scrutiny from the committee — particularly from Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a frequent needler of conservative and liberal nominees alike.
Kennedy quizzed the nominees on matters including legal protections for religious practice in the workplace, supplemental jurisdiction, and the Constitutional amendment process.
David Bragdon, nominated for a judgeship in the Middle District of North Carolina, expressed uncertainty about matters of civil law. (Screenshot of judiciary.senate.gov stream)
“Supplemental jurisdiction — I am having trouble remembering that term because it does not come up in criminal practice very much,” Bragdon said.
“It’s going to come up in federal district court,” Kennedy said. “Every other Thursday.”
“I will certainly carefully research any issue that were to come before me if I’m confirmed,” Bragdon replied.
Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) asked Orso whether he would follow the Supreme Court’s precedent in Griswold v. Connecticut, a 1965 case protecting the use of contraceptives.
“I would follow all Supreme Court precedent if fortunate enough to be confirmed as a district court judge,” he said.
Hirono also asked Rodriguez to share her feelings after presiding over naturalization ceremonies as a magistrate judge. She answered that those are “very near and dear to my heart,” in part because her husband is the child of Cuban immigrants who became naturalized.
Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said while he does not think Kennedy was “necessarily happy about the answers,” with Bragdon and Freeman expressing uncertainty over concepts in civil law, he does not expect any difficulty in any of the four being confirmed.
“I think they know their way around the courtroom, I was persuaded of that, because I think all of them had some federal court experience, and some of them quite substantial federal court experience,” Tobias said. “I do think what’s likely is there won’t be any no votes from Republicans.”
Though Tillis did not question the district nominees during the hearing, he said he and Budd subjected the four to “hours of discussion” during the vetting process.
He also extended his gratitude to his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for preserving the “blue slip” process for judicial nominees, giving senators veto power over district court judges in their home state. Trump has placed pressure on Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chair of the Judiciary Committee, to do away with the practice, which has thwarted Republican and Democratic presidents alike from confirming some of their preferred nominees.
“Chuck Grassley should allow strong Republican candidates to ascend to these very vital and powerful roles, and tell the Democrats, as they often tell us, to go to HELL!” Trump posted on Truth Social in August.
Tillis noted on Wednesday that without the blue slip, Trump would not have had the opportunity to fill two of the four North Carolina vacancies.
“It’s an institution that’s over 100 years old and it’s every bit as relevant today as it was 100 years ago,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Senate-NC-Judges-Hearing-e1758222170242-1024x767.png,,,2025-09-18 17:58:02.118885
,DC,2025-09-18 21:26:44+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Decline in K-12 national reading, math, science scores probed by US Senate panel",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/decline-k-12-national-reading-math-science-scores-probed-us-senate-panel,,"WASHINGTON — Just days after federal data revealed average reading, math and science scores dropped among certain grades since before the coronavirus pandemic, a U.S. Senate panel on Thursday picked apart the root causes and methods for students’ academic improvement. The hearing in the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions centered on the “state of K-12 education” — which GOP members on the committee described as “troubling” — in light of recent data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP.NAEP, regarded as the gold standard for tracking students’ academic performance, showed that average science scores for eighth-graders decreased by 4 points since before the pandemic, in 2019. Average math and reading scores for 12th-graders also fell 3 points between 2019 and 2024. The assessments were administered between January and March of 2024. Results also showed that just one-third of 12th-graders are considered academically prepared for college in math — a drop from 37% in 2019. The committee’s chair, Sen. Bill Cassidy, said “it should concern us that children’s reading, math and science scores have yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels.” The Louisiana Republican added that “success in education is not determined by how much we spend, but by who makes the decision and how wisely resources are directed,” and “when states and local communities are empowered to tailor solutions to meet the unique needs of students, innovation follows.” On the other hand, Sen. Bernie Sanders, ranking member of the panel, said that “while we focus on education — as important as that is — we also have to focus on the conditions under which our children are living.” The Vermont independent noted that “when you’re looking at the real world out there, we’re looking at millions of families that are struggling to put food on the table, to pay the rent, kids who are growing up in dysfunctional families.” He said that while he’s glad the committee is focusing on these issues, “we have got to understand education is important — that means prioritize our children, prioritize our educators.” Role of technology in educationMartin West, vice chair of the National Assessment Governing Board, which oversees and establishes policy for NAEP, said that while the assessments generally measure what’s happening to student achievement rather than the causes, “the patterns it documents can guide our search for explanations and solutions.” He said the rise in smartphones and social media platforms that target youth is, in his view, one area to investigate. “We lack direct evidence of a causal link between smartphones and learning, but I’m convinced that this technology is a key driver of youth mental health challenges, a distraction from learning, both inside and outside of schools, and a deterrent to reading when NAEP surveys reveal that many fewer students read on their own for fun,” he said. Indiana’s approach Katie Jenner, Indiana’s secretary of Education and the state’s commissioner for higher education, pointed to some of the initiatives in her state to improve students’ academic performance.“Over the past three years, Indiana rebuilt early literacy based on the science of reading,” she said. “Backed by a major public-private partnership with Lilly Endowment, we have trained thousands of teachers, expanded coaching, and districts are adopting evidence-based materials.”Jenner pointed to the Hoosier State seeing a historic jump in reading scores for third-graders this year, with a rise of nearly 5 percentage points from the previous year.  The state is also working on helping secondary students who continue to struggle with reading, including “deploying an outcomes-based contracting pilot, specifically for middle school reading in areas like tutoring and targeted interventions.” Jenner said Indiana is also “rethinking high school” and “overhauled our diplomas, added outcomes-based incentives to our school funding formulas and ensured the connection to school accountability.” ‘State of education in shambles’Meanwhile, some Democrats on the panel blasted President Donald Trump’s dramatic overhaul of the federal role in education as he seeks to dismantle the Education Department. Though the assessments were conducted long before the start of Trump’s second White House administration, Democrats pointed to the changes the department has undergone since he took office again and their impact on students. “I’m really glad that we are holding this hearing on the state of education because I am seeing the state of education in shambles under this Department of Education, where the president vowed to dismantle the Department of Education, he set immediately to work to tear apart programs that support our students and schools — no regard to the law or the consequences or even what’s best for our students,” said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. “So, I see the state of education as delayed and frozen, canceling funding, robbing our schools of support for our teachers and our supports and services kids need to succeed,” she said. Murray expressed concerns that “instead of working with us to fix the education system, Trump and the secretary of Education (Linda McMahon) are making it a lot worse.”",,,,2025-09-18 17:58:02.118885

On Thursday, Executive Director Don Stevens said he received a pledge “out of the blue” of up to $43,600 to guarantee the pantry would make it through the winter.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
The Holland Food Shelf is set to remain open for at least six more months after an anonymous donor came forward with funding, according to Don Stevens, executive director of the nonprofit that runs the pantry.  
The pantry had been poised to close at the end of the month due to the elimination of the federal SNAP-Ed program, as well as rising overhead costs. But Stevens said Thursday that he had received a pledge “out of the blue” of up to $43,600 to guarantee the pantry would make it through the winter.
The organization serves residents in and around Holland at Vermont’s border with Canada, and helps cover an area of the state that is often difficult to reach for other food assistance providers. The gift will spare the local community a poorly timed loss of resources and guarantee a source of free food for those in need during the tough winter months, Stevens said. 
Stevens’ team had stopped ordering food in anticipation of shutting down the pantry, but has now “put in an emergency order” with the Vermont Foodbank for the flow of food to resume. The two food pantry staff who had been facing layoffs will keep their positions too, at least until March.
“We are glad to hear that Holland (Food Shelf) will be able to remain open to serve their community,” Carrie Stahler, Vermont Foodbank’s government and public affairs manager, said Thursday. When the pantry was set to close, Stahler had emphasized the importance of local partner organizations in the state’s food assistance network.
Stevens said the donor is a Vermont resident, but not a Holland local. 
“He doesn’t want attention,” Stevens said. “He didn’t want to see people go hungry.”

Stevens, who directs the nonprofit Abenaki Helping Abenaki and is chief of the Nulhegan band of the Coosuk Abenaki Nation, said his organization is facing significant shortfalls. He’s hoping this donation will “spark other people” to support the food pantry through next spring and beyond.
“Otherwise, we’ll be back where we started,” he said.
Marci Diamond, a local resident and pantry volunteer who expressed concern about the planned closure, was cautiously optimistic on Thursday.
“At least our area will have a food shelf for a little longer,” she said. “It underscores the importance of community members stepping up to get involved with mutual aid.”
Diamond said the donation “is of course good news … but then what happens to the rural, isolated veterans, elders, farmers and children, at the end of winter?”
Stevens added that his organization is not unique in its struggles. 
“There’s still so much need out there, with other food shelves potentially closing and other food programs being cut,” he said.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A day after House Republicans complained that Rhode Island’s affordable housing financing agency spends more money building bureaucracy instead of housing, the agency’s top two leaders came to the State House Thursday ready to prove them wrong.
And Carol Ventura, the executive director for RIHousing, and Deputy Director James Comer had plenty of numbers to back them up.
In the first seven months of 2025, RIHousing financed over 2,300 units with federal recovery funds, breaking ground on 214 new homes and finishing 148 more across Rhode Island. The agency fully committed $232 million in federal pandemic aid to housing production or preservation and down payment assistance. Of that total, $147.5 million had been spent as of July 31.
“As you can see, we have communities from Westerly to Woonsocket, from Little Compton to Burrillville, that have dispensed this money and are actively building newer affordable housing,” Comer told a House commission studying housing affordability.
The 20-member Special Legislative Commission on Housing Affordability is looking at how to tackle the state’s shortage of homes and what policy recommendations to make.
Among the panel’s members is House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, a Foster Republican who on Wednesday called for an audit of RIHousing, which he characterized as “bloated” and inefficient. House Republicans released a report that found RIHousing had the second highest combined administrative and personnel costs in the region at $46.4 million. 
House GOP number crunching tries to find fault with RIHousing administrative costs

When scaled to 10,000 residents, it was about $417,400 — nearly $60,000 higher than Vermont. When compared to MassHousing, the report found a disparity of over $300,000 per 10,000 residents.
But Chippendale was one of five commissioners who skipped Thursday’s meeting. He had told Rhode Island Current on Wednesday that he would miss the meeting because he would be babysitting his 2-month-old grandson. Chippendale continued to criticize in a post on X Thursday morning.
“I made observations of RIHousing based on the data,” Chippendale wrote.
He also criticized RIHousing’s board of commissioners for canceling a meeting that was  scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Thursday where officials were scheduled to consider updating salaries for senior management.
The meeting was canceled due to a lack of quorum, RIHousing spokesperson Christine Hunsinger confirmed in an email.
Housing Secretary Deborah Goddard, who chairs the RIHousing board, acknowledged the poor timing of the cancellation, but said it’s hardly the norm.
“This is the first meeting they’ve canceled in years,” she said in an interview after the commission’s meeting. “It’s really not a problem.”
None of the 15 commissioners present Thursday mentioned the House GOP’s complaints during their 90-minute meeting. Instead, Commission Chair June Speakman, a Warren Democrat, asked what role the quasi-public agency should play in Rhode Island’s housing landscape now that the state has a dedicated Executive Office of Housing under a reorganization that took effect July 1. 
Before then, the Rhode Island Department of Housing oversaw housing production and the state’s homelessness response. 
“We are very much about the development process and the financing of development,” Ventura responded.
She detailed how the agency assists with mortgages for first-time homebuyers, acts as a public housing authority for municipalities that don’t have them, and obtains housing vouchers. 
Policy decisions come from the Executive Office of Housing, which Goddard said often works hand in hand with RIHousing since it is still the larger, more established agency that still overshadows the young state office.
“We’re small, we have a staffing budget for 38 people,” she said. 
RIHousing, meanwhile, has roughly 237 employees. With that kind of staffing, Goddard said it makes little sense for the state to try to duplicate a financing system that’s already in place.
“So there’s got to be a symbiotic relationship throughout all of this,” Goddard said.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Prosecutors on Thursday approved a plan to request $500,000 from the Legislature next session to create a new team to provide assistance with death penalty cases.
The team would be housed within the District Attorneys Council and involve eight to 12 capital homicide attorneys. It would meet three to four times a year to provide case assessments, said Ryan Stephenson, District Attorneys Council assistant executive coordinator.
The team would help district attorneys draft motions and assist with statements and experts, and help with legal research.
The goal would be to “improve the quality and consistency of death penalty casework statewide,” according to a document provided by the agency.
“I think one of the nice things about this request is that it’s a really defendable one at the Capitol, regardless of whether you’re talking to people who are for the death penalty or against it,” Stephenson said.
In 2017, the Oklahoma Death Penalty Review Commission issued a 300-page report with 46 recommendations.
The Commission recommended additional training on issues such as the limitations of eyewitness identification, jailhouse informants and common causes of wrongful convictions.
“This training alone, I think, just checks seven of those boxes,” Stephenson said. “So, even those that are traditionally against the death penalty at the Capitol, theoretically, should be on board with this.”
The unit would not be able to control how prosecutors handle cases, but would serve as a resource for them, he said.
The funding would also help cover the cost of a dedicated analyst who would study and report on major crime and capital case data to help prosecutors make informed policy and litigation decisions.
“This team is only going to help us ensure that we are doing the best work, not only for the people of Oklahoma, but specifically the victims involved in these cases,” said District Attorneys Council Chairman Kyle Cabelka, who serves as the top prosecutor for Comanche and Cotton counties.
Stephenson said he would recommend moving forward with creating the unit regardless of whether lawmakers provided funding.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a member of the DAC, had no comment on the proposal.
Drummond was instrumental in getting a third trial for former death row inmate Richard Glossip, who awaits retrial for his involvement in the 1997 slaying of Oklahoma City motel owner Barry Van Treese. 
Drummond was highly critical of how prosecutors handled the case.

Montpelier is asking city residents and businesses to be mindful of their taps and limit water usage as drought conditions take a toll on local water resources. 
“Berlin Pond, which serves as our community’s primary source of drinking water, is feeling the effects of this extended dry period,” the city’s public works department said in a notice on Thursday afternoon.
That morning, water levels in the pond dropped just below the threshold to warrant conservation efforts, according to Kurt Motyka, director of Montpelier’s public works department.

“It’s been on our radar, certainly for the last few months. We’ve been watching it closely,” Motyka said. 
The effects on the capital city are a result of drought conditions playing out across the state. On Thursday, Montpelier — along with about 76% of Vermont — was in a severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
Just under 2% of the state, in a stretch along the New Hampshire border, is in an extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The rest of the state — mostly in southern and northwestern parts — are in a moderate drought. 
Officials are encouraging residents to save water in their homes by taking shorter showers, not watering their lawns, fixing leaky faucets and only running dishwashers or washing machines with full loads. The city is also urging businesses to check for leaks in their facilities, educate their employees and try to reduce water use when possible. 
Burlington and Colchester issued similar notices in early August due to low water supply before they later lifted the alerts. 
Motyka said water levels in Berlin Pond would have to dip another 6 inches lower to prompt mandatory water conservation. Because of the pond’s large size, he said he’s optimistic the city won’t need to take that measure.
So far, the pond’s lower water levels are visible to the plain eye and more dramatically obvious downstream, Matyka said.

Free.,Big batch of Trump nominees moves through US Senate after Republicans change rules,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/big-batch-trump-nominees-moves-through-us-senate-after-republicans-change-rules,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted Thursday to approve dozens of nominees, acting on a rule change GOP leadership made last week that allows the chamber to confirm some of the president’s appointees in large batches instead of one at a time. The 51-47 vote followed weeks of debate over whether senators could work out a deal on groups of nominees, with Democrats warning along the way that any changes to Senate procedures that benefit the Trump administration now will likely aid a future Democratic president. “What Republicans have done is chip away at the Senate even more to give Donald Trump more power and to rubber-stamp whomever he wants, whenever he wants them, no questions asked,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said last week after Republicans initiated the rule change.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said during a floor speech Thursday a few hours before the vote that changing the rules was necessary after Democrats “fully broke the confirmation process.”Thune rebutted Democrats' assessment that Trump has sent the Senate “historically bad” nominees, saying that many of his picks are getting Democratic votes. “Every single one of these 48 nominees was voted out of committee with bipartisan support. Every single one. A significant number of them were supported by a majority of Democrats on their respective committees,” Thune said.  “Under any other president these would be exactly the type of nominees we would confirm in a batch by unanimous consent or voice vote,” Thune added. “Democrats' obstruction is not about the quality of the nominees. Let’s just put that to rest, pure and simple. It’s about Democrats' utter inability to accept the fact the American people elected Donald Trump.” The eight-page resolution, likely the first of many, lists 48 nominees, including Theodore J. Garrish, of Maryland, to be an assistant secretary of Energy (Nuclear Energy); Jessica Kramer, of Wisconsin, to be an assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Sean McMaster, of Virginia, to be administrator of the Federal Highway Administration; Justin Overbaugh, of Florida, to be a deputy under secretary of Defense; Scott Pappano, of Pennsylvania, to be principal deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration; Peter Thomson, of Louisiana, to be inspector general at the Central Intelligence Agency; and Andrea Travnicek, of North Dakota, to be an assistant secretary of the Interior.The vote followed weeks of frustration from Trump and numerous GOP senators, who are exasperated by Democrats slowing down the confirmation process for lower-ranking nominees. The new way of handling nominations “en bloc” doesn’t apply to Supreme Court or higher-ranking judicial nominees, or Cabinet-level picks.",,,,2025-09-18 17:58:02.118885

The arrest of the mother and daughter in Whitefish led to protests and questions about racial profiling. (Provided by Cortnie Brooks)A Flathead Valley mother and daughter from Honduras who were arrested by U.S. Border Patrol last weekend arrived Wednesday at a facility in Texas, the Daily Montanan confirmed.
Luisa Torres and her daughter, Fergie Diaz, 17, were arrested Sunday after a call from the Montana Highway Patrol, leading to a 36-hour demonstration and additional arrests, according to a witness and authorities.
The mother and daughter were detained after arriving at the scene of a car crash, a friend told the Daily Montanan.
Their arrests come just weeks before a controversial new law passed during the 2025 legislative session takes effect Oct. 1 and could further complicate the role of local and state authorities in federal immigration actions, an attorney for the ACLU of Montana said.
Just before 9 p.m. on Sunday, Cortnie Brooks said she received a phone call from Torres, her English student since February 2024.
“Cortnie, ayúdame,” Torres said, and sent Brooks a dropped pin of a location along a stretch of highway three miles away in Evergreen. “Tienes que venir para acá.”
Translated to English: “Cortnie, help me. You need to come here.”
Torres and Diaz had stopped to help with a car accident they were not involved in, Brooks said, adding she could hear law enforcement in the background of their call.
“I knew that they were being detained,” Brooks said.
Brooks said she was placed on speaker and spoke with a Border Patrol officer. “When I asked why they were being detained, he asked if I was a lawyer. I said no, and he said, ‘Then we can no longer speak.’”
When Brooks arrived at the pinned location, she spoke with a Montana Highway Patrol officer, who told her neither Torres nor Diaz were involved in the accident, Brooks said. She said he told her they were arrested due to “coming on scene after the fact,” the same reason given to Brooks by the Whitefish Border Patrol officer who was also present.
Brooks said she told both officers being “on the scene” was not a valid reason to be detained. She said when she asked if Torres and Diaz would have access to a lawyer, the Border Patrol officer responded with, “We’ll see.”
U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment from the Daily Montanan.
However in a statement to MTN, Customs and Border Protection said it made five arrests Sunday of people “found to have no legal status in the United States.”
CBP said it does not disclose the identities of those it detains “due to privacy.”
A spokesperson for Montana Highway Patrol initially denied to the Daily Montanan involvement in the women’s arrests but later confirmed the agency had contacted Border Patrol to “help translate. And Border Patrol took over the investigation. MHP did not make any arrests related to this incident. Please contact the Whitefish Border Patrol station for more information.”
Sunday night’s arrests follow a string of similar incidents across the state, as federal immigration officers have increased activity in Montana communities, at times embroiling local law enforcement in controversy and legal battles.
Flathead County, Gallatin County and Montana Highway Patrol signed 287(g) agreements, allowing the agencies to carry out certain immigration enforcement duties under ICE’s supervision and direction.
“What local law enforcement is supposed to do is to protect communities and individuals from crime,” said Alex Rate, deputy director at ACLU of Montana. “Most police officers, highway patrol, sign on to conduct local law enforcement actions, not to become immigration authorities. The expansion of the federal immigration apparatus is alarming, and we should all be very concerned.”
Starting Oct. 1, the new law authorizes law enforcement officers to check a person’s immigration status at a lawful stop if the officer has “reasonable suspicion,” and it requires them to report unlawful immigration status to federal authorities.
“The law is very problematic because it essentially invites racial profiling,” Rate said. “It doesn’t require local law enforcement to check immigration status, but if they have reasonable suspicion that an individual may be undocumented they can check, and if they are [undocumented], then law enforcement are required to report them to federal immigration authorities.”
The subjective nature of the law is the problematic part, Rate said.
“What is reasonable suspicion to believe that somebody may be undocumented? It is against the law to use things like accent or the color of somebody’s skin. That is, by definition, racial profiling,” said Rate. “So it’s a problematic law on many levels, and certainly opens up local government, local law enforcement to lawsuits related to unlawful racial profiling.”
Word of the women’s arrests made its way through the Whitefish community, and late Sunday, community members gathered at the Border Patrol station.
Student Colton Little,19, said he arrived at the protest around 6:30 p.m. Monday and stayed until Tuesday morning.

“I think going after anyone who is just trying to live their life, raise their kids, work a job, be part of the community, it’s never an OK thing to do,” Little said. “It’s especially wrong that they’re going after a mother and her 17-year-old daughter. It’s a child. A child that’s two years younger than me.”
The protest lasted more than 36 hours until early Tuesday, with contentious interactions with Border Patrol. At one point, a video shows a Border Patrol vehicle pushing into Leanette Galaz, a local organizer with Flathead Democracy, as she walks backwards into the street.
“I didn’t plan to step in front of that truck the way I did,” Galaz told the Daily Montanan. “But it was a good test to see where they were at in terms of how they respect our bodies, our lives and our safety. And it showed us very quickly that they don’t. So that informed our decisions for the rest of the night in a way that made things work much better and safer.”
Galaz said the group had called the Whitefish Police Department to be on site.
A Border Patrol vehicle arrived Tuesday morning at the entrance of the Whitefish Border Patrol station, one that Galaz said the protesters believed carried Torres and Diaz.

They linked arms in front of the vehicle, and Galaz said a Whitefish police officer stepped between them and the Border Patrol truck. He informed them they’d be arrested if they didn’t move. When they refused, three people were arrested around 8:30 a.m. and charged with disturbing the peace, criminal trespassing, and obstruction. They were released on bail after a community fundraiser.
In a statement, the Whitefish Police Department said it directed protesters to not block vehicles from leaving the U.S. Border Patrol facility. They said they had received earlier complaints about noise and protesters blocking traffic along Nelson Lane and Highway 93 West before the arrests.
Brooks said she believes the arrests of the mother and daughter who work in housing construction was not in good faith.
“They came here to build communities for people living in the U.S.,” said Brooks, through tears. “They’re not making a lot of money, and whatever they make they send home to feed their kids and families. And for us to consider that criminal is abhorrent.”
The family detention center in Dilley, Texas, where they are being held has a history of documented human rights violations.
Galaz relayed a message directly to Torres and Diaz.
“Ustedes están en mi corazón,” she said. “Estoy contigo. Lo siento. Lo siento que no pudimos hacer más para ayudarte.”

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Buleltin)In the storybook version of American politics, a fresh idea to benefit the common good is what gets you elected as a public servant. The reality of American politics is that it’s much easier to win a seat, and stay there, by scaring people and exploiting whatever resentments they might harbor. All the while, the principal right-left domestic confrontation never changes, and to that point here’s how William Jennings Bryan described it well over a century ago.
“There are two ideas of government. There are those who believe that, if you will only legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, their prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea, however, has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous, their prosperity will find its way up through every class which rests upon them.”
In the many decades since the New Deal, which sought to marry policy with that “Democratic idea,” the rollback toward a new Gilded Age has been underway. If FDR was the model for the second idea then Donald Trump is the poster child for first, and so when viewed as part of America’s long retreat from the upward flow of prosperity our current president’s reign feels inevitable. The signature legislation of his first term was the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed right off the bat in 2017, and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, also prioritized from the outset, will be the signature legislation of his second. Both represent successful efforts to “legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous,” and the gamble taken by his voters, once again, is that the prosperity will “leak through.” They know better than I whether it has or hasn’t, and it’s entirely up to them how long they’re willing to wait around and hope.
The United States is fully a Republican nation now, and so the task for voters is to decide for themselves whether the president’s policies mark, on their own merit, an improvement in their circumstances and that of their communities. While the people await the promised return on their investment in wealth concentration, it’s important to consider how the nation is paying for the tax cuts. Is the burden shifted to states, such as new financial responsibilities for social programs, public education, and even disaster response, acceptable on principle or only insofar as it is eventually (hopefully?) alleviated by way of the “leak through”?
The same judgment must be made in New Hampshire, a fully Republican state that also marries its policies to Bryan’s first idea of government. As in Washington, the shape that takes is tax cuts and repeals that must be made up elsewhere until the trickle arrives, and as a result much of the burden shifts down from the state to the communities and individual families. That’s most visible in the education funding debate, where town voters are tasked with paying for their schools through property taxes that are already unbearably high. The Republicans’ offered solution for that primary burden of high property taxes takes a few different direct policy forms: universal vouchers, a push for open enrollment, and a movement toward the consolidation of school administrative units. Their indirect solution is to force communities to cut staff and programs, often in conflict with their own wishes for the kids in their town.
While none of those policy initiatives have alleviated the property-tax burden, or promise to any time soon, the hope seems to be that the free-market competition we’re barreling toward will someday lead to less expensive education and improved outcomes. There is no clear description of what that would look like, even from its most optimistic proponents, but from the Republican perspective it doesn’t really matter. What does matter is alignment with that first idea of government — and the Republican education model very much accomplishes that. From there, the vision seems to be, “Let the chips fall where they may.”
The thing is, I have no problem with the confrontation described by Bryan. None at all. That is America’s natural tension — prosperity should flow up or it should flow down. Go all in on one side, go all in on the other, or look for a Goldilocks spot somewhere in the middle, whatever floats your boat. It all gets settled at the polls. And while we all must live with the election results, the beauty of this experiment is that, win or lose, the fight for something better is perpetually waged.
The problem I do have, however, is that there is a coordinated effort underway to convince the people of New Hampshire and the nation that scratching their resentment itches — racial, political, or otherwise – is the same thing as improving their lives. What people are being sold is a mental position, or a story they can tell themselves about what is good or bad in their world while they wait for their actual circumstances to improve. To see a ban on sanctuary cities, or the removal of a library book from a shelf, or retribution against perceived political enemies as progress is to place your faith in an illusion. And I don’t mean illusion as in imaginary but illusion as in wrongly perceived.
Rejoicing in payback and the suffering of others is an awfully cheap substitute for broader prosperity, and broader prosperity is the one thing politicians of all stripes claim to want even as they disagree on the path.
If that prosperity was indeed flowing down broadly in this Republican state in this Republican nation, that’s all that would be needed for the party to hold and expand its power. Highlight the real and honest gains in overall well-being and living conditions for the majority, the kind of gains people feel in their pockets, and that’s a winner in November. No need for gerrymandering, or the mining of resentment, or the rollback of voting rights, or the silencing of dissent. Let prosperity speak for itself.
If Republicans can’t or won’t do that, their voters should probably be asking why. But I suspect that on some level they already know the answer.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/votinghooksett-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 17:58:02.118885

(Photo by Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images)The federal government will begin turning some of its worst radioactive waste at the Hanford nuclear reservation into glass by an Oct. 15 legal deadline. 
Last week, ambiguous signals out of the U.S. Secretary of Energy’s office about whether glassification would begin on time at the site in south-central Washington had spooked state leaders.
Late Wednesday, the office of Energy Secretary Chris Wright told congressional members that glassification would start on schedule. 
Today, the Energy Department’s Richland office confirmed that information, adding that a specific start-up date has not been nailed down yet for between now and Oct 15.
Democratic U.S. Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, plus Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, have led the congressional birddogging of this project. 
Newhouse said in a statement that “despite unsubstantiated rumors and speculation,” the “signed approval from DOE is confirmation of what Secretary Wright told me multiple times over the past 10 days, that there will be no delays to the start of the Waste Treatment Plant.”
Murray said by email that, “after unacceptable delays, it’s good that DOE has finally heeded my call to sign the paperwork necessary to move forward with the final step of hot commissioning before treatment of radioactive waste can begin on Oct. 15.” 
Cantwell echoed Murray’s remarks.
Gov. Bob Ferguson in a written statement that the state would “hold the Trump Administration accountable to the Oct. 15 deadline.”
“The united voices of workers, businesses and elected leaders are making a difference,” he said.
Last week, Politico E&E reported that Wright replaced Roger Jarrell with Tim Walsh as principal deputy assistant secretary of DOE’s Office of Environmental Management, as part of a move to take Hanford’s cleanup in a different direction. 
When Murray telephoned Wright about this last week, he told her that the Department of Energy is planning to curb hot commissioning at the glassification plant, citing an undefined safety consideration.
That sparked massive concerns among Ferguson and Washington’s congressional delegation that the glassification plans were in jeopardy.
The U.S. government set up Hanford in 1943 to create plutonium for the nation’s atomic bombs. That work created billions of gallons of chemical and radioactive wastes, the worst 56 million gallons of which were pumped into 177 underground tanks. 
About a third of those tanks leak. At least a million gallons of radioactive liquid have leaked into the ground, seeping into the aquifer 200 feet below and then into the Columbia River, roughly seven miles away.
Hanford began construction of a plant to begin treating the waste in 2002. It was originally legally scheduled to go online in 2009 — 16 years ago. 
This first plant is supposed to take care of 40-50% of the tanks’ low-activity wastes. The master plan has been to build two low-activity glassification plants plus a third to handle 5 million to 6 million gallons of high-level radioactive wastes. 
The entire project’s original budget in 2002 was $4 billion, which has grown to roughly $30 billion today. The first low-activity waste plant cost slightly more than $9 billion. 
Currently, Hanford’s legal target calls for glassifying all tank wastes by 2052. DOE has internally moved those targets back to 2069, according to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office. 
Last year, the feds and state agreed to look at possibly encasing some low-activity wastes in grout — a cement-like substance.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/hanford-nuclear-site-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-18 16:57:11.614114

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)The main Democratic candidate for governor — former Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly — called Thursday for changes to Florida’s universal school voucher program, which helps pay to send students to private school.
Jolly, however, did not call for the elimination of the program notwithstanding criticism of it by many Democrats. Instead, he said, it is “underserving Florida’s families” despite its steady expansion during GOP control of Florida. The state opened the program to all interested families in 2023, regardless of their financial status.
“I’m a Democrat who’s not going to stand up and tell you we’re going to do away with choice,” said Jolly. “Choice is here. Choice is here to stay. However, Florida families are being left behind by the current choice program.”
In remarks to the Capital Tiger Bay Club, Jolly said private schools that accept vouchers and charter schools should be required to offer the same standards and services as public schools and abide by similar rules. He also suggested that private schools that accept vouchers should not be allowed to raise tuition rates above the voucher amount or turn away students with disabilities.
Jolly said he stood ready to work with Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview, to help make changes to the school choice program (as well as to how the state regulates utilities.) Gaetz, a former Senate president, serves on key education committees.
“One of the things I want to say in this room, just because I know it’ll get back to him, I want to work with Sen. Don Gaetz on utility reform because I think he’s fighting for consumers and he got shut down by Republicans in leadership. I would love to be a Democratic governor working with a Republican on utility reform. I would welcome it in the education space as well.”

“We feel trapped”
Jolly after his remarks told reporters that he has two children enrolled in a faith-based private school, one in pre-kindergarten and the other in kindergarten. He uses the state vouchers to help offset costs for both of his children.
“We feel trapped in today’s choice environment. We feel trapped,” he said. “And I don’t want to say this to make it sound like we’re a martyr. When I say we may be one cycle too early to where Florida families really awaken to this fact — that the voucher and charter schools are underserving Florida’s families — that’s a lived experience.”
Jolly said he believes Democrats “have miscalculated in the past” by simply “attacking” school choice and that’s not his tactic.
“Hopefully, what you heard from my language is, I’m trying to improve the choice program. I’m trying to improve the services of all schools to Florida’s families. So that means improving the resources for public education and it means making sure if there’s a voucher or charter school that they have to meet the same standards and services because, in that environment, our family is not in that pinch anymore. This is going to be the education issue of the next 10 years in the state of Florida if we don’t fix it.”
Jolly says he pays supplemental tuition on top of the vouchers he receives.  The local elementary school is not the right environment for his family, he said. There’s a Pinellas County magnet school about 20 minutes south of his neighborhood that he acknowledges “would probably be a pretty good fit,” and will most likely be where his children transition in the coming years. 
But as they age, the public high school they would most likely consider is 20 minutes to the north of his neighborhood.
“So a 40-minute difference in friend groups life and community,” Jolly said. 
Florida hasn’t had a Democrat in the Governor’s Office since Buddy MacKay, who finished out the last days of Lawton Chiles’ second term after Chiles died in office. And despite Republicans having more than a 1.35 million-registered voter advantage over Democrats, Jolly maintains that a unifying message can bring him a victory in November 2026.
Jolly to Demings: Don’t divide the party
While Jolly is the only Democrat officially in the Democratic primary, Orlando County Democratic Mayor Jerry Demings also may be pondering a run. 
Jolly did say he worries that if Demings jumps into the contest, it could divide the party. Demings is married to Val Demings, a former member of Congress who in 2022 tried unsuccessfully to unseat Republican Sen. U.S. Marco Rubio.
Meanwhile, the Republican gubernatorial primary could prove a busy one. Former House Speaker Paul Renner has announced his candidacy, as has U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, the Republican who represents Florida’s 19th Congressional District. Donalds has been endorsed by President Donald Trump. 
Lt. Gov. Jay Collins also has shown an interest, as has First Lady Casey DeSantis.
“Look, Republicans are about to have a vicious primary on their side of the aisle. Let them have the circus and let us unify. I accept responsibility for unifying the race. I hope to build a strong enough coalition that Jerry agrees to be a part of.”

The workers are suing Remington Seeds, which operates a seed-corn processing facility in DeWitt, and Javier Chapa, a Texas labor broker who runs Chapa Global Contracting. Chapa was allegedly hired by Remington to recruit, house and supervise migrant farmworkers in Iowa, Nebraska and Texas.

Their lawsuit claims the defendants violated the law that requires employers to pay American workers, such as the plaintiffs, the same wages paid to foreigners enrolled in the H-2A program, which allows foreign nationals to fill temporary agricultural jobs.
The plaintiffs allege that Chapa concealed the fact that he was employing higher-paid foreign nationals in a seed-corn processing plant in Nebraska, and that Chapa also refused to let the plaintiffs take the higher-paying Nebraska jobs.
The lawsuit claims that for five years, Chapa recruited the plaintiffs to travel from Texas to Iowa where they worked in Remington’s seed-corn processing facility in DeWitt.
In August, at the beginning of each work season, Chapa allegedly had the workers gather in McAllen, Texas, where they were required to board a bus bound for Iowa. Once in Iowa, the plaintiffs were required to stay for the season at a Quality Inn hotel in Clinton where they were allegedly barred from eating the complimentary breakfast offered to other guests each morning.
The workers allege they sometimes slept four to a single two-bed room, forcing them to either sleep with each other or on the floor, and that they were required to reimburse Chapa for the cost of their lodging. In October, at the end of each season, the workers returned to Texas on another bus chartered by Chapa.
The plaintiffs allege that in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, they were each required to reimburse Chapa for the cost of their lodging as well as $450 for bus rides and meals, and that they were barred from using their personal vehicles.
The reimbursements for transportation, meals and lodging, which the lawsuit characterizes as “kickbacks” paid by the workers to Chapa, effectively reduced their overtime wages to a level below the federally mandated minimum compensation.
The lawsuit also alleges Chapa failed to comply with the federal law that requires any person who owns or controls housing for migrant agricultural workers to ensure the housing complies with federal safety and health standards.
The lawsuit alleges violations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act, and seeks damages for lost wages, lodging in “substandard housing at the Quality Inn,” and for discrimination that resulted in them being barred from eating breakfast at the hotel.
The lawsuit also seeks an injunction requiring the defendants to comply with the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act.
Chapa declined to comment on the lawsuit when contacted by the Iowa Capital Dispatch. Calls to Remington Seeds were not immediately returned on Thursday.

The Senate will vote next week on wide-ranging legislation that would erect strict guardrails around collection and distribution of personal data, a practice that has become ubiquitous with cell phones in every pocket. 
Under the bill top Senate Democrats unveiled, Bay Staters would gain new power to understand what information companies are gathering, correct any inaccuracies, and opt out of allowing their data to be sold, including for targeted advertising. The proposal seeks even tighter limits around personal data for minors. 
Senate President Karen Spilka said the bill would give Massachusetts “the strongest, strictest data privacy laws in the entire country.” 
“This legislation is going to end the Wild West of data collection in Massachusetts,” she said. “We give residents control over what information is shared, and we make clear that kids should be off-limits, totally off-limits, and this will protect minors from surveillance and targeted advertising. It’s going to put consumers in the driver’s seat.” 
The proposal will likely trigger a political fight between Massachusetts lawmakers and some of the most powerful companies – including Facebook and Google – in the country, who for years have been gathering, sharing and selling user data as a core part of their business. 
Senate Majority Leader Cynthia Creem, the chamber’s point-person on the topic, said her team “met with everyone, anyone that wanted to meet with us.”  
“Nobody likes controls,” Creem replied when asked if she expects industry opposition. “The fact that we’re going to be collecting less data means less sales, less information they have to sell to other people.” 
Representatives for Google, Meta and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. 
Earlier this year, Andrew Kingman, a lawyer representing a coalition that includes Amazon, Google and Meta, praised a different data-privacy bill filed by House Majority Leader Kate Hogan, which overlaps with the new Senate proposal in several ways. It similarly seeks to give consumers new power to understand what data companies have collected and to opt out of having that information sold, but the Hogan measure took a somewhat different approach to regulating collection of data from minors. 
That Hogan bill is similar to the framework in place in most other states that have enacted new data-privacy laws other than California, Kingman told a legislative committee in April. 
Absent a consensus on data privacy in Washington, DC, state governments have been left to pursue their own varying approaches to the topic, at times drawing opposition from Silicon Valley giants or more local businesses who might also be affected. 
Twenty other states had “comprehensive data privacy laws in place” as of April 7, according to Bloomberg Law. 
It’s not yet clear if the plan from Senate Democrats has buy-in from other Beacon Hill power players. House Speaker Ron Mariano and his deputies have not outlined any specific position on addressing data privacy this term. Spokespeople for Attorney General Andrea Campbell, whose office would gain sole enforcement authority under the Senate bill, did not comment immediately Thursday afternoon. 
For years, tech companies have been collecting information from their users and selling personalized advertisements based on a consumer’s recent internet activity. 
“I don’t think there’s any doubt in my mind that this [data] is being sold, and there are no rules limiting it now,” Creem said. 
Creem said the 33-page bill rolled out Thursday weaves together “best practices” already deployed in other states. 
Companies would be allowed to gather only data “reasonably necessary to provide or maintain” their product or service, which Creem said would decrease the total amount of information collected. 
Consumers – defined as residents of Massachusetts – would gain the ability to see which third parties have gained access to their information, delete personal details, and opt out of both the sale of personal data and also data collection related to targeted ads. 
The bill seeks even stronger protections around “sensitive data,” which would include anything involving a government-issued identifier such as a Social Security number, health status, biometric data, a consumer’s precise location, demographic identifiers such as religion or citizenship status, and information related to sexual orientation, gender identity, or sexual activity. 
Sale of that more sensitive data would be outright banned. A company could still transfer that kind of data without any financial transaction involved but would first need to obtain a user’s affirmative consent. 
The proposal would also prohibit the sale of any data collected from a minor. Creem said the bill “bans all targeted advertising to minors, period.” 
Enforcement of the proposed new law would fall to the attorney general’s office. The bill would not create a private right of action, meaning that individual consumers would not be empowered to file lawsuits themselves if they feel their data has been misused. Vermont lawmakers considered a private right of action last year when they took up their own data-privacy proposal, but the measure proved controversial. 
Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said Massachusetts “urgently needs this state law to ensure that data brokers and others do not collect or manipulate our personal information in ways that threaten our safety, discriminate against us, or otherwise violate our privacy.” 
“Protecting privacy is more urgent today than ever before, as the Trump administration unleashes attack after attack on our most cherished rights and freedoms — and as Big Tech interests do all they can to amass power,” Rose said in a statement. 
Massachusetts Democrats already teamed up this year to enact a new law expanding protections for patients and providers of reproductive and gender-affirming care, including by limiting the release of sensitive health care data targeted by some Republican-controlled states. 
Creem said the new measure “complements” that law, and Spilka described it as the latest entry in her chamber’s response to President Donald Trump. 
“We know that Big Tech companies are sharing and they are profiting from that data, your data, and it’s clear that they have cozied up to Trump and would do whatever he wants, even if that means sharing your sensitive data like biometrics, your location, your personal health data, including reproductive health,” Spilka said. “This means that those companies who have cozied up to Trump will not be able to store that data and would not have it if the federal government ever came asking for it.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09-18_Creem_1_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C648&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-18 16:57:11.614114

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Roughly 1,000 Hoosiers crowded into the Indiana Statehouse Thursday afternoon to hear from former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, who headlined a high-energy rally opposing mid-decade redistricting. 
The former Democratic presidential candidate appeared alongside other state party leaders in the latest public demonstration, with attendees craning to see Buttigieg from three separate floors. President Donald Trump has urged Hoosier Republicans to redraw congressional boundary lines ahead of the 2026 midterm elections in order to maintain a Republican majority.

“We are here because Indiana Republicans are being pressured by Washington (D.C.) Republicans to do something that they know in their hearts is wrong,” Buttigieg said, pausing between roaring cheers. “They are being pressured to change the rules so that voters don’t have a say anymore … and we know why they’re doing it, which is because the agenda of Washington Republicans is so unpopular that even here in Indiana, they are afraid of losing.”
Posters throughout the crowd criticized the partisan maneuver, accusing Republicans of “cheating” to add seats by gerrymandering districts.
Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, said that mayors don’t have that option if their constituents disagree with their views.
“You’ve got to go in, get work done and stand before everybody in an election and be judged on your results,” Buttigieg said. “And that is how every election is supposed to work in the United States.”
The native Hoosier now lives with his family in Michigan.
Specifically, assembled Democrats picked at Trump’s priority legislation signed into law earlier this summer. That effort establishes work requirements for certain Medicaid recipients, cuts federal aid for food benefits and implements tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthy. Other administrative actions — such as tariffs, targeting immigrants for deportation and discontinuing international food donations — have hurt farmers and small businesses who rely on foreign markets for labor or supplies. 
“Even here in this so-called red state, those policies and those results are not a winning message. Those results aren’t working; those policies aren’t working,” said Buttigieg. “Where I grew up — which happens to be Indiana — if what you’re doing isn’t working, you rethink what you’re doing. 
“But instead of changing their policies or trying to get better results, they decided to just try to change the map instead.”
 ’A racist power grab’

Democrats hold just two of Indiana’s nine congressional seats, located in deep-blue Marion County and the northwestern corner of Indiana near Chicago. Both are more racially and ethnically diverse than the rest of the state, potentially opening the door for legal challenges, though their minority voting populations are relatively small. 
“We have to call this out for what it is: this is a racist power grab to silence voters who look like me,” said Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis. “… things feel really tough right now, but we stand on the shoulders of ancestors and freedom fighters who’ve been here before and who’ve done the work before, and so we need to follow their lead.” 
Indiana Republicans go to Washington D.C., critics rebuff redistricting push

All seven of Indiana’s U.S. House Republicans have signaled their support, as has Sen. Jim Banks, who urged adopting maps with zero Democratic representation. Democrats reliably win 40% of the vote in statewide elections.
“They want the outcome of the election to be decided before you even get to go vote. They want this to be one of those countries where you don’t even have to wait for the results to know how the vote is going to turn out — and we have a word for that,” Buttigieg said. 
Attendees chimed in with “unfair,” “undemocratic,” and “dictatorship,” to which Buttigieg responded, “Okay, we have a lot of words for that.
“But the word I’m going to go with is cheating,” he said.
A left-leaning pollster found that the majority of Hoosiers, regardless of party affiliation, opposed redistricting outside of the traditional ten-year cycle. 
Gov. Mike Braun said this week that a special session is likely to be called for November and other topics could also be addressed. Braun hinted that the state could risk its status with the Trump administration if it doesn’t comply.
Some politicians have openly wondered if Braun and other Republican leaders couldn’t rally enough GOP support for a one-topic session. 
“They’re hesitating, even with all the pressure coming their way from Washington,” Buttigieg said. “A lot of them haven’t quite committed to doing the deed.”
He urged those assembled to reach out to not only their representatives, but also encourage their conservative family members to also contact their elected officials. 
“We need to prove something that I was taught growing up in this state, which is that cheaters never win in the end,” Buttigieg concluded. “And that means we’re working harder to make sure we get new and better leadership, even when it’s uphill — especially when it’s uphill.”
Because Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers, Democrats can’t prevent new maps through the legislative process. Voting rights groups have vowed to sue if the state adopts new districts.

Kelly Armstrong announced Thursday.
The B-52 Operational Classic Association detachment will support the B-52 mission under the 5th Bomb Wing of the Air Force and the Air National Guard’s 119th Wing, according to a news release from the governor’s office.
About 40 Guard members are expected to make up the new support detachment and could be integrated into the base and assist with bomber operations as soon as Oct. 1, 2026. The Air Force Global Strike Command will also develop plans to expand the new detachment in the future.
“The military in North Dakota continues to play a critical role in our national security, ensuring peace through strength, and this new detachment reinforces that role,” Armstrong said in a statement. “Minot Air Force Base and the North Dakota Air National Guard are always exceeding the standard and setting new expectations of what it means to serve in our military.”
In a statement, Brig. Gen. Mitchell Johnson, adjutant general for the North Dakota National Guard, said the new detachment will expand the Guard’s relationship with the Air Force base and adds a strategic deterrent to the mission.
“We will recruit the right people into these positions and build this detachment the North Dakota way,” Johnson said.
The North Dakota Guard members already support Minot Air Force Base by assisting Air Force personnel with security for missiles at the base.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The number of overdose deaths has been on a decline in recent years, but people should remain vigilant about counterfeit pills and other drugs, especially with new illicit substances on the rise, officials said Thursday.
In South Carolina, the number of overdose deaths decreased nearly 30% between April 2024 and 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was higher than the national average of about 24%, said Michael Tooley, who oversees the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Columbia office.


By the numbers
So far in 2025, as of Thursday, the Drug Enforcement Administration in South Carolina has:

Seized 232 kilograms of cocaine
Seized 143 kilograms of fentanyl
Seized 111 kilograms of methamphetamine
Charged 253 people with drug crimes
Seized about $2.2 million involved in drug sales

Source: Drug Enforcement Administration


That continued a trend of decreasing overdose deaths, which declined in the state in 2023 for the first time in nearly a decade, according to the state Department of Public Health.
The exact reason for fewer deaths is unclear, Tooley told reporters Thursday.
Part of the reason may be that more people know about and carry naloxone, often referred to by the brand name Narcan, which can reverse an opioid overdose, he said.
“I think public awareness is helping significantly,” he said. “People know what to look for now.”
Health clinics and schools have begun offering the medication for free in recent years, in an effort to increase awareness. The Department of Public Health offers free opioid overdose kits at its local health clinics, which include naloxone nasal spray, as well as test strips to detect fentanyl and xylazine, which are highly fatal substances often mixed into other drugs without the buyer knowing.
The University of South Carolina began making naloxone available for free in 2022, a move that other public colleges soon followed. In 2023, legislators passed a law creating a list of lifesaving medications nurses in K-12 public schools were allowed to administer, including naloxone.
And state prisons offer naloxone to visitors, since people with a loved one convicted of a drug crime often know others at risk of overdosing, said Bryan Stirling, acting U.S. attorney and former director of the state Department of Corrections.
Because of the rise in awareness of naloxone, a decrease in deaths doesn’t mean a decrease in overdoses, Tooley said. And new synthetic drugs that are more fatal, more potent and less responsive to naloxone, such as the highly lethal fentanyl, can pose new dangers, he said.

Naloxone only works on opioid overdoses, so for drugs such as xylazine that don’t come from opiates, the medication will be ineffective, Tooley said. High-potency opioids known as nitazenes might require multiple doses of naloxone to reverse the effects, Tooley said.
Drug enforcement agents have not yet found nitazenes in South Carolina, Tooley said. With busts uncovering the substance in Texas and New York, however, he warned that it was likely a matter of time before the drug arrived in the Palmetto State, he said.
Dealers frequently mix the cheaper and highly deadly fentanyl, xylazine and nitazenes with other drugs or pass them off as prescription medications to maximize profits and increase the high a person gets, bringing them back for more, Tooley said.
That also increases the risk of overdoses, since people often don’t know what they’re getting, he said.
For instance, a person without a prescription trying to get a certain drug might believe they’re buying oxycodone, Adderall or Xanax only to end up with fake pills containing a much more deadly substance, Tooley said. Not knowing what’s in the pills, which are often nearly identical to the real thing, a person might accidentally take a deadly dose, he said.
Illicit substances are cheaper to produce than the genuine medications, often selling for as much as 10 times what they’re worth, Tooley said. Plus, getting a person hooked on a much more addictive substance, such as methamphetamine or cocaine, can lead to higher profits for drug dealers, he said.

More than 99% of the pills agents seized during drug busts in 2024 were counterfeit, as opposed to dealers illegally selling the real thing, Tooley said.
Overdose deaths went down as the amount of drugs seized by agents during busts rose, Tooley said.
So far in 2025 in South Carolina alone, the Drug Enforcement Agency has seized 232 kilograms of cocaine, more than triple the 62 kilograms found during all of 2024. And fentanyl busts increased seven-fold, from 18 kilograms in 2024 to more than 140 kilograms in 2025, Tooley said.
In July, drug enforcement agents carried out the largest seizure of fentanyl in state history, uncovering 71 kilograms, or 156 pounds, of the drug from a tractor trailer in Lexington County, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
People should remain diligent, Tooley said.
Patients should only take medications prescribed by a licensed doctor, and parents should talk to their children about the dangers of drugs, many of which are advertised through social media as if they were legal, Tooley said.
“Don’t take this warning lightly,” Tooley said. “It only takes one counterfeit pill with a lethal dose of fentanyl to kill you or your loved one.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4476-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 16:57:11.614114

(Photo courtesy of the Courier Journal)Andy Wolfson, an investigative reporter for more than 44 years at The Courier Journal and its former afternoon affiliate, the Louisville Times, has died. He was 70.
Wolfson died Sept. 17 at his home in Louisville where he had been managing several health problems, including recovery from a stroke last year, according to his wife, Mary Welp.
His death was reported Thursday by The Courier Journal, where he served as an award-winning journalist covering the justice system and other subjects for most of his career. 
His work helped The Courier Journal win two Pulitzer Prizes, one in 1989 for team coverage of the fiery Carroll County church bus crash that killed 27 children and adults. In 2020, he was among reporters who won a Pulitzer for the coverage of a flurry of last-minute, highly-controversial pardons by outgoing Gov. Matt Bevin.
But Wolfson, who retired in 2024, was best known for his work covering legal affairs and the justice system, including reporting on the case of a man on Kentucky’s death row, Gregory Wilson, who was freed after Wolfson’s work outlined Wilson’s poor legal representation and other flaws in the prosecution, The Courier Journal reported.
He was known and largely respected by lawyers and judges throughout the commonwealth and beyond.
“I think he’s the best investigative reporter in Kentucky,” Scott Cox, a prominent Louisville defense lawyer and former prosecutor said when Wolson retired last year, according to The Courier Journal. Cox called Wolfson “fearless” and said he “doesn’t back down.”
Brusque and at times abrasive, Wolfson was known for asking pointed questions and striking alarm in subjects through an unexpected call or visit.
Among stories Wolfson liked to tell on himself: Some years ago, he visited Jefferson District Court to protest a traffic ticket he believed was unfair.
The judge was calling cases alphabetically and he waited several hours till most of the other cases were called, the courtroom cleared, and the judge, recognizing Wolfson, asked what he was doing in the courtroom.
Wolfson explained he came to protest a ticket. The judge, in relief, said he thought Wolfson was there to investigate his handling of traffic court and promptly addressed his complaint.
A native of Connecticut, Wolfson graduated from Colorado College and Northwestern University, where he received a master’s degree from the Medill School of Journalism in 1977.
He came to work in Louisville in 1980, first at the Louisville Times, before moving in 1983 to the morning statewide newspaper, The Courier Journal.
He is survived by his wife, Mary Welp; a son, Wylie Wolfson; his sister, Ellen Wolfson; her husband, Neil Grosberg, and a niece and nephew.

Chris Murphy said the Trump administration is using the Charlie Kirk shooting to justify going after those who don't agree with Trump.,"U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy has long warned about what he sees as the erosion of democracy. In the early days of President Donald Trump’s second term, Murphy mused about the possibility of the president going after political opponents.
Now, he believes Trump is turning the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk into an opportunity to do just that — a message he has fiercely and repeatedly made over the past week.
Murphy didn’t back down from his grim and dire warnings on Thursday, pointing to the indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late night show as the latest example of how he sees the administration using Kirk’s death as an excuse and justification for going after those who don’t agree with Trump. And Republicans who once championed free speech have changed their tune — or are silent, he argued.
“That’s censorship. That’s state speech control. That’s not America,” Murphy said. “Trump is making it 100% clear that he is going to ramp up his efforts to use the power of the federal government to harass and punish his critics. Not because they’re supporters of political violence — they are not — but because they have the audacity to openly oppose his policies. They aren’t even hiding what they are trying to do.”
In the week since the calls for peace and unity in Connecticut and elsewhere, the familiar political tensions have cropped back up.
And Murphy, who has been lauded on the left as an emerging leader of the party and criticized by the right as a Trump antagonist, has been persistent in his argument that democracy is on the line.
He led a Thursday press conference about new legislation called the “No Political Enemies Act” that appears to have only Democratic support. The bill would provide more protections for free speech in court by “creat[ing] a specific defense for those who are being targeted for political reasons” and covering their attorney’s fees.
He said it would also establish consequences for officials who use their government influence to target speech they don’t like, pointing to Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr’s criticism of Kimmel for his comments about the shooting suspect’s political affiliation, which came hours before ABC’s decision to cancel the show.
“The shooting of Charlie Kirk was a national tragedy. It should have been a line in the sand, an opportunity for President Trump to bring this country together to do whatever is necessary to stamp out political violence that’s targeted both Republicans and Democrats, political violence that emanates from both right-wing and left-wing radicalization,” Murphy said.
After losing a close ally in Kirk who mobilized young conservatives on high school and college campuses, Trump and his allies are ramping up an expanded crackdown on liberal organizations.
As a guest host on Kirk’s podcast earlier this week, Vice President JD Vance said the federal government will go after any group that “foments, facilitates and engages in violence.” He specifically named groups like the Ford Foundation and Open Society Foundations, which is funded by Democratic megadonor George Soros. But the White House is reportedly putting together a list of left-leaning organizations that they believe are complicit in political violence.
That caused alarmed for Democrats like Murphy.
“I think you’ve already seen them shamelessly use the judicial system to target Democrats. Trump has made it very clear that he’s talking about going after mainstream progressive groups and mainstream progressive donors, including the Soros family,” Murphy said in an interview earlier this week.
“They’re going to try to exploit this moment in order to shut down political dissent. I don’t think they’ll be successful, but part of our work has to be naming it so that they don’t get away with winning the argument about what the motive is,” Murphy added.
His comments came before Kimmel’s show was indefinitely pulled off the air.
Trump and his allies are taking a multi-pronged approach to reprimand those they view as adversarial: potential racketeering charges, reviewing tax-exempt statuses of nonprofits like the one run by Soros, and urging people to report employees at work who celebrate or mock Kirk’s death. The State Department said it will deny visas over celebratory messages and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi would go after “hate speech.”
“The last message that Charlie Kirk gave to me before he joined his creator in heaven was he said that we have to dismantle and take on the radical left organizations in this country that are fomenting violence. That was the last message that he sent me,” White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a recent Fox News interview. “We are gonna do that.”
Murphy, in response to Miller and others with similar messages, issued an ominous warning in a series of posts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter: “Pay attention. Something dark might be coming.”

Pay attention. Something dark might be coming. The murder of Charlie Kirk could have united Americans to confront political violence. Instead, Trump and his anti-democratic radicals look to be readying a campaign to destroy dissent. 1/ Here's what's happening. https://t.co/UI8X9EabBR— Chris Murphy  (@ChrisMurphyCT) September 14, 2025

Murphy has been vocal since Democrats lost the November elections that they need to recalibrate and be willing to more forcefully respond to Trump. And many times that has caught the attention of the White House and the president himself, who lashed out at the Connecticut senator over his comments about Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In a statement to HuffPost, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson pointed to Murphy’s own comments made days before the shooting that “we’re in a war right now to save this country,” arguing he’s “leaning into inflammatory rhetoric that drives leftists to violence.”
Murphy said he was responding to a question about disputes over redistricting. Trump asked Texas to redraw its congressional maps for the explicit purpose of netting more seats for Republicans. Since then, California has sought to redo its own maps to favor Democrats, and other red states have also followed suit.
Republicans, including Connecticut Republican Party chairman Ben Proto, have also taken issue with Murphy’s rhetoric. The GOP leader said social media has exacerbated things and helped ratchet up the rhetoric on both sides, though he laid more of the blame on Democrats.
“He more than anyone else should know people take stuff literally,” Proto said. “It’s less about what you’re saying and more about how you’re saying it, and how is it interpreted by someone who doesn’t know you … but knows you’re a leader. How we say things and the words that are chosen in very short snippets have impact on people.”
The Connecticut senator argued his use of metaphorical political speech used by members in both parties isn’t the same as the speech and actions from the president.
“We all use fighting terms when we talk about politics, but that is fundamentally different than what Donald Trump has done, which is literally pardon people for violent political acts simply because they were supporters of his,” Murphy said.
Trump and many Republicans have blamed the left wing of the Democratic Party for the shooting as the investigation into the shooting is underway. And they believe that the left’s rhetoric and choice of words have encouraged political violence.
Murphy was asked about that Thursday, as well as whether Democrats have a responsibility to rethink how they speak about Republicans. He was asked about using language about fascism to describe the administration, since the shooting suspect engraved ammunition with references to fascists.
But Murphy didn’t waver. He said it was imperative not to back down or downplay what he believes he’s witnessing.
“[Trump] is acting in a way that is scarily similar to many would-be despots all across this world, all across history, who have tried to transition a country from democracy to autocracy,” Murphy told reporters Thursday. “And so we have no obligation to sugarcoat the gravity of this moment.”
More details are starting to emerge about the alleged shooter and his motives over the past couple of days. Records showed text exchanges saying that he had “had enough of [Kirk’s] hatred.”
On Sunday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said authorities didn’t have a motive, but, based on interviews with relatives, “there clearly was a leftist ideology.” But Cox cautioned against focusing solely on that and said he’s more concerned about “radicalization” that drives such violence, including the Minnesota Democratic legislator who was killed in the summer.
But political violence has been a scourge on both the right and the left, especially over the past year.
That has raised major concerns about the safety of political figures and elected lawmakers, particularly when they’re at off-campus events. Proto said a member of Congress who plans to visit Connecticut next week asked about having a police presence at all events. The GOP chairman said he’s never had that before.
“I don’t know if it’s going to get better anytime soon,” Proto said. “I’m just hoping it doesn’t get worse.”
Some Democrats have applauded Cox’s handling of the situation and calls for unity and civility. U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, believes more national Republicans should emulate that approach.
“Some of the Republican members … decided they would seize that moment without a fact in the world, not to be solemn, not to urge calm, but to say ‘you did this’ to the Democrats,” Himes said.
“This is the message coming out of the Oval Office. This is a way to get more violence,” he said. “A leader takes a deep breath. A leader says we don’t do violence in this country.”
In Connecticut, political tensions didn’t seem to be as high as those enveloping the nation’s capital. But the two party chairs, who had days earlier penned a joint statement on taking a step back and reflecting, had a back-and-forth over a national Republican committee that singled out U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, for not acknowledging the shooting after five days.
Connecticut Democratic Chair Roberto Alves called the remarks from the National Republican Congressional Committee “extremely dangerous” and called on Proto to get it retracted by national Republicans. The state GOP chair pushed back that the comments were “not necessarily politically violent language” and called on Democrats to look inward at their own political speech, according to the Hartford Courant.
Hayes pushed back on the NRCC’s statement, saying in a statement she has spoken against political violence throughout her time in Congress. On Friday, a couple of days after the shooting, she wrote a letter to leadership on the House Education and Workforce Committee asking for a hearing on school shootings. U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, who also sits on the committee, signed her letter.
But Democrats argue that Republicans, as the party in control of Congress and the White House, bear the responsibility of lowering the temperature and not jumping to conclusions as the investigation into Kirk’s death plays out.
For Republicans in Connecticut, they’re largely staying out of Trump’s hard-line approach.
“I think everybody is who they are, and they’re gonna do what they do. And I can deal with my little piece of the world up here,” Proto said when asked Trump’s own rhetoric.
“I understand my role as a partisan,” Proto added, noting his work trying to elect Republicans to local offices around Connecticut this fall. “I can’t control what comes out of Washington on either side of the aisle.”
Asked if he agrees with Trump’s crackdown on left-leaning institutions, Proto gave a more muted response but appeared open to investigating and prosecuting any groups that break the law.
“I think we can have the political debate, and we can fall out with political opponents. If they’re engaged in activities that are illegal, then yes, they should be investigated and prosecuted,” Proto said. “I’m concerned about the rhetoric getting to the point where it induces action — and the action that we saw last week and we’ve seen in other instances around the country.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-12.28.06-PM-1024x571.png,,,2025-09-18 16:57:11.614114
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-18 20:27:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Report: CT added 900 jobs in August, as labor force waned",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/18/ct-jobs-report-labor-force/,"Report comes after large downward revision on national job numbers. And while CT saw slight growth in jobs, overall labor force tells different story.","While national job growth has weakened, growth in Connecticut is stable, albeit low, according to new numbers released Thursday.
Employers in the state added 900 jobs in August according to the latest jobs report, which tracks trends in the state’s labor market and is released monthly by the Connecticut Department of Labor. The report also notes that the previous month’s jobs numbers are better than initially reported, with the state gaining 800 jobs in July rather than the 700 it first reported. 
Connecticut’s unemployment rate, meanwhile, remained at 3.8% for the fourth month in a row. That’s lower than the national unemployment rate, 4.3%.  
In a press release announcing the jobs report, state labor commissioner Danté Bartolomeo said the numbers suggest that on some economic measures, Connecticut is faring better than the nation more broadly. “Despite volatility in the national numbers, Connecticut’s economic indicators remain steady,” Bartolomeo said. 
Other members of the department agreed. “Connecticut continues to see stable, sustainable growth,” said CTDOL Director of Research Patrick Flaherty. “Private sector payrolls hit new highs last month and total jobs — public and private sector — are only off their 2008 all-time high by about 700 payroll jobs.”  
Still, the jobs report arrived at a moment of heightened economic uncertainty, both nationally and in Connecticut. And after a weaker summer jobs performance than expected nationally, the latest jobs numbers suggest that even with fairly stable growth, Connecticut, like other states, is facing some economic headwinds.  
A persistent labor force problem
While the jobs numbers suggest a somewhat steady state for job growth a different figure — focused on the state’s labor force as a whole — tells a different story.
The labor force participation rate is used to measure how much of the working-age population in a place are actively working or looking for employment. The number is related to, but different from, the unemployment rate, which generally tracks people who are not working but are actively searching for a position. Labor force numbers, some economists argue, are a better indication of labor conditions.
Connecticut’s labor force participation rate is currently 64.6%, slightly higher than the national rate of 62.3%. 
But the jobs report notes that Connecticut is continuing to see a decline in its labor force overall, as retirements rise and working-age adults move away from the state or leave the labor force for other reasons.
In August, the state’s labor force declined by 4,100. From June to August the state’s labor force declined by 10,300. A shrinking labor force can be a concerning economic indicator: if the effects are prolonged, fewer available workers can create a problem for employers and limit economic output more broadly. 
This issue isn’t isolated to Connecticut, but when coupled with the state’s high cost of living and stagnant population growth that is primarily offset by international migration, the numbers are raising concerns locally. 
“The labor force numbers are really concerning, with the population of those working or looking for work down 4,100 people last month alone and 12-month growth essentially flat,” Chris DePentima, president and CEO of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said in a statement released Thursday afternoon.
And slow job growth coupled with a declining labor force could also suggest a deeper weakening in the economy. In recent months, a number of reports have suggested that Connecticut is dealing with a persistent affordability and cost of living crisis, with families and workers noting that it is becoming more difficult to navigate life in the state. 
Businesses are also feeling the squeeze, according to a recent CBIA survey, business owners are reporting dealing with rising costs and a shortage in available workers. 
The national economy is also showing warning signs
The latest state jobs report comes as economic uncertainty continues to be felt across the country, with that uncertainty now being supported by recent jobs data.
Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks jobs and other related data across the country, released a preliminary report finding that national hiring numbers from March 2024 to March 2025 were overcounted by more than 900,000 jobs. 
While the annual hiring numbers are usually revised, and the final numbers won’t be released until next year, the size of the recent revision was unusually large, drawing considerable attention and renewed criticism from President Donald Trump, who has previously accused the BLS of politicizing and manipulating jobs data. 
The president fired the head of the BLS in August, arguing that the jobs data released that month (which showed the economy added just 22,000 jobs) “were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.” The former agency head, Erika McEntarfer, has disavowed that argument, maintaining that her role was nonpartisan in nature. 
When the jobs revision came out earlier this month, the White House said in a statement that “the economy President Trump inherited was even weaker than we thought,” adding that “job growth was lackluster under Biden.”
Concerns over the economy have intensified in recent months, as businesses continue to navigate shifting federal policies on immigration, a reduction in the federal workforce, and changes in tariffs and trade policy. Slower than expected job growth, the news of some job declines, and more job seekers than available positions in the labor market are adding to those concerns. 
The weakening labor market has led to efforts to stabilize the economy. The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate this week, and has signaled that it may reduce rates further in the coming months in the hopes of boosting the economy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/231121_EEP_Ridgefield-small-businesses7-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-09-18 17:58:02.118885

Ned Lamont asked the Connecticut Siting Council to postpone a final vote scheduled for Thursday.,"Opponents of a proposed high-voltage transmission line in Fairfield County won a temporary reprieve on Thursday as the Connecticut Siting Council voted to table the issue to allow more time to study alternative routes.
The move came two days after Gov. Ned Lamont waded into the dispute over the transmission line by writing a letter to the Siting Council, asking it to postpone a final vote that had been scheduled for Thursday. At the same time, Lamont said he was meeting behind the scenes with the project’s developer, United Illuminating, about a compromise.
While the governor lacks any formal authority to request a delay from the Siting Council — an independent agency tasked with locating power plants, transmission lines and other essential infrastructure — his request was echoed in a filing submitted Wednesday by several parties to the matter, including the cities of Bridgeport and Fairfield.
During the Siting Council’s meeting on Thursday afternoon, council member Brian Golembiewski made a motion to table the vote until Oct. 16, which was agreed to unanimously.
Lamont’s office released a statement following the vote thanking the Siting Council for agreeing to a delay. 
“My office is in the process of convening a meeting with representatives of all parties to facilitate a discussion on potential alternatives and a path forward,” Lamont said.
Likewise, local officials from the two towns impacted by the proposed transmission line expressed relief at the delay. Earlier this month, the council held a non-biding straw poll in which a majority of council members voted to support the project.
“I am very happy that they tabled the matter,” Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim said in a test message. “I want to thank all the elected officials and the Governor especially for requesting a delay and hopefully a different result when they ultimately vote.”
United Illuminating did not comment on the council’s decision Thursday prior to publication of this article.
The utility’s proposal, known formally as the Fairfield to Congress Railroad Transmission Line, would move its existing transmission lines from the aging cantenary structures above the Metro-North rail corridor onto a series of large monopoles that would be built mostly along the south side of the railroad tracks.
The proposed route has drawn the ire of local residents and town officials who say the height of the proposed poles — up to 195 feet — would tower over neighborhoods while suspending high-voltage wires near homes, businesses, churches and a library. 
A portion of the easement being sought by United Illuminating to build the transmission line passes directly over the sanctuary, basketball court and playground of the Shiloh Baptist Church, an 85-year-old congregation located in Bridgeport’s South End. 
“There would be no place for the kids to play basketball,” said the Rev. Carl McCluster, the senior pastor at Shiloh Baptist. “The playground could not be used because you could not enter it, because of the easement that would take away the entrance to the back playground.”
Opponents of the project have repeatedly sought to have UI bury the transmission line underground. The utility has argued that doing so would add up to $500 million in costs to the project’s existing $300 million price tag — estimates that critics argue are wildly inflated.
In an effort to forge a compromise that addressed some of the local concerns, the Siting Council last year came up with its own route, shifting some poles onto the north sides of the tracks through portions of Fairfield. Opponents of that route filed a lawsuit, and in April a judge ruled that the council had exceeded its authority by deviating from the utility’s proposal.
As a result, the original plan went back before the members of the Siting Council for reconsideration. 
Earlier this month, the council met and held a non-bonding straw vote in which two members who had previously opposed the original UI route said they planned to allow the project to move forward. Another member who had previously abstained also indicated they planned to vote yes.
One of those members who switched their vote, Khristine Hall, said during the meeting that she had gone “back and forth, back and forth,” over the utility’s proposal, which she called the most difficult decision she’s had to make during her year-long tenure on the council. 
Ultimately, she said, costs ended up being a significant factor in the decision. “It cannot be ignored, particularly in the state of Connecticut, when utility bills are so high.”
Lamont told reporters earlier this week that any additional costs for adjusting the route of the transmission line could be spread out among roughly 14 million electric customers in New England if they are determined to be for safety or other practical purposes, rather than purely aesthetic ones.
That process, known as regionalization, is governed by ISO New England, the operator of the six-state electric grid. A spokeswoman for ISO-NE said this week that the organization has yet to review the proposed Fairfield-Congress line but that projects that are moved underground due to state siting decisions are not eligible to have their incremental costs covered on a regional basis.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6500-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-18 17:58:02.118885

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/18/ct-connecticut-sun-gop-pension-oversight/,"CT Republicans called for a board to oversee CT pension funds, given Gov. Ned Lamont's interest in keeping the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun in CT.","Republican legislative leaders renewed their call Thursday for a professional board to oversee future investments of state pension funds, particularly given Gov. Ned Lamont’s interest in using those assets to keep the  WNBA’s Connecticut Sun playing here.
“There needs to be structure and fiscal responsibility and a level of respect for taxpayer money and for public employees’ money,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said during a late morning press conference in the Legislative Office Building.
With the Democratic-controlled General Assembly expected to come into special session next month, Republicans pledged Thursday to reintroduce a bill that would create a board of financial experts who would share authority with the state’s treasurer over the investment of the more than $60 billion in pension assets Connecticut holds.
Currently, the treasurer has sole authority to invest those funds, with some limitations. The state does have an Investment Advisory Council that approves a general strategic plan for investments the treasurer must follow. It also stipulates specific shares of the total pension assets that must be placed in various investment categories.
But Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, ranking GOP senator on the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said Connecticut is the only state in the nation that gives an elected treasurer this much discretion. Having a team of investment professionals — rather than one person — making these decisions would better ensure that the protection and growth of workers’ retirement savings is prioritized, he added.
“We are not calling for anything different than what any other state in the country and its taxpayers and its state’s employees have,” said Fazio, who introduced an investment reform bill last legislative session only to see it voted down by the Democratic-controlled finance committee.
Fazio, who opened a campaign for governor last month, added that his proposal is not a commentary on Treasurer Erick Russell, a New Haven Democrat. Fazio and other GOP leaders said Russell, who has been treasurer since January 2023, has made progress during his brief tenure in reversing state investment trends that have underperformed for decades.
But Republicans said the prospect of investing significant pension assets in the WNBA franchise — a possibility Lamont raised earlier this month — has many worried.
The priorities behind pension investments should be maximizing returns, which, in turn, protects workers’ retirement savings and Connecticut’s taxpayers, Harding said. But, at first glance, the potential Connecticut Sun investment appears more like an economic development initiative, or even a political maneuver.
Lamont, who is weighing a third term for governor, has expressed a desire to keep the team in Connecticut, either at the Mohegan Sun casino, where it currently plays its home games, or at the recently renamed PeoplesBank Arena in downtown Hartford, formerly known as the XL Center.
The Associated Press reported in early August that a group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca reached a deal to buy the Sun from the Mohegan tribe for $325 million and move the team to Boston for the 2027 season. That sale still requires the approval of the WNBA’s Board of Governors.
Though the governor hasn’t said what amount Connecticut might invest to keep the team here, he did say any move likely would be in conjunction with a private investor, who also would contribute to keep the team here.
“There is a lack of transparency,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said Thursday, describing Lamont’s pursuit of the Sun as “a sort of rapid, haphazard approach.”
Lamont has described it as a good investment. But Candelora noted that when the state has injected funds into past economic development ventures, it hasn’t involved pension assets — and legislators were kept in the know.
Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said Thursday that “This isn’t about sound fiscal management and it’s not about trying to keep the Sun in Connecticut. It’s about some Republicans who want to get a head start on the campaign season by inserting politics into the governor’s economic efforts. 
“If they push the Sun to another state, they’ll blame him for not trying hard enough to keep them, and if we keep them, they’ll find ways to cast shade over the deal,” he said. “This proposal is one of a few being discussed, and if they care about this state and our WNBA basketball team, they can join our efforts rather than booing from the sidelines.”
Russell added that Lamont has presented no investment proposal involving pension assets for retired state workers or municipal teachers to date.
If that happens, though, “any decision to invest state pension funds would be guided by the goal of achieving the best risk-adjusted returns for the retired teachers and dedicated state workers who depend on us for their retirement security,” Russell said. “If we were to move forward, my expectation would be to work in close coordination with the legislature and the governor’s administration.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3459-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-18 16:57:11.614114

(Photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)With roughly 24,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients living in North Carolina, immigrant advocates say a recent rise in detentions threatens to destabilize communities as the Trump administration continues its mass deportation campaign.
The warning comes after Democratic lawmakers and national immigrant rights groups on Thursday denounced what they called an alarming trend of federal authorities detaining DACA recipients, despite their protections under the Obama-era program.
Nearly 20 DACA recipients have been detained in recent months, according to the Home is Here coalition, an organization that tracks such cases.
On Thursday’s press call, lawmakers including Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Alex Padilla of California called on the Department of Homeland Security to clarify its enforcement priorities. 
Padilla said DHS statements that DACA holders could face detention and deportation marked a troubling policy shift. “That was very different than what candidate Trump said last year when he said he supported a solution for Dreamers and DACA participants,” Padilla said.
The Trump administration has said DACA recipients “may be subject to arrest and deportation” because “DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.”
“The Trump administration is killing DACA piece by piece,” said Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas.
Advocates also shared stories of families torn apart. Alejandra, the wife of a DACA recipient, described the arrest of her husband, Paulo Cesar Gomez Lira, in front of their children. “Paulo is not just a case file. He’s a father, a husband and a neighbor. My children and I need him home,” she said. 
In 2023, then-North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein filed a friend-of-the-court brief to push back against a Texas-led effort to end DACA.
“Dreamers should be able to study, work, and contribute to our communities without fear of deportation,” said Stein. “I’ll continue to fight to protect Dreamers and their right to stay in the United States.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dreamers-1024x683-1-1.jpg,,,2025-09-18 16:57:11.614114

What began as a niche alpine sport incident has grown into a prolonged,  high-profile debate over what penalty is fitting for the trail transgression. Michelino Sunseri’s notice of appeal means it won’t be over soon.
The post Grand Teton speed runner appeals guilty conviction for shortcutting appeared first on WyoFile .","When it all began last year in a dirt parking lot at the foot of the Tetons, it was nothing but good vibes. 
Driggs, Idaho runner Michelino Sunseri set off running toward the summit of the Grand Teton, where he had been training for months to climb and descend faster than anyone in history.
When he returned 2 hours and 50 minutes later, the spirit was triumphant. Sunseri had shaved more than two minutes from the record that had stood for 12 years. 
But Sunseri cut a switchback, opting to take what is known as the “old climber’s trail” down the mountain. And that choice proved hugely consequential. It ignited a major legal battle and high-profile debate about alpine-sport ethics and what constitutes overcriminalization in national parks. 
Following a May trial, U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick found Sunseri guilty of the shortcutting offense in a Sept. 2 decision. On Monday, Sunseri’s legal team filed a notice of appeal, signaling that there will be at least one more chapter to the saga over the now-notorious switchback.

“We respectfully disagree with the magistrate judge’s ruling,” Sunseri’s attorney Michel Poon of the Pacific Legal Foundation said in a statement emailed to WyoFile. 
That ruling, he said, “reifies the enormous claims of power by park superintendents to write federal criminal law. This is well beyond any power the Constitution contemplates him to have.”
The fateful route
In the lead-up to the attempt, Sunseri devoted his life to the goal, moving to Togwotee Pass in order to acclimate to a higher elevation. He climbed the peak dozens of times to memorize his route.
On Labor Day 2024 when he set the record, Sunseri cut the switchback to avoid hikers on the designated route. He described his decision in a Strava report shortly after the feat, writing that “If I had to make this choice again, I would 100% make the exact same choice.” 
Some previous record holders also had taken that shortcut, but Sunseri was the first to face formal consequences. Fastest Known Time — the organization that arbitrates and tracks official speed attempts — rejected his submission due to the offense. Shortly after, Grand Teton National Park rangers cited him for violating 36CFR2.1(b), which prohibits “leaving a trail or walkway to shortcut between portions of the same trail or adjacent trail in the national park.” The citation comes with a maximum penalty of $5,000 and six months in jail.
When offered a plea bargain of a misdemeanor conviction, five-year ban from the national park and a fine, Sunseri opted to challenge the charges. That led to the May trial.

Supporters of ultra runner Michelino Sunseri have created stickers, T-shirts and music videos under the label #freemichelino to protest what they say is an over-harsh penalty for his switchback-cutting infraction on the Grand Teton.

Meanwhile, the court of public opinion also weighed in. Sunseri supporters made T-shirts, stickers and social media posts accusing the National Park System of a heavy hand. Others, including Jackson Hole athletes, said Sunseri was setting a poor example of trail stewardship as a sponsored athlete. 
Trail minutiae 
Over the day-and-a-half trial, which unfolded in the Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse in Jackson before Judge Hambrick, eight witnesses took the stand. They included professional athletes and older climbers who had climbed the peak hundreds of times, park rangers and a trails management expert. 
Their testimony offered details on the historic conversation around and use of the switchback-cutting route; the procedures by which park rangers discern whether a citation is appropriate; the private conversations Sunseri had regarding his route and the semantics around trails considered either “established,” “maintained” or “designated.” 
The lawyers’ arguments centered on whether the Park Service properly noticed the closure and fairly cited Sunseri.
Prosecuting attorney Ariel Calmes offered evidence that rangers issued the citation simply because a violation occurred and Sunseri made a confession. Sunseri’s lawyer, Ed Bushnell, argued that the closure was not signed adequately enough to communicate that the established route was closed and that the government did not fulfill the obligations required to enforce trail closures. He indicated that Sunseri was singled out for the violation just because of his social media presence.

The “old climber’s trail” is well-used enough to be a faint singletrack. Small signs posted where the cut leaves and returns to the main trail read “closed for regrowth” and “shortcutting causes erosion.”
Ultimately, Hambrick sided with the prosecution when she determined the trail closure was valid and the park properly communicated the closure, and thus had the authority to cite Sunseri. Trial testimony established that the park superintendent imposed a restriction on shortcutting, she wrote in her filing, which was set forth in what’s known as the 2024 Superintendent’s Compendium. 
“The court finds the restriction consistent with applicable legislation and the federal administrative policies of protecting the natural resources to allow for revegetation and restoration of GTNP and to provide for visitor safety,” Hambrick wrote, before concluding that “The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant was acting voluntarily when he took the [old climber’s trail] shortcut.”
Widespread attention
In the months following Sunseri’s Labor Day climb, the case attracted attention not only in the niche world of alpine sports, but in broader legal and policy realms. 
The speed attempt spurred a lawsuit and debate over filming in national parks that involved the legal advocacy group The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which is known best for its free speech work concerning colleges and universities. National press outlets from Outside Magazine to the New York Post wrote about the legal debate over the shortcut. The case even piqued the interest of members of Congress. 
In July, Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman along with Andy Biggs, R-Arizona, penned a letter to U.S. Attorney Stephanie Sprecher stating that Sunseri’s “prosecution appears to be a prime example of the problem of overcriminalization.”

In this photo posted on Rep. Harriet Hageman’s Instagram, the Wyoming congresswoman hugs Michelino Sunseri. They met to discuss his case, which Hageman says is a clear instance of overcriminalization. (Screenshot/Instagram) 
The representatives brought up a May 9 executive order in which President Donald Trump addressed the criminalization of technical and unintentional regulatory violations.
“President Trump instructed all federal prosecutors to prioritize civil and administrative remedies over criminal enforcement where conduct was unintentional, non-harmful, or gained no advantage,” they wrote. But in Sunseri’s case, they said, it appears that has been ignored. 
“In addition, the decision to prosecute Mr. Sunseri was apparently made over the NPS, the original referring agency, which withdrew its support for criminal prosecution before the trial,” the letter stated. “NPS even noted that the prosecution of Mr. Sunseri was ‘overcriminalization based on the gravity of the offense.’” 
In the wake of the verdict, WyoFile asked Grand Teton National Park if it had changed or modified the trail signage. A park spokesperson referred the inquiry to the Department of Justice. 
Fastest Known Time, however, has updated language on its Grand Teton entry page to emphasize what it calls the “Modern Route” up and down the mountain. The route does not use the old climber’s trail. 
“The Jenny Lake Rangers now prefer that runners stick to designated and maintained trails (where available), which aligns with this Modern Route,” the page reads. “FastestKnownTime indicated it will not accept future submissions using the Historical Route, though it remains an integral part of the mountain’s history and lore.”Andy Anderson, who did not take a shortcut during his blazing 2012 out-and-back time of 2:53:2, remains the official FKT Grand Teton speed record holder.

Todd Clarke, an apartment investment broker in New Mexico for more than 30 years and self-described “data geek and policy wonk,” asserted the higher figure during a breakfast presentation at the summit.. 
After walking through what he sees as four previous statewide housing shortages — those caused by tuberculosis patient arrivals or post World War II expansion, for example — he said the state is in its fifth-ever housing shortage, one that presents a multi-billion-dollar challenge for housing policymakers and developers. 
“We hear numbers about this much demand for affordable housing; this much demand for Northern New Mexico; this much demand for Southern New Mexico, but all in, personally, I believe that number is closer to about 91,000 units,” he said.

He based that number on research he’s doing with the help of a database of all apartment complexes across New Mexico that have at least two units, along with estimates of job and population growth in certain areas across  the state, including in counties experiencing oil and gas development booms, he said. 
Couple that with jobs from tech expansion from Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and others in the Albuquerque area, and the shortage is huge, he said. Clarke expects Albuquerque’s housing shortage to be as high as 25,000 units in the near future, he said.
“Certainly there are some counties that are not growing or actually shrinking, but for every one or two of those, there’s five or six other ones that are absolutely growing gangbusters, particularly those related to oil and extraction of minerals from our state,” Clarke said. 
Assuming a $300,000 per unit cost, that means the state faces a $27 billion problem, he said. 
Clarke’s presentation tracks with other signals that seem to point to an acute housing crisis in New Mexico: Median rents are increasing at rates much higher than the national average, and so is homelessness. 
Housing officials tasked with responding to the crisis seemed to accept Clark’s estimate and incorporated it into their descriptions of the state’s challenges and opportunities related to housing. 
“That’s a huge number,” said Isidoro “Izzy” Hernandez, director of the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority, during a “State of Housing” presentation Thursday morning. “And if you look at the number of permits that we’re issuing annually here in the state, we’ve got a long road ahead.”
The housing shortage was one of many indicators that Hernandez said “are all over the map” in New Mexico, when it comes to inventory, prices and trends.
“I don’t envision that at the end of the session, we’re going to solve all the problems,” Hernandez said. “But I can tell you that there is a lot of progress being made in a lot of effort to solve the problem, and to do more for the housing needs across the state.”
Department of Workforce Solutions Secretary Sarita Nair, whose agency contains the newly created state Office of Housing, touted recent spending of more than $80 million across the state with funds the Legislature approved earlier this year, part of record housing-related spending by the Legislature in recent years.

The funding went primarily to Albuquerque, including for homelessness services, converting an old hotel into affordable apartments and helping new developments break ground. 
Unlike other states, Nair noted, the state does have one advantage in tackling the growing problem, which is that the state has “a lot of money” to spend to both build more housing and make it affordable to people who need it.
“That makes us very unique in the United States. I mean, when I talk to my peers from the other states, they’re cutting. Colorado is cutting budgets. California is cutting budgets. All over the country, they’re cutting budgets,” she said. “We’re not.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2048-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-18 16:57:11.614114

Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, speaks on the Senate floor at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Feb. 6, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The clock is ticking for Utah lawmakers to draw a new congressional map after the courts tossed out the boundaries last drawn in 2021, deeming them a product of an unconstitutional process. 
To meet their tight deadlines, Utah’s legislative leaders have picked 10 lawmakers — eight Republicans and two Democrats from the House and Senate — to form a new legislative redistricting committee. 
Judge orders Utah Legislature to draw new congressional maps

One of the co-chairs of that new committee is Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton. It’s a familiar role for him. He co-chaired the Legislature’s committee back in 2021 (alongside then-Rep. Paul Ray, R-Clearfield) that drew the congressional map that has since been tossed out by 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson. 
Gibson’s ruling last month came after the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, and a handful of Salt Lake County voters sued the Legislature, alleging the 2021 congressional map was unconstitutionally drawn and gerrymandered to favor Republicans. 
Gibson, in her Aug. 25 ruling, agreed on the first claim — that the Utah Legislature violated the Utah Constitution when it repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative that sought to create an independent redistricting commission. Lawmakers turned that commission into an advisory body that they ultimately ignored. 
GOP legislative leaders begrudgingly say they’ll redraw Utah’s congressional map, as court ordered

In her ruling that voided the 2021 congressional map, Gibson made clear that Proposition 4 is now law, while also ordering a remedial process for the court to adopt a new map in time for the 2026 elections. Nov. 10 is the latest the court can select a new congressional map in order to give county clerks enough time to finalize voting precincts before candidates can begin filing for office in January. 
In her ruling, Gibson gave lawmakers until Sept. 25 to publish their proposed replacement map. She also set Oct. 6 as the deadline for the full Legislature to vote on the final map before it’s submitted to the court for consideration. The judge is also allowing the plaintiffs to submit their proposed maps by Oct. 6. Gibson will then have until Nov. 10 to pick a final map to set Utah’s congressional boundaries for the 2026 election. 
Though he was part of the 2021 process that anti-gerrymandering groups, Democrats and other critics have called “blatant gerrymandering,” Sandall said in a prepared statement Thursday that the new committee’s goal is to comply with Proposition 4’s standards. 




Lawmakers picked to serve on the 2025 Legislative Redistricting Committee

Co-chair: Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman
Sen. Mike McKell, R-Spanish Fork

Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City
Rep. Cal Roberts, R-Draper
Rep. Walt Brooks, R-St. George
Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain
Rep. Doug Owens, D-Millcreek





“Redrawing congressional districts is a detailed and intricate task that requires careful analysis, broad input and thoughtful decision-making,” Sandall said. “Our committee’s top priority is to create a fair and balanced map that complies with Proposition 4 and reflects Utah’s growth, incorporates the interests of all Utahns and ensures every voice across the state is represented. We are committed to openness and fairness at every step of the process.”
As Sandall’s House counterpart, legislative leaders have also picked Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, to co-chair the new redistricting committee, according to a news release issued Thursday. 
“Redistricting is a complex and important process and a responsibility that the Legislature takes seriously,” Pierucci said. “Just as we did in 2021, our committee will work thoughtfully, considering the needs of all communities across Utah, while meeting the deadlines and criteria we’ve been given.” 
How to get involved
The new Legislative Redistricting Committee will be holding two public meetings ahead of the Sept. 25 publishing deadline, plus another public comment period on the proposed map leading up to the Legislature’s vote on Oct. 6. 
Here’s the timeline:

Sept. 22: Redistricting Committee public meeting
Sept. 24: Redistricting Committee public meeting
Sept. 25: Legislature publishes proposed map
Sept. 25-Oct. 5: Public comment period on proposed map
Oct. 6: Utah Legislature will hold a special session to vote on the final map and submit it to the court for consideration. 

To view meeting times, agendas and other resources, legislative leaders directed Utahns to visit the Legislature’s website and the 2025 Legislative Redistricting Committee’s website.

(Photo via Getty Images)Another longtime resident of Iowa is suing the federal government for being held in jail without bond pending his potential deportation.
Noel Lopez De La Cruz, 23, of Mt. Pleasant, a noncitizen who has allegedly resided in the United States for more than 20 years since he was a small child, is suing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and others in federal court. The lawsuit challenges what it calls the government’s “new, draconian policy” of reinterpreting the law to eliminate any possibility of bond hearings in immigration-detention cases.
According to court records, De La Cruz first came into contact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on June 9, 2025, at the Muscatine County Jail, where he was held on a warrant charging him with possession of marijuana.

ICE placed a detainer on De La Cruz, and took custody of him on Aug. 16, 2025, when he was released from jail due to the court’s dismissal of the drug-possession charge. De La Cruz is now in the Linn County Jail where he is being held on charges of having entered the United States without authorization and being an immigrant without a valid unexpired immigrant visa.
Court records indicate the Department of Homeland Security has denied him release while his case is pending — an action that is consistent with a new DHS policy that took effect in July 2025. Under that policy, all ICE employees are to consider anyone who is alleged to have entered the United States illegally to be subject to mandatory detention.
De La Cruz requested a bond redetermination hearing before an immigration judge in Omaha Immigration Court, but the judge denied the request finding he had no jurisdiction over the matter given DHS’ new interpretation of federal law.
The lawsuit alleges that as a result of being denied a hearing on the issue, deportation proceedings against De La Cruz cannot be paused and his deportation “will be fast tracked,” further decreasing his chances of arguing against his removal.
In seeking relief from the federal courts, De La Cruz argues that without court intervention, he “faces the prospect of months, or even years, in immigration custody, separated from his family and community.”
A growing number of cases similar to De La Cruz’s lawsuit are being filed around the country, partly because of a Sept. 5, 2025, decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals. In that decision, the board adopted Homeland Security’s new interpretation of the law, finding that immigration judges lack the authority to even consider bond requests in such cases.
‘A gold medal in mental gymnastics’
Attorneys for De La Cruz and others who are facing deportation argue that while federal law does mandate detention for those apprehended on their “arrival” in the United States, a separate section of the law has, for decades, specially allowed for bond hearings in cases where individuals are detained days, months or years after they entered the country.
In De La Cruz’s case, his attorneys argue that to justify detention without bond, the Board of Immigration Appeals has had to stretch the meaning of “arrival” in a manner that is “worthy of a gold medal in mental gymnastics.”
Quoting from prior court rulings, they say this “wild interpretation” of the law “upends decades of administrative interpretation and practice” and would require the detention of literally millions of individuals.
While some immigration judges around the country have continued to grant bond hearings to individuals, Homeland Security has fought back, appealing such decisions. Those appeals typically result in an automatic stay in the proceedings, preventing noncitizens from being released on bond even in cases where a judge has rejected the Trump administration’s new interpretation of the law.
The defendants in the De La Cruz case, who have yet to file a response to the lawsuit, include the Department of Homeland Security and its director, Kristi Noem; U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi; the Executive Office for Immigration Review and its acting director, Srice Owen; the Omaha Immigration Court; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its acting director, Todd M. Lyons; and Peter Berg, a field office director for ICE.
Also named as defendants are Dave Beuter, the chief jail administrator of Linn County Jail, and Brian Gardner, the sheriff of Linn County.
Earlier this week, the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported on another Iowa man, 29-year-old Yeison Antonio Lopez Lopez, who claims he is being held in jail, while facing deportation, without the opportunity to argue for release on bond.
Lopez Lopez is suing the federal government, seeking court intervention to protect “the due process rights owed to thousands of immigration respondents across the country.” That case is still pending.

(Photo courtesy of UWF)University of West Florida trustees narrowed down the criteria for its next president Thursday, as well as how much they might be paid.
Although final contracts are negotiated by the UWF board chair, the Pensacola institution’s next president can expect between $800,000 and $1.2 million in total compensation, its board agreed.
“If you look at the trend for recent hires for total comp[ensation] in Florida at universities, our numbers today are much more in line with the market today,” Zack Smith, trustee and chair of the search committee, said during a board meeting Thursday.
For reference, University of North Florida President Moez Limayem’s pay package is about $560,000, Florida Atlantic University President Adam Hasner’s is about $1.1 million, and Florida A&M University President Marva Johnson’s is about $810,000.

Criteria
According to position criteria compiled by university stakeholders and the search committee, the primary expectations of the president are “servant leadership,” commitment to academic excellence, strategic fundraising and financial stewardship, a “student-centered approach,” community and government relations, and executive experience.
Candidates are preferred to have a relevant graduate degree, although one is not required. 
Heather Riddell, UWF Faculty Senate president and university trustee, proposed an amendment to require the next president to have a graduate degree and optimally a terminal degree, although the board rejected that amendment.
Smith said Funk Associates, the search firm hired by the university, suggested allowing the university to “cast a wide net.”
Requiring a relevant terminal degree — a PhD in most disciplines — may exclude candidates with relevant experience in business, government, and other large organizations.
“At least at this stage, putting it in the presidential search criteria, I think there was some concern that it may exclude otherwise qualified candidates,” Smith said. 
Trustee Adam Kissell said he agreed with casting a “wide net” and Trustee Edward Fleming said he wouldn’t want to exclude someone “who is an incredibly good leader,” such as tech billionaire Elon Musk. 
Former Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. was approved as the school’s interim leader about two weeks after Martha Saunders stepped down in May, before her contract expired.
Diaz, who left his commissioner job that paid about $324,000 for this interim job paying about $750,000, has expressed interest in the permanent job.
The former lawmaker Diaz holds a bachelor’s degree from St. Thomas University and a master’s in educational leadership from Nova Southeastern. He’s previously served as chief operating officer at Doral College, an online school focusing on dual enrollment courses for charter school students.

The desired candidate will have a “record of successful leadership in a complex organization, preferably in higher education, government, or a large nonprofit entity,” according to the criteria decided by the committee.
“Generally, what you see in front of you today is the consensus about the leadership qualities, the experience, and essentially what would be best served for the next president to bring to the table when he’s thinking through whether or not, or when he or she is thinking through whether or not, to come to the university and accept a position,” Smith said. 
Diaz came to the university amid a shakeup on the Board of Trustees, which ended with more than half its membership appointees by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Board of Governors. The changes at UWF could mirror the way New College of Florida has been remade in a more conservative light.
In May, when asked whether the governor played a role in Saunders’ resignation and if DeSantis had any comment, a spokesperson responded: “The governor gave his statement the other day when he said: ‘Buckle up, you’re going to see a lot of changes [at UWF] for the better.’”

What was once one of the country’s largest casino markets is now down to five operating in the area with the closure of its largest casino. The Tunica market has been declining for years, largely from competition in neighboring states and other gambling options becoming available. Harrah’s Tunica, which was previously the largest casino in the market, closed in 2014. 
A majority of Mississippi casinos are now located along the Coast and developers are looking to build more there. Gambling became legal along the Mississippi River and the Coast in 1990. It has since grown to an over $2-billion industry according to the American Gaming Association. Mississippi’s 28 casino properties employ around 37,000 people and provide tax revenue to the state and cities they are in.

Nationally, in-person gambling still brings in more revenue. However, the online gambling sector is rapidly growing. In Mississippi, only in-person or on-site sports betting in a casino is legal despite attempts at legalization of mobile sports betting and studies showing students are finding workarounds to place bets online.
Entergy CEO answers data center questions
We’ve heard from Mississippians recently about their concerns over three large data centers being built in Mississippi.
A major concern is potential electricity rate hikes from the power-hungry centers. Other areas across the country have seen rate increases attributed to data centers.
Last week Mississippi Today sat down for a Q&A with Haley Fisackerly, CEO of Entergy, about the impact of the data centers. He said Mississippi learned lessons from other states before it landed its first data centers, and that they will not cause electric bills to spike in Mississippi. He said rates were already likely to increase in coming years as power companies upgrade antiquated infrastructure, and having large new companies helping foot the bill will lower costs to consumers for new plants.
“First of all, rates were already going up,” Fisackerly said. “The investments were going up. Inflation is driving all of our materials up. Natural gas costs have been higher. Now those are dollar-for-dollar patch throughs that we don’t make profits off of. But that trajectory we were showing is being lowered. So there’s still going to be rates going up.  Everybody’s rates are going up. 
“… Rates are not going to be as high as they otherwise would’ve been.”

(LRC Public Information)Louisville Republican Rep. Jason Nemes wants Kentucky’s legislature to prohibit the sale and distribution of parts that convert semiautomatic firearms to fully automatic, known as machine gun conversion devices. 
However, two GOP lawmakers on a committee that heard the bill Thursday voiced opposition, saying the proposal would limit Kentuckians’ Second Amendment rights. 
Nemes, the House Republican whip, told lawmakers on the Joint Committee on Judiciary that the idea mirrors an existing prohibition in federal law and was brought to him by Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and Louisville Police Chief Paul Humphrey and citizens. 
“Why is that important? Because right now we’re not allowed to enforce federal law, obviously, with the state. So we need a state law,” Nemes said, adding that more than two dozen other states have similar laws banning such devices, often called “switches” or “auto sears.” 
One of those states is Alabama. Two Alabama state representatives, Republican Russell Bedsole and Democrat Phillip Ensler, teleconferenced in to speak in support of the legislation and how it impacted Alabama. 
Bedsole underscored that during debates, Alabama Republicans became supportive of the measure after believing it “really has nothing at all to do with the Second Amendment.” 
Louisville Police Chief Paul Humphrey speaks during a press conference. (Screenshot)
“The bottom line is this: In no way does this legislation impact the Second Amendment,” he said. “What it does is allows our state and local prosecutors to enforce the law without having to rely on our federal counterparts.” 
Earlier this summer, 16 states sued the Trump administration to block redistribution of thousands of machine gun conversion devices. Most of them also had state laws banning such devices. The Trump administration has agreed to return 12,000 seized devices as part of a settlement with the gun industry and gun rights groups.
According to a draft of Nemes’ bill, a person would be guilty of possessing a machine gun conversion device under state law if “he or she possesses, obtains, receives, sells, or uses a part or combination of parts designed and intended to convert a firearm into a machine gun.” It would be a Class C felony, which could result in five to 10 years in prison. 
Humphrey, who became the permanent Louisville police chief a year ago, appeared with Nemes Thursday. The chief added that the devices make “the weapon far less accurate and far more dangerous to everyone around.” He said the Louisville Metro Police Department seized 26 conversion devices in 2023. The following year, LMPD seized 58. 
Louisville is Kentucky’s largest city. 
Humphrey said his officers cannot enforce federal law. In situations where someone is arrested for a crime that doesn’t involve a firearm, but officers find these devices, “there is nothing we can do other than give that back to them,” he explained. 
“The only hope that we have of any type of enforcement of this type of weapon is to be dependent on the federal government, particularly the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives), to not only pick up the case, but go forward with the prosecution,” the police chief said. 
Rep. Savannah Maddox speaks on the House floor. (LRC Public Information)
The proposal generated a lot of back and forth between Republicans, who have the supermajority in the state legislature. Lawmakers seen as Liberty Republicans, Reps. T.J. Roberts and Savannah Maddox, expressed concerns about the addition of a state law when a federal one is on the books. 
“I think we’ve sorely missed out on opportunities to ensure that the Second Amendment is not a second class right,” Roberts said. “I think our energy is better spent actually expanding this right to self defense, rather than imposing further restrictions that are already illegal at the federal level. 
Maddox said the bill should give those “in support of the Second Amendment” some pause as it would create a new regulation in state law. 
“I appreciate where you’re coming from on this, and I appreciate the detailed research that you have put into this to create your argument, but just at the most simplistic, bare bones minimum level, I view this as new and additional gun control, and I have some issues with it,” she said. “I’m opposed to it.” 
Nemes argued his bill would “not be new gun control” because it would not impose a new prohibition on citizens because it is currently illegal for Kentuckians to have these devices. 
“It is illegal today. This doesn’t change that. So, to say that it puts another restriction that is factually incorrect,” Nemes said. 
The bill did get some support from a Democrat on the committee. Sen. Reggie Thomas of Lexington, the Senate minority caucus chair, called it a “common sense approach” to keep police officers and the public out of harm’s way. 
“To me, this has nothing to do with the Second Amendment,” Thomas said. “No one’s trying to eviscerate the Second Amendment, but every legislation that we deal with has to come from a consensus. Is it good for the public? Is it going to help the public in some way? And most importantly, as lawmakers, our number one responsibility is to make sure the public is safe.” 
The committee also received a letter from gun manufacturer Glock in support of the legislation.

The battle played out as Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson – seeking the Democratic nomination in the August primary – and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Democrat running for the same office as an independent – both released notices that they gained support from the Teamsters.
But Duggan’s campaign had to scale back its initial announcement to clarify that it had just one of a few Teamsters’ support, as opposed to the several announced in a Tuesday news release.

The council’s president, Kevin Moore, said Duggan received the support because the union is seeing real progress in Detroit thanks to the mayor’s influence and time in office.
“Here in America, neither party wants to work together, but I know one guy that will: Mike Duggan,” Moore said in a statement released by the campaign. “Mike Duggan will work with any party or no party to get work done. He wants to work for every single person in Michigan – and you can count on it. He has values and trust in his word. Mike Duggan has an honor code, and he will work great with labor and business. He’s going to change the dynamics of Michigan.”
The Teamsters Joint Council 43 has never endorsed an independent candidate for governor, the release said; it endorsed current Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2018 and in 2022.
Duggan took the endorsement as a major honor.
“Teamsters built Michigan, and rebuilt Detroit. They’re hard workers who know who to trust, and I am proud to have earned their endorsement,” Duggan said. “The strength of this endorsement cannot be understated: this represents the backbone of our state. When I am elected governor, I will proudly work with the Teamsters and labor, as well as business and end the dysfunction in Lansing and move Michigan forward.”
A few hours later, the Duggan campaign updated the release. The campaign noted that the release incorrectly indicated that the endorsement was on behalf of its 10 local affiliated unions, which was untrue.
By Wednesday, Benson clapped back with a Teamsters endorsement of her own. In a news release, her campaign said that one half of the 10 affiliated Teamsters union local outfits were supporting her bid. That includes Teamsters Locals 406, 243, 283, 1038 and 247.
The unions backing Benson represent nurses, truck drivers, package deliverers, public employees.
She thanked them each for their support on Wednesday.
“This campaign is, and always has been, about the people. It’s about making sure the people who power our state’s economy and have built their families here, can afford to live in Michigan and thrive,” Benson said. “Where you have access to high-paying jobs, can afford to raise your family, buy a home, and retire with dignity. And where you always have a seat at the table in a Benson administration.”
Teamsters Local 1038 President Greg Nowak said in a statement that his local wasn’t “messing around with the anti-worker, corporate-owned mayor of Detroit.”
“We’re standing with Jocelyn Benson,” Nowack said. “She’s not backed by billionaires or dark money lobbyists like those who are backing her opponents, she’s backed by truck drivers, nurses, mechanics, teachers, warehouse workers, and first responders – the people who clock in every day and hold this state together. We’re the engine behind Michigan’s economy, and it’s about damn time we had someone in the governor’s office who understands that.”
Scott Quenneville, president of the Teamsters Local 243, said Benson was listening to nurses, drivers, warehouse workers and “everyone in between.”
“She’s not bought. She’s not sold,” Quenneville said. “And she sure as hell isn’t afraid to fight for working families. That’s why Teamsters Local 243 is proud to stand with her – because she’s always stood with us.”
Benson has also racked up numerous other nods from unions across Michigan, making the chunk of Teamsters affiliates a powerful grab.
Still, Duggan keeps swinging with union endorsements following the back and forth.
The Detroit Local 636 Pipefitters issued their endorsement of Duggan on Wednesday afternoon, and the American Postal Workers Union Local 480 and 481 issued their support for the mayor on Thursday afternoon.
“Our members have recognized the many accomplishments while serving as mayor of the city of Detroit,” said Steve Wood, president of APWU Local 480-481, in a statement. “This includes lowering Detroit’s crime rate to the lowest in 50 years, bringing the city out of bankruptcy, and for the first time in 60 years, the city population is growing. We look forward to seeing what Mike Duggan has planned for the future of the great State of Michigan.”

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer) Eight people have been charged with wire fraud for collectively billing Medicaid about $8 million for services they allegedly did not provide in what a federal prosecutor called a massive “fraud scheme” related to the state’s defunct housing stabilization program.
This is only the first wave of charges, said Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson at a press conference Thursday.
Minnesota became the first state in 2020 to leverage Medicaid dollars to help older adults and people with disabilities find and maintain housing, but the program is “riddled with fraud,” Thompson said. Program costs have ballooned suspiciously since its inception, and “most of it is fraud, as far as I can tell,” Thompson said.
Analysts predicted the program would cost about $2.6 million annually. But in 2021, the program paid out over $21 million in claims. It then ballooned to $42 million in 2022, $74 million in 2023 and $104 million in 2024, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
In the first six months of 2025, the program paid out another $61 million.
The latest charges are another instance of the alleged defrauding of a Minnesota public program, joining the looting of a pandemic-era food aid program and the state’s autism program.
“Minnesota is drowning in fraud,” Thompson said.
The federal charges were leveled against: Moktar Hassan Aden, 30, Mustafa Dayib Ali, 29, Khalid Ahmed Dayib, 26, Abdifitah Mohamud Mohamed, 27, Christopher Adesoji Falade, 62, Emmanuel Oluwademilade Falade, 32, Asad Ahmed Adow, 26, and Anwar Ahmed Adow, 25.
Thompson said the defendants targeted vulnerable people, many of whom were being released from drug or alcohol rehab facilities, and signed them up to purportedly help them find stable housing.
“Most of these individuals did not receive the stable housing they so desperately needed. The money was simply stolen,” Thompson said.
Many of the Housing Stabilization Services providers also had one or more companies billing other Medicaid programs, like the Early Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Intervention Program operated through autism treatment providers. As the Reformer first reported in 2024, the feds are investigating that program, too.
“The level of fraud in these programs is staggering. Unfortunately, our system of trust but verify no longer works. These programs have been abused over and over to the point where the fraud has overtaken the legitimate services,” Thompson said.
The Department of Human Services, which administers the Housing Stabilization Services program, said in a statement that the agency has been collaborating with law enforcement to root out fraud. 
“Let today’s actions serve as a warning to anyone who steals from Minnesota taxpayers: You will be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible by our law enforcement partners,” said Shireen Gandhi, temporary DHS commissioner, in a statement.
One of the largest Housing Stabilization Services providers was Brilliant Minds Services LLC, with which four of the defendants — Aden, Ali, Dayib and Mohamed — were affiliated. It was housed at the Griggs-Midway building in St. Paul, which also has over 20 businesses connected to the Housing Stabilization Services program.
According to court documents, from 2020 to 2024, Brilliant Minds Services claimed to serve 350 people and billed the program $2.3 million. But the company only provided a fraction of their claimed services, prosecutors allege.
From April 2023 to May 2025, each of the four defendants affiliated with Brilliant Minds Services personally pocketed between $300,000 to $400,000, according to court documents.
DHS in its statement said it stopped payments to Brilliant Minds in May, the same month KARE 11 first reported about the suspected fraud.
Thompson said he will bring more charges in the coming weeks and months, but he said the state must do more at the front end to stop fraud.
“The state and its politicians are starting to take notice about the problem. It’s time for everyone to speak up and stand up to confront the problem before it’s too late,” Thompson said.
The widespread fraud is expected to be a major Republican talking point during the 2026 election, especially as Gov. Tim Walz seeks a third term.
Just hours before a Minnesota House panel examining fraud in public programs was to meet Wednesday, Walz put out a fresh plan.
The Walz administration moved to shutter the housing program last month, following FBI search warrant raids in July.
And, the assistant commissioner of the Department of Human Services who oversaw the housing program was apparently fired before he could testify to the House committee Wednesday.

(Photo by Graycen Wheeler/KOSU)OKLAHOMA CITY — The president of an Oklahoma group that has advocated to reduce cockfighting penalties has been charged with allegedly watching one.
Anthony Wayne Headrick DeVore, 52, of Caddo, was charged last week in McIntosh County with spectating a cockfight after authorities allege he attended a fight on June 7, according to court records. He pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor offense. 
DeVore, who has led the Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission political action committee, has pleaded not guilty. His next court date is set for Nov. 7.
DeVore’s attorney, Billy Coyle, said Thursday that he has an issue with the way the case has been handled. He said DeVore was never questioned by police during the investigation. 
“There’s a fine line between trampling the Constitution and individual rights and protecting animals through hidden investigative techniques,” Coyle said.
He said DeVore maintains his innocence. 
Video evidence taken by an “undercover reporting party” showed DeVore attending a cockfight in McIntosh County, an investigator with the Cherokee Nation’s Marshal Service wrote in an arrest warrant affidavit released by the McIntosh County Clerk’s Office. 
The same video also showed roosters in a pit and dead roosters “piled in a trailer,” according to the affidavit. 
As head of the Gamefowl Commission, DeVore has been an outspoken advocate at the Capitol for reducing criminal penalties for participating in cockfighting. Cockfighting is the practice of forcing two roosters to fight each other, often to the death, for entertainment and regularly includes gambling on outcomes of the fights. 
DeVore said previously that the Gamefowl Commission, which at one time had around 15,000 members, was created to combat false stereotypes that gamefowl farmers were raising roosters to fight.
Voters in 2002 approved a ballot measure criminalizing participating in and watching cockfighting. 
DeVore could face up to a year in county jail or a fine of up to $500 if convicted. 
In an unrelated matter, the state Ethics Commission announced Wednesday that it had settled with the Gamefowl Commission. As part of the settlement, the group admitted to several violations of state laws on financial contributions to political action committees. The group must dissolve within 30 days, pay a $10,000 fine and is barred from reforming for the next two years, according to the settlement.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)TOPEKA — Drug-soaked paper was smuggled into at least one Kansas prison, according to state officials, who cited the ordeal as the reason for changing print newspaper subscription policies.
In late August, the Kansas Department of Corrections suddenly canceled subscriptions purchased by outside parties for those in state custody, confounding newspaper publishers across the state. Officials cited “dangerous contraband” and a need to preserve safety but did not go into specifics
David Thompson, a spokesman for the agency that oversees state prisons, disclosed the drug-soaked newsprint after a Kansas Reflector story published on Sept. 8.
“The impetus for this policy is an increase in drug-soaked material, such as books and newspapers, being transmitted to residents through the USPS,” he wrote in a Sept. 9 email.
When reached by phone Wednesday, he refused to confirm any criminal investigation into the alleged distribution and possession of drug-soaked newspapers.
In an earlier email, he wrote that the agency was “not able to provide additional information because doing so could jeopardize the safety of our employees, residents, and facilities, and negatively impact ongoing investigations. However, the challenge of drug-laced paper in correctional facilities is not isolated to Kansas. This is a challenge in both federal and state facilities across the country.”
In documented reports of drug-laced paper products mailed into prisons across the United States and abroad, officials detail criminal enterprises involving soaking or spraying paper, often in strips, in a liquid containing synthetic drugs. 
In those reports, the drug-laced paper is often appended to books, pamphlets or legal mail. Legal mail is usually confidential and cannot be inspected by prison officials. Kansas Reflector could not identify any other recorded examples of newspapers used as a means for transporting drug-infused paper strips.
Once inside the prison, incarcerated individuals typically smoke the strips or eat them, creating serious health risks.
The corrections department implemented its new policy on Aug. 27, requiring incarcerated individuals to buy a print subscription themselves. Digital subscriptions were unaffected. Without notice to newspaper publishers, many were confused by the subscription cancellations that rolled into newsrooms following the change.
Emily Bradbury, the executive director of the Kansas Press Association, said concerns remain for Kansas newspaper publishers and media professionals. She has heard from more publishers across the state who have seen canceled subscriptions following the policy change.
Bradbury said it’s not an issue she wants “swept under the rug,” but she said she hopes for a solution once she can meet with corrections officials. She said that it is in the interest of publishers to have newspapers reaching the communities they cover.
“It’s also in our best interest as an industry to have an engaged and informed citizenry,” Bradbury said, “and that includes those living in correctional facilities.”
In response to the influx of drugs smuggled into prisons by mail, some corrections agencies, including Kansas’, have taken steps to digitize or screen mail before it reaches incarcerated individuals.
New Jersey prison officials have struggled to combat the flow of mail soaked or sprayed with K2, a synthetic cannabinoid also called spice, according to reporting from the New Jersey Monitor, a States Newsroom outlet. Now, mail is sent to a facility in Las Vegas for review before being photocopied, put in an envelope and delivered to the intended recipient, according to New Jersey Department of Corrections policy. But the method has sparked privacy concerns.
Privileged legal correspondence, books, magazines, publications with a spine and newspapers are sent directly from a publisher to New Jersey inmates, the policy said. The same is now required in Kansas.
All other mail, except privileged legal correspondence, delivered to Kansas prisons is inspected, withheld and photocopied before reaching designated incarcerated individuals, according to agency policy.
The Criminal Justice Testing and Evaluation, a research-based program within the National Institute of Justice, found in a 2021 report that digitized personal mail could be an effective way to stem the flow of drugs into prisons.
“While a digitized incoming inmate mail solution can eliminate vulnerabilities associated with traditional mail, it is not a panacea,” the report said. “The demand for drugs is not altered, and inmates and their conspirators will seek to exploit other contraband pathways (e.g., visitors, staff, drones, throw-overs).”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-147955774-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 15:58:46.165158

(Courtesy of Niobrara Council)(Courtesy of Niobrara Council)LINCOLN — A Friday interim study hearing on whether the State of Nebraska should takeover management of the scenic Niobrara River from the National Park Service has been canceled due to a family matter involving the senator who requested the study.
It was not immediately clear whether the hearing, sponsored by State Sen. Tonya Storer of Whitman, would be rescheduled prior to the 2026 session of the Nebraska Legislature.
Another interim study scheduled Friday before the Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee also was withdrawn. That hearing, sponsored by Lincoln Sen. George Duggan, was to investigate the need for a “Green Amendment.”
Currently, the National Parks Service manages the Niobrara, which was federally designated in 1991 as a wild and scenic river worthy of protection. The Park Service operates that section of river with an annual budget of $1.2 million and had been providing $100,000 each year to the Niobrara Council, a committee of local officials who provide input and some management help.
Storer has said the uncertainty of future federal funding for river management warranted the study of a state takeover, but Niobrara advocates have expressed doubts that the state has the money or expertise to maintain the river’s scenic qualities.

But hundreds of Guatemalan children would have been removed if not for the temporary restraining order.600 children identified for removalAttorneys from the The National Immigration Law Center, which brought the suit, tried to include the class certification to also apply to children from Honduras, but Kelly narrowed the class to only apply to children from Guatemala. The Trump administration has identified up to 600 Guatemalan children in the Office of Refugee Resettlement custody and foster care to be removed, according to the court filings. Separately, a federal judge in Arizona issued a temporary restraining order until Sept. 26 to bar the Trump administration from removing Honduran and Guatemalan children in federal custody and foster care from being removed from the United States.The National Immigration Law Center’s Efrén C. Olivares, lead attorney on the District of Columbia case, said in a statement that it’s a relief that “hundreds of children … are now safe from the Trump administration’s unlawful attempt to expel them from the United States.” “This decision should send a clear message to the administration that they have no legal authority to circumvent the law to expel unaccompanied children without due process,” he said.A DOJ record ‘barren of evidence’Kelly criticized the Trump administration for its claim that the parents of the Guatemalan children had requested they be returned to their home country. “In any event, the record here is barren of evidence that any child in the proposed class wants to return to Guatemala, even if their parents can be found,” he wrote.He added that such a move violated the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008.“While Defendants plunged ahead in the middle of the night with their “reunification” plan and then represented to a judge that a parent or guardian had requested each child’s return, that turned out not to be true,” Kelly wrote. “Such a rushed, seemingly error-laden operation to send unaccompanied alien children back to their home countries is one of the things that the TVPRA’s process prevents.”In court declarations, many of the parents said they were unaware their children were being returned. One parent, referred to as B.M.R.P., asked for her daughter to remain in the U.S. for her safety.“I think she is in danger if she does return to Guatemala,” B.M.R.P. said. “All I ask is that you help my daughter stay safe – help her stay safe by not returning her to Guatemala.”Attorneys for the children argued that if they were returned to Guatemala, they could face violence and the Trump administration's move to deport them violated immigration procedures for unaccompanied minors. Congress has carved out special legal protections for immigrant children, such as the 2008 TVPRA law that requires minors be placed in immigration proceedings and have access to legal counsel.",,,,2025-09-18 15:58:46.165158

ACA enhanced tax credits were introduced in 2021 as part of the COVID-19 stimulus package and are set to expire at the end of 2025. The enhanced credits give more money to a wider range of households to pay for ACA marketplace plans compared to ACA’s baseline premium tax credits. According to estimates by KFF, a health policy organization, letting them expire would result in an increase of 75% in premiums for those enrolled through ACA marketplaces.
Unless Congress votes to extend the tax credits, 89,000 Minnesotans will see an average increase of $177 per month, raising the average premium from $326 to $503, according to MNsure.
Nearly 20,000 Minnesotans will lose all financial help in paying for healthcare.
Democrats in Congress are using their leverage in a government funding deadline at the end of the month to try to demand health care concessions from Republicans. Republicans put forth a stopgap plan Tuesday to keep the government funded at least until Nov. 21, pushing off an impending government shutdown if Congress fails to pass funding by October. On Wednesday, Democrats responded with their own plan, which includes an extension on the ACA enhanced tax credits.
Senate passage of most bills requires 60 votes, which means the 53-seat Republican majority will need at least seven Democrats to support appropriations bills to avert a shutdown after September 30.

Republicans are beginning to recognize the political risk of letting the enhanced credits expire before midterm elections. Ten House Republicans previously launched a bipartisan bill to extend the tax credits by one year. The House Ways and Means Republicans had a “tense” lunch last week over whether to extend the credits, Politico reported. The Republicans’ stopgap funding bill made no mention of ACA tax credits, though.
In addition to extending ACA enhanced premium tax credits, the Democrats’ funding proposal would reverse every health care provision in the GOP megalaw, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which the Congressional Budget Office estimated will reduce federal spending on health care by over $1 trillion at the expense of 10 million Americans losing health insurance.
The GOP spending law’s health care provisions are wide in scope and cut funding from Medicaid, ACA marketplaces and Medicare. For example, it introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a policy that has resulted in confusion and unnecessary loss of insurance in Georgia and Arkansas, the two states that currently have Medicaid work requirements.
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who was one of three Republican senators who voted against the megabill, said that she predicts Republicans will also be under “tremendous pressure” to change the GOP spending law as the implications on Medicaid and rural healthcare become clearer, Politico reported.
U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison, a Democrat and physician who represents the west metro, said that she “hopes that there are Republicans who will come to their senses and defend their constituents” when it comes to extending the ACA tax credits and reversing health care cuts.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tammybaldwinsept162025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-18 15:58:46.165158

The collaborative was announced by Maine officials as the federal vaccine advisory group, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), is meeting Thursday and Friday at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. ACIP provides guidance to the CDC director on how vaccines should be used, and can determine the future of common vaccines such as the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, the Hepatitis B vaccine, or COVID-19 booster shots.
Historically, almost all U.S. states have accepted immunization guidance from the CDC. The move effectively allows the partner states to issue alternative guidance, amid concerns that ACIP has been politicized. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed several panelists who question the safety of long-established and evidence-based vaccines, instead making statements critical of current vaccine policy.
On Wednesday, a similar alliance among West Coast states formally recommended that all adults and children concerned about the respiratory illness season can receive the COVID-19 vaccine and other common inoculations like the flu vaccine, in rebuke of the federal advisory committee. 
The northeast collaborative has yet to issue a recommendation, though members have formed working groups to identify opportunities for collaboration in areas including public health emergency preparedness and response, vaccine recommendations and purchasing, data collection and analysis, infectious disease, epidemiology, and laboratory capacity and services.
Earlier this month, Mills announced a directive to the Maine CDC to allow everyone to access the 2025-26 COVID-19 shot without a prescription, going against federal guidance.
This fall, the Food and Drug Administration only approved the shots for those at greatest risk for getting seriously ill from COVID, including seniors at least 65 years old or those who have health conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, or high blood pressure. 
But under Maine’s standing order — which Mills said “serves as a prescription for all Maine people” — everyone can once again get the vaccine at pharmacies, clinics, and health care offices across the state without a prescription from their health care provider.

(Photo courtesy of Rhode Island FC)Pawtucket’s Centreville Bank Stadium will host the University of Rhode Island (URI)’s Rhode Island Rams for their 2026 football season while the Division I team’s home turf in Kingston undergoes significant renovations, the school announced Wednesday. 
The Rams’ preliminary outing at Centreville is on Oct. 3, when the Brown Bears will host them for the Governor’s Cup — the first football game to be held at the stadium. The Rams’ home games will then continue for the 2025 season through November at Meade Stadium. In January, the stadium will embark on the most extensive portions of a $42 million renovation project that will take approximately 18 months to complete.   
The Rams’ use of Centreville was brokered by URI Vice President and Director of Athletics Thorr Bjorn and Centreville Bank Stadium General Manager Paul Byrne.  
“We are thrilled to partner with Centreville Bank Stadium to be our home next season,” Bjorn said in a statement Wednesday. “Not only will we be able to play in a state-of-the-art first-class facility, but it will be a chance to showcase our nationally-ranked program to our alumni and fans in a different part of the state.”
The temporary home does have a price tag attached: Bjorn told the university’s Board of Trustees in a Thursday meeting of its Student Life and Athletics Committee that “the price is about $50,000 per game, give or take, with expenses and rent” to play at Centreville Stadium. 
There are 12 games in a regular season. The Rams will play five home games in the 2025 season. Game dates for the Rams’ 2026 season are forthcoming.

“We’re in a really good place to do that,” Bjorn told the trustees. “We’re also hoping that maybe that can help us attract a new fan base.”
Meade underwent smaller renovations funded by private donations in 2024, including a $1 million video board and a $4.1 million installation of new artificial turf and lighting. Roughly $42 million of the $65.8 million allocated in 2024 state budget to improve URI’s athletics facilities will go toward Meade, which is also used by the women’s lacrosse team. The renovation includes the demolition and replacement of the east stands.
“It’s about 5,000 seats, 800 chairbacks, brand new press box,” Bjorn told the trustees. “It’s just really going to be another game changer. You know, the turf and lights were huge. The scoreboard was amazing.”
Both Meade and Centreville’s playing surface are carpeted with FieldTurf, a blend of various plastics, silica sand, and rubber meant to closely simulate real blades of grass. The material is used at numerous NFL stadiums, including Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. A recent press release from Tarkett, FieldTurf’s France-based manufacturer, boasts the product as “virtually mirroring” the qualities of Kentucky bluegrass, a species used as a model for artificial turf design.
 The 10,500-seat Centreville Bank Stadium and its high-end turf is one fruit of the ongoing Tidewater Landing redevelopment, a $132 million project that features $50 million in public subsidies and tax incentives, plus interest. The city and state will need to start paying back the debt for the soccer stadium in fiscal year 2027, relying on revenue generated by the project. Other elements of the multi-use development, such as housing and commercial space, are still in the planning stages.
Centreville opened in May as the home of Rhode Island FC, the Ocean State’s first professional soccer club. The stadium sits alongside the Pawtucket River and is billed as an all-electric venue usable for multiple sports.

Patrick Morrisey announced on Thursday, Sept. 18, 2025, that he is asking for West Virginians’ input on the state’s application for the federal Rural Health Transformation Program. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey is asking for public input on West Virginia’s application for millions of dollars in federal funding meant to target rural health. 
The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services opened the application process for the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program on Monday. The program is a provision of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or HR 1, which made historic cuts and changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Health Insurance Marketplace.
The law, which President Donald Trump signed in July, is expected to cut federal Medicaid spending by nearly $911 billion over 10 years and result in 10 million people losing health insurance by 2034, according to KFF.  
Congress included the rural health transformation fund in the bill in response to the threat of rural hospitals closing because of the cuts. 
According to U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, the $50 billion fund will be distributed to approved states over the next five years, with $10 billion will be distributed each year starting in fiscal year 2026. 
Half of the money will be distributed evenly to states with approved applications. The other half will be distributed based on states’ individual metrics and applications that “reflect the greatest potential for and scale of impact on the health of rural communities.”
“This program is a historic investment that will catalyze needed change in rural health systems and improve lives for generations to come,” CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a news release. “For too long, when it comes to health care access and infrastructure, we’ve left behind the backbone of America. That stops now with this program that will spark real change for rural health care.”
During a news conference Thursday, Morrisey said the program “provides an unbelievable opportunity for West Virginia to, as I’m fond of saying, move the needle on things that really matter to help our state.”
The state could receive $100 million per year from the fund over the next five years, the governor said. 
“We have a chance to help our citizens live longer, healthier lives… We have an opportunity to reverse some of the terrible health trends that we’ve seen that have plagued our state for a long time,” Morrisey said. “I think the key to our application is to really go in and focus on things that we can meaningfully improve.”
Morrisey said his administration is hoping to hear ideas for the state’s application from “all of the constituencies out there.”
“If you’re a company and you care, and you have different ideas, we want to meet with you,” he said. “If you’re a trade association. We want to meet with you. If you’re part of the general public and have good ideas, we want to meet with you. 
“We always are a believer in having that transparency and getting the good ideas and leveraging that to submit the best application, and one I think that can help bring everyone together,” he said. 
According to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, the Republican megabill, once fully implemented, will result in $1 billion less per year in federal health care funding to West Virginia. Some hospitals will close their doors or reduce services, according to the WVCBP.
In a statement Thursday, Ellen Allen, executive director of West Virginians for Affordable Health Care, which opposed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, said they expected and are pleased that West Virginia is applying for the funding. With the “devastating”  $1.1 trillion health care cuts, the funding will provide at least short term support for struggling hospitals operating with thin margins, she said. 
“But we must be clear eyed: the funds from the Rural Health Transformation fund will account for less than 37% of cuts to Medicaid and the provider tax that funds rural hospitals,” Allen said.
States’ applications are due to the federal government by Nov. 5. The federal government is expected to decide awards by the end of the year. 
Because of the tight deadline, Morrisey asked that any ideas from the public be submitted to RHTP@wv.gov by Sept. 29.  More information is available under the Rural Health Transformation Program tab at https://governor.wv.gov.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)State lawmakers from across the country are asking the Trump administration to stop its review of state laws it says are overly burdensome on businesses.
Earlier this week, the National Conference of State Legislatures wrote to federal leaders, citing bipartisan concern about recent federal actions that, in its view, attempt to undermine the authority of state governments.
“Our members have raised concerns that the federal government does not pay close enough attention to the state impact of their decisions. State laws and regulations are foundational to America’s economic and social infrastructure,” the organization wrote.
The National Conference of State Legislatures, which represents state legislatures and legislative staff across the country, was responding to an August 15 announcement from the Justice Department and the National Economic Council that they would be seeking to identify state laws that “significantly and adversely affect the national economy or interstate economic activity.”
In soliciting public comment, the Trump administration referenced the possibility of using existing federal authority or new legislation to preempt state regulations.










State laws and regulations are foundational to America’s economic and social infrastructure.


– The National Conference of State Legislatures


The Justice Department announcement of the review cited an ongoing feud over state animal welfare standards. In recent years, major agricultural industry players and congressional Republicans have taken aim at efforts such as California’s Proposition 12, which requires farms to meet certain standards to provide animals freedom of movement, including cage-free enclosures and minimum floor space.
California’s voter initiative also bars retailers from selling animal products raised in other states that don’t meet California’s standards — viewed as a major imposition by agriculture interests across the country.
In July, the Trump administration sued California, arguing its regulations were driving up the cost of eggs across the country because of the state’s outsize role in the national economy.
“It is one thing if California passes laws that affect its own State, it is another when those laws affect other States in violation of the U.S. Constitution,” U.S. Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a statement at the time.
In its response to the administration’ recent solicitation, NCSL noted that the Supreme Court in 2023 upheld California’s Proposition 12.
State lawmakers reconsider costs, purpose of serving after Minnesota assassination

NCSL said the Justice Department review would contravene the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says powers not specifically delegated to the federal government or prohibited by the Constitution are reserved for states.
The organization of state lawmakers argues that the foundational concept of federalism allows states to enact regulations and laws that are more responsive and adaptable to local citizens.
“NCSL urges the Department of Justice to withdraw this unprecedented and broad attempt to undermine state authority,” the organization wrote.
The letter was signed by four NCSL officers — two Democratic and two Republican state lawmakers.

The University of Vermont Health Network announced Wednesday that it is now working with Dartmouth Health to provide more seamless access to kidney transplant surgery, which it shuttered in-house earlier this year.
Patients who require a kidney transplant also need significant pre-operative and post-operative care, and the latter can often last years. After the University of Vermont Medical Center stopped providing transplants on March 1, patients in need of the surgery had to seek the full continuum of care outside the network, meaning they needed to drive out of state for each pre- and post-surgery consultation. 
The new collaboration with Dartmouth Health means that patients can now receive their pre- and post-surgery care in UVM Medical Center’s Burlington clinics, working with both Dartmouth and UVM physicians, according to UVM Health Network spokesperson Annie Mackin. The transplant surgeries themselves will take place at Dartmouth’s Lebanon, New Hampshire, hospital.
Before it ended the service, the medical center performed roughly 12 kidney transplants each year, said Mackin, a volume that was not enough to cover the costs. The low number of transplants at UVM Medical Center was noted in a health care report commissioned by the state from the consulting firm Oliver Wyman released last year. The report recommended consolidating kidney transplant surgeries in higher volume areas, as one among many ways to make healthcare more efficient and less expensive in the state.
The health network —- which includes three Vermont hospitals and three hospitals in New York — announced its decision to end the local surgeries in November 2024. At the same time, it also announced its intention to transfer management of three dialysis centers, which the medical center ran out of hospitals in Newport, Rutland and St. Albans, to those hospitals. However, UVM Medical Center ultimately continued to manage the dialysis services out of these three different regional hospitals because they were unable to take over the costs of services, Mackin said.   
As part of the same announcement to scale back services last November, the hospital proposed closing two other clinics associated with Central Vermont Medical Center. Network leadership cited the limits set by the Green Mountain Care Board last September for fiscal year 2025 on how much revenue the hospital can collect each year. One of the clinics, Mad River Valley Health Center in Waitsfield, is scheduled to close Sept. 26, with patients being transferred to the hospital’s family medicine practice in Waterbury.
The annual regulatory review of hospital budgets, recently completed for 2026, is intended to keep healthcare costs in check for patients and insurers. When cuts were announced, care board chair Owen Foster resisted taking the blame, explaining that the network could have cut a number of other costs before cutting health care services.

(West Virginia First Foundation photo)West Virginia First Foundation chair Matt Harvey announced Thursday that he will be resigning from the organization’s board as he awaits confirmation to a federal post.
In July, Harvey was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of West Virginia. While he has yet to be confirmed by Congress, Harvey said Thursday that stepping down from the First Foundation is a requirement for his potential new appointment.
Harvey, who works as the Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney, has headed the First Foundation’s board of directors since its inception in November of 2023. He announced his departure during the private nonprofit’s quarterly meeting on Thursday.
Members of the First Foundation board voted Thursday for Greg Duckworth, a former state trooper and current Raleigh County Commissioner, to serve as interim board chair until the organization’s next regularly scheduled board election at the end of this year.
Duckworth was appointed to the First Foundation board along with Harvey by former Gov. Jim Justice in August 2023. Duckworth worked as a West Virginia State Trooper for 26 years and retired in 2016, according to the Herald Dispatch. He was elected as a Raleigh County commissioner in 2020. 
Harvey said serving on the First Foundation board the last few years has been “the honor of his life.” He said he plans to still follow the work done by the First Foundation and will likely work alongside the organization in the future.
Also Thursday, members of the board discussed a new grant cycle, the Momentum Initiative Grants, opening next week. The organization is making $19.2 million in grants available for organizations and individuals to apply to for programming and initiatives to help confront the state’s ongoing drug and overdose epidemic.
This grant cycle, the First Foundation is accepting applications for programming targeted toward: 

Foster care and non-parental caregivers statewide ($3.9 million available)
Youth drug and addiction prevention services ($4 million)
Recovery housing projects ($3.8 million)
Behavioral health and workforce development initiatives ($3.75 million)
Day report and reentry programs ($3.75 million)

More information on the grant cycle can be found at https://wvfirst.org/mig/. Applications can be filed for the grants starting Monday, Sept. 22. The application window will close on Oct. 10.

It marks the second time since July that the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation has announced plans to close The Lookout Kitchen restaurants at Beavers Bend, Lake Murray, Robbers Cave, Roman Nose and Quartz Mountain state parks.
State parks officials on Thursday would not say why the restaurants were closing Sept. 30. A spokesperson referred Oklahoma Voice to a statement the agency put out that says the Department of Tourism and Recreation plans to begin searching for a new restaurant vendor in the coming weeks and wants to reopen the restaurants as soon as possible.
In the interim, the agency will provide “grab-and-go food options and catering lists to ensure food remains available for park visitors and event guests,” officials said.
An attorney for The Lookout Kitchen did not immediately return a message left seeking comment Monday.
The state parks department closed the restaurants in July following a contract dispute over money owed by the vendor who operates them. The restaurants reopened several days later after the vendor agreed to pay past due monthly payments totaling more than $274,000, officials said.
Records obtained by Oklahoma Voice through an Open Records request showed that prior to the first closure, the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation made numerous attempts to collect the money The Lookout Kitchen owed the state. 
In addition, records show several instances where the state repeatedly sought documents the restaurant was required to supply under its contract.
A sixth restaurant, which had been operated by The Lookout Kitchen located at Sequoyah State Park, was still closed months after a Dec. 12 fire that also damaged the lodge.
In July, the owner of The Lookout Kitchen, JP Wilson, said the restaurant was insured. But though the damage was minimal, he said he was forced to close the location, and was still waiting on the state to reopen it.

Free.,"DACA recipients swept up in Trump mass deportation campaign, advocates report",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/daca-recipients-swept-trump-mass-deportation-campaign-advocates-report,,"WASHINGTON — Advocates Thursday raised alarm over immigrants with special deportation protections facing detainment across the country, as the Trump administration continues its aggressive mass deportation campaign. Home is Here, a coalition of advocates for immigrants with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, status, has documented a pattern of immigration agents targeting DACA recipients. At least 18 DACA recipients are detained, according to a Home is Here tracker. So far, Home is Here has pinpointed DACA recipients detained in Alabama,  Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Virginia.The immigrant advocates were joined at a press conference by congressional Democrats and family members of DACA recipients currently detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The lawmakers included Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Alex Padilla of Carlifornia and Reps. Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Delia Ramirez of Illinois. “The Trump administration is killing DACA piece by piece,” Garcia said. DACA tied up in courtThe Trump administration tried to end DACA during President Donald Trump’s first term, but the Supreme Court blocked the effort. Republican-led states have challenged the legality of DACA and its fate is tied up in an appeals court.There are roughly 550,000 DACA recipients, a program created under the Obama administration for undocumented children brought into the country without legal authorization by their parents. DACA allows that group to be shielded from deportation and obtain work authorizations and driver’s licenses. DACA recipients have to reapply every two years for a renewal fee of $520 and pass a background check.Ramirez said the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportation campaign is indiscriminately targeting immigrants and has instilled fear in Latino communities. “The whole (Trump) administration are waging a campaign of terror against our neighbors, against our own families, against our loved ones as they advance their fascist agenda and they try to cast immigrants as a public enemy,” said Ramirez, who is married to a DACA recipient and is the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants. The Democrats said they would continue to speak out against the detention of DACA recipients and provide assistance in litigation for families. A handful of Democrats have sued ICE over blocked access to detention facilities to conduct oversight. An arrest, and detainmentThe wife of a DACA recipient in ICE detention, Alejandra, who spoke at the press conference, said that she saw through a home security camera her husband, Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira, being arrested by masked men in the driveway of their Texas home.Alejandra said their children were in the car and they could be heard screaming on the video. Her husband remains in detainment. The ACLU of New Mexico said in a statement he is 28 years old and the father of four U.S. citizen children.“No family should ever have to endure that kind of terror,” she said. “For more than a decade, Paulo has been able to renew his status without issues. He has always followed the rules, done everything this country asked of him, and yet, under this administration, it feels like none of that matters anymore.”",,,,2025-09-18 14:58:27.212951

Mike Kehoe announced on May 27 that he will call a special legislative session to consider disaster relief, stadium funding and spending items (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe went on the offensive Wednesday against critics of the new congressional map approved by Missouri lawmakers, issuing a statement seeking to rebut charges that one Kansas City precinct was accidentally placed in two different districts.
The ACLU of Missouri, in a case filed last week in Jackson County, argues that the bill approved in a special session improperly designates a voting district of Kansas City to both the 4th Congressional District and the 5th District. While the lawsuit claims that alone should result in the map being thrown out, the ACLU also challenges the map on grounds it splits communities and violates the Missouri Constitution by changing the districts between federal censuses, which occur every 10 years.
The new congressional map is awaiting action by Kehoe, who called lawmakers into special session at the insistence of President Donald Trump. The goal is to give Republicans seven of the state’s eight congressional districts by redrawing the 5th District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat.
In the statement, Kehoe said he intends to sign the bill. The lawsuit’s allegations are wrong, he insists, because there are two distinct geographic areas with the same designation — VTD 811 — in the Census Bureau files used for determining the population of any particular location. That doesn’t mean, he said, the same voters are in two different districts. 
“The entire source of confusion is due to the existence of two entirely different VTDs using the same number,” he said.
The ACLU lawsuit is one of three pending cases that are challenging the state’s authority to revise congressional district lines between census reports. One, heard this week in Jefferson City, challenges Kehoe’s authority to call a special session for that purpose. 
Judge hears arguments in case seeking to toss Missouri’s new congressional maps

The other, also in Cole County, argues that no authority exists at all for the new map. 
The lawsuit filed in Jackson County is in a very early stage and the only hearing date set so far is a routine court appearance on Dec. 29. As she ponders the duplicate designation, Jackson County Circuit Judge Jalilah Otto must determine whether the bill passed by lawmakers provides enough information to know which of the two voting districts with the same name is in which district.
The ACLU contends that because the bill only lists the district, and not the smaller census blocks within the voting district, for the portions in the 4th District and the 5th District, it is flawed and therefore should be thrown out.
If the two areas with the same designation were properly assigned to different districts, the bill should have identified the census blocks that are part of each, the ACLU lawsuit states.
“We believe the double precinct is just one of several legal flaws which is why we are asking the court to prohibit this map or others from going into effect and to declare the 2022 map as Missouri’s lawful congressional map,” ACLU of Missouri spokesman Tom Bastian said in a statement provided by email. 
Former Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike Wolff said the courts must read the language of a bill and cannot add anything that is not included. Fixing any potential errors in the new map, Wolff said, would likely require action by the legislature. 
“Drafting errors are supposed to be corrected by new drafts,” Wolff said. “I don’t think you can interpret your way out of this.”
The information the bill does not contain is the geographic coding that the Census Bureau attaches to each of the voter tally districts — commonly known as precincts. Those files designate two precincts in Kansas City as KC811, corresponding with the 11th precinct of Kansas City’s 8th ward. One is assigned to the 4th District in the new map, while the other is assigned to the 5th.
That coding determines which of the two precincts — one containing 32 people, the other 843 — goes into which district, Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, the GOP’s chief redistricting organization, said in an interview with The Independent.
Kincaid said the descriptions are the same ones used in 2022 to redraw Missouri’s eight congressional districts. 
The bill describing the congressional districts currently in place, passed in 2022, has only one reference to KC 811. That is actually a flaw in that bill, Kincaid contends, and left some voters technically unassigned to a district.
In that case, “the current congressional or the previous congressional map would have been the one that was unconstitutional,” Kincaid said.
A properly written bill should use both designations, Kincadi said.
“If the two Kansas City 811s had both been assigned to district five, they would actually appear twice in district five,” Kincaid said. “If they had been assigned twice to district four, they would appear twice in district four. If one of them had been assigned and the other one not assigned, they would only appear once and the other one would have been left out because it was unassigned.”
Earlier this month, Kincaid produced a memo for the map’s legislative sponsor, Republican state Rep. Dirk Deaton of Noel, explaining the details of the new districts. But he insists that is not evidence that he had a hand in creating the map, pushing back on Democratic claims that the districts were drawn in Washington, D.C., as opposed to the governor’s office. 
“I’ll defer to the governor’s office, and what the governor said about the map on that,” Kincaid said. “The governor’s team clearly produced and developed this map.”
He said the point of the memo, which was obtained by The Independent, was to provide arguments about why the bill meets constitutional requirements for compact districts with connected geographic areas.
“I looked at the way the districts were drawn, and how they were drawn, and I gave a report to the representative about it,” Kincaid said. “I had been asked to do the report. So I did it.”
A spokeswoman for Kehoe said the map was drawn by members of the governor’s staff “with extensive knowledge and experience in the redistricting and map drawing process.”
Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, D-Affton, speaks against proposed Senate rule changes Wednesday during the special session for redistricting (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Democrats who oppose the new map said the duplicated description is an error that should sink the bill.
“I hope it is horribly fatal,” said state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City.
Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat, said the duplication is hard for Republicans to explain.
“The president told Missouri Republicans to pass his map ‘as is,’ and they did – with all its flaws,” Beck said. “Now, the governor has to choose between telling the president his ‘as is’ map might be wrong or signing a flawed map into law and hoping a judge doesn’t care. Any Republican who was told to blindly follow their leaders and not ask questions should be feeling pretty ticked off right about now.” 
Under pressure from Trump, Republicans took just 10 days for the special session. The two bills passed — changes to the majority requirements for passing constitutional amendments by initiative along with redistricting — were sped through the House, then approved in the Senate with no changes from the point they were introduced.
The Senate allowed only four hours of debate on redistricting and none on the initiative changes.
Battle lines remain fixed in Missouri Senate Republican factional fights as session ends

In 2022, redistricting dominated the entire session. The first bills were introduced in December, before the legislature convened, and the final version wasn’t passed until the last day of work in May.
“It is no surprise that the slapdash process in which the legislature engaged — ramming through the bill, failing to publicly release an electronic GIS file that legislators, staff, and the public could view and vet, and instead only releasing the district assignments in PDF to obscure the map from any transparency — resulted in the most basic of errors,” the ACLU lawsuit states.
Chuck Hatfield, a Jefferson City attorney representing opponents in one of the lawsuits in Cole County, said he was not aware of the duplicate designations when he filed his challenge.
“Our position is you’re not allowed to draw maps at all,” Hatfield said. “You can’t do that in between censuses. So our position is, we don’t care what this map looks like, you can’t be doing them.”
Hatfield said he thought the duplicated designation is a “fatal flaw” in the map.
Regardless of where the map was drawn or any potential flaws, Democratic state Sen. Stephen Webber of Columbia said the special session showed Republicans are determined to have complete power in the state and will not tolerate dissent.
Senate Republicans shut off debate on both bills passed during the special session, wouldn’t allow any debate on one, refused to consider amendments and removed state Sen. Lincoln Hough of Springfield as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee after he opposed the bills.
“This is about consolidating power,” Webber said, “and having as few people as possible run the state of Missouri.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052725_kehoe3-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-18 14:58:27.212951

U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves ordered a receiver in July 2022 over conditions that led to seven deaths the year before. He appointed Wendell France Jr., a public safety consultant who worked as an assistant jail warden in Maryland. 
France will take “operational control” Oct. 1 to fix ongoing unconstitutional conditions like understaffing and the state of facilities at the Raymond jail. He will remain in place no longer than necessary and transition operations and powers back to the county. 
Reeves issued the order after the most recent court monitor report compiled from visits to the jail and review of documents. There have been significant changes made since 2022, but ongoing problems remain, the monitors found. 
They gave county officials credit for permanently closing A Pod, a dangerous housing unit, and moving about 200 detainees to the privately operated Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in the Delta. Meanwhile, the remaining housing areas have deteriorated, the report states. 
Monitors identified staffing as the biggest problem and an impediment to proper supervision for detainees. Nearly 250 people are needed to operate the housing units, but less than a third of the positions are filled, the report notes. 
As justification for his order, Reeves wrote “‘the severity and immediacy of the current and ongoing constitutional violations at [the Raymond Detention Center], the failure of less extreme measures to ensure inmate safety, the need for compliance with the court’s orders, and the lack of leadership at RDC necessary to ensure compliance.’”
Sheriff Tyree Jones said his office has been working closely with the receiver for the last several months and will continue to work with France when he takes operational control. 
Hinds County Board of Supervisors President Robert Graham was not immediately available for comment Thursday. 
France previously started work at the jail in November 2023 and was preparing to take operational control at the beginning of the next year, but he had to stop after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay in favor of the county. 
The county has opposed receivership, arguing that it has made improvements and improved jail conditions. 
Hinds County officials appealed the receivership, which was dismissed last year. While a panel of the 5th Circuit agreed with Reeves’ ability to appoint a receiver, it ordered the judge reevaluate the scope of the receivership, notably authority over budget and related financial matters. 
Reeves has issued a new injunction and redefined the scope of the receivership in his June order. 
In 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice sued the county alleging a pattern or practice of unconstitutional conditions in its detention facilities. The county and DOJ entered a consent decree with changes to address jail conditions. 
There was back and forth over the years about whether the county was complying with the decree. In 2021, seven detainees died in the prison, which prompted Reeves to hold the county in contempt twice and hold hearings about whether to order receivership. 
In court and filings, county attorneys have argued that leaders were working with the consent decree and spending millions of dollars to repair the jail. There were also plans to build a new facility, which is currently under construction in Jackson.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/07081056/AP_831049974545-e1569885759897-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-18 14:58:27.212951

University of Vermont Health Network’s president and CEO, Sunil “Sunny” Eappen and the network’s board of trustees announced his resignation Thursday, less than one week after the state healthcare regulator slammed the Network for its high executive compensation and cost of care. The president of UVM Medical Center, Stephen Leffler, will serve as the interim president and CEO, according to a press release. 
An obstetric anesthesiologist, Eappen began at the UVM Health Network in November 2022, after working as a hospital administrator for 14 years at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston. He replaced John Brumsted, who was the network’s president for more than 10 years. 
The UVM Health Network includes three Vermont hospitals and three in upstate New York. In recent weeks, as the Green Mountain Care Board set annual hospital budgets for the coming fiscal year, the regulator took particular issue with the network’s reallocations of finances from its flagship University of Vermont Medical Center to its less profitable New York affiliates.   
Under Eappen’s leadership, hospitals in the UVM Health Network have seen costs increase dramatically, as the care board outlined during the hospital budget setting process. 
At the end of 2024, the network’s 19 top executives made a collective $3 million in bonuses. That same year, it announced the end of kidney transplant surgeries at the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, the end of the inpatient psychiatric unit at Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin and the closure of two affiliated clinics in the Mad River Valley. 
“It’s been my privilege to be part of this team, to see firsthand the way the people of this organization take care of our patients, our communities and each other,” Eappen said in a press release. “But I believe – based on everything that’s happening and all of the external pressures on our rural health system – that this organization needs to move forward in a different way. I’m committed to supporting Steve as a full partner in this transition.”
On Friday, the Green Mountain Care Board approved a 6.4% decrease in the rates that UVM Medical center charges commercial insurance and cut the hospital’s net revenue from those insurers from a proposed $1.16 billion to the approved $1.07 billion, leaving the hospital no margin to add to its reserves.

Lewis, one of Mississippi State's best ever players and a Dallas Cowboys legend, died this week at age 79. Columnist Rick Cleveland recounts his close friendship with Lewis.","D.D. Lewis, the great football linebacker, will be remembered at Mississippi State as one of the university’s most beloved athletes who happened to play on some of the school’s most abysmal teams. He died on Sept. 16 after being hospitalized for 12 days in Plano, Texas. He was 79.
In 1967, playing for a State team that did not win a single SEC game and lost nine of 10 overall, Lewis was named the SEC’s most outstanding defensive player and a first-team All American. He really did not make every tackle. It just seemed that way.

Rick Cleveland
There was some football justice for Lewis. After playing for such dreadful teams at State, he was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys, the so-called America’s Team for whom he became a cornerstone of their famed “Doomsday Defense.” He played in five Super Bowls and earned two Super Bowl rings. Overshadowed by linebacking teammates such as Leroy Jordan and Chuck Howley, Lewis never made the Pro Bowl. Legendary Cowboys coach Tom Landry, upon his retirement, called Lewis “the most under-appreciated player” in Landry’s 29 years with the team. 
But D.D. — a good and treasured friend to this writer — was so much more than that. He was a charming man who oozed charisma, despite admittedly battling inner demons for much of his life. He was the 14th of 14 children who grew up in poverty in the area of north Knoxville, Tennessee, where many families from Appalachia settled. 
Born a month after the end of World War II, D.D. was named for two American heroes of that war: Dwight Eisenhower and Douglas MacArthur. His was not a happy childhood. He was abused, both physically and mentally, as a young boy. 
“I stayed in trouble, both at school and at home,” he once told me. His mother once told him there was no use in doing his homework because he was never going to amount to anything. As a young teen, he was arrested more than once.
D.D.’s path out of all that was football. 
“Seems as long as I can remember, I was always striving for attention,” he told me in 1988. “I was a problem student, always getting into trouble and running with the wrong crowd. For a long time, that was my way of getting attention.”

D.D. Lewis at Mississippi State.
Then he found football. Football was his way out. Hitting people — hitting them really hard — brought him acclaim. At Knoxville’s Fulton High, he gained the attention and status his mother had told him would never come. His name was in the newspaper headlines. Sportscasters raved about him on radio and TV. College coaches recruited him. They praised him. They wanted him. For the 14th of 14, that meant so much.
Paul Davis, the head coach who successfully recruited him to Mississippi State, would later call him “the best linebacker I have ever seen.” 
But here’s the thing: The more praise D.D. received, the more he feared losing it, the more he feared failure. And that drove him to be better, to hit harder. He told me he had a recurring nightmare. 
“I’d be playing linebacker and a big hole would open up in the line,” he said. “And here’d come the running back, and he’d just flatten me.”
That rarely if ever happened in real life. D.D. was a tackling machine. When he retired from the Cowboys at age 36, he had reached the playoffs in 12 of his 13 seasons. He had appeared in 27 playoff games, an NFL record at the time. Indeed, even today, only Jerry Rice and Tom Brady have played in more playoff games. Peyton Manning, too, played in 27.
D.D. was at his best when it mattered most. In a 1975 NFC Championship victory over the Los Angeles Rams, he intercepted two passes. He had four interceptions total in playoff games, the most ever for a linebacker.
Sports writers loved him because he was so honest, such a good quote. Indeed, D.D. was the guy who said, “Texas Stadium has a hole in the roof, so God can watch his favorite team play.”
D.D. could tell a story, too. He once told one about Dandy Don Meredith, the Cowboys quarterbacking star who later sparred with Howard Cosell in the ABC Monday night TV booth.
“We were on a flight back from New York after beating up on the Giants,” D.D. said. “Drinks were flowing. Everybody was having a good time. And then we hear this loud explosion outside the plane, and the plane starts bucking and then the lights go on and off. The stewardesses were crying. I look around and some of our players are crying and some are praying. And then I looked across the aisle at Dandy Don, and he’s smiling. He took a big swig of his drink and then a big drag off his cigarette and said, ‘Well, boys, it’s been a good ‘un.’”
Of course, the jet eventually landed with one good engine, and D.D. enjoyed a pro career in which he never experienced a losing season. He was dependable and he was durable. He missed only two starts because of an injury. He played through aches and pains that would have sidelined most. He retired in 1981, mostly because there wasn’t a joint in his body that did not hurt. After 26 years of football, beginning with peewee ball at age 10, the whistles quit blowing and the “high” of competition, of victory and championships and all the glory that came with it disappeared. His identity had been football, and football was gone.
D.D. was lost. Years later, he would tell me he replaced the “highs” of football with alcohol and pain-numbing drugs. 
“It wrecked my life, it wrecked my marriage, it almost wrecked my relationship with my two daughters,” he said.
It didn’t help that the business he entered after football — the booming Texas oil business — went bust. He was broke. He even sold some of his Cowboys memorabilia, including his last helmet, to pay some bills.
“I am a lucky man,” he told me before his 2001 induction into the College Football Hall of Fame. “I got sober. I found the church, and there I found the Lord.”
He also reunited with an old college sweetheart, whom he married and settled down with in more ways than one.

“People ask me if I am sorry that I missed all those years with D.D. when he was a big football star with the Cowboys and all that,” Diane Lewis, his second wife, said. “No, I’m not. The D.D. I married was a loving, sober, God-fearing, gentle man. He wasn’t always that.”
D.D. became a fertilizer salesman who traveled the roads of central and east Texas, selling something his customers really needed. 
“I’m a shit salesman now,” D.D. once told me. “If you’re going to be a shit salesman, be a good one. I try to be.”
He told a story about one of his customers, a farmer who did not recognize him from his football days. They became good friends. Later on, the farmer was astounded to learn that his friend had once been a big football star for America’s Team. D.D. had never told him. D.D. never tooted his own horn.
“The man liked me because I was D.D. the fertilizer salesman, not because I had played in Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys,” he said. “You can’t imagine how much that meant to me.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18115837/AP528429870014.jpg,,,2025-09-18 14:58:27.212951

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)The use of Flock cameras in Colorado exemplifies the dark side of government surveillance. Proponents tout their law enforcement utility, but the outsize risk they pose to targeted residents and their contribution to Big Brother conditions in the state far outweigh any legitimate use to which they’re put.
Flock Safety cameras, often affixed to utility infrastructure above streets, capture images of passing vehicles from which information, particularly license plate numbers, is documented in a sharable and searchable database. The company has said its cameras are present in more than 5,000 communities across the country, including 75 in Colorado. They include Colorado Springs, Boulder, Durango, Longmont and Castle Rock.  
Concerns about Flock intensified this year as the Trump administration implemented its mass deportation policies, which unaccountable federal agents have carried out through kidnappings, the transfer of detainees to foreign prisons and other abuses.

In April, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent using the Loveland Police Department’s account conducted searches of Flock data on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The searches appear to have violated a state law that restricts state participation in federal immigration enforcement.
As Newsline reported last month, data collected by Flock’s 111 cameras in Denver was accessed in immigration-related national searches more than 1,400 times between June 2024 and April 2025. 
“This is more evidence conveying the serious threat the Flock mass surveillance system poses to the privacy and safety of not only immigrants in Denver, but across Colorado and the country,” the ACLU Colorado said in a statement when the Denver searches were exposed through a public information request.


Civil liberties advocates have long highlighted how government surveillance can intrude on the lives of everyday residents and result in abuses of power. Their warnings have only become more urgent amid recent technology advances and lawless behavior by federal agents.


The Denver City Council in May voted against renewing Flock’s contract. But Mayor Mike Johnston, who argues the camera network is an important tool for crime-fighting, extended the contract on his own. It expires at the end of October, and mass surveillance opponents are working to at least regulate so-called automatic license plate readers if they persist in the city beyond that date.
In a welcome move, the city established a task force to examine transparency and other concerns that surround the camera network. The task force includes representatives from Flock allies Johnston and the Denver police, but it also includes civil rights champions such as Denver City Council member Sarah Parady, an outspoken Flock critic. Parady has noted that the potential for misuse of Flock data goes well beyond immigration enforcement.
“Everyone is very rightfully focused on deportations, because we are seeing a crackdown, the likes which we’ve never seen,” Parady told Newsline last month. “But there are all kinds of ways that you can abuse surveillance data.”
Debate over the cameras comes as law enforcement agencies across the country increasingly rely on sophisticated technology to conduct omnipresent and warrantless surveillance. The practice erodes privacy protections and makes everyone, even the most law-abiding residents, vulnerable to repression.
A guest essay by a former public defender published by The New York Times this week paints a dystopian picture of New York City. Called “N.Y.P.D. Is Teaching America How to Track Everyone Every Day Forever,” the piece raises alarms about agencies around the country following New York’s lead as its police department goes about “building vast, hidden repositories of data it collects on everyone in the city, with no clear boundaries on how it can be used.” Using cameras, license plate readers, social media analysis and numerous other surveillance tools, the department knows “where you have been, whom you have interacted with and what you have said, thought and believed.”
Civil liberties advocates have long highlighted how government surveillance can intrude on the lives of everyday residents and result in abuses of power. Their warnings have only become more urgent amid recent technology advances and lawless behavior by federal agents.
Anaya Robinson, public policy director of ACLU Colorado, sees Denver’s Flock cameras as part of the larger network of national surveillance, which increasingly appears to violate Fourth Amendment protections and the Supreme Court-affirmed right to privacy in America.
“This surveillance really not only erodes that right to our privacy, but it also chills the use of our rights in a First Amendment context. It’s also able to surveil and look at what protests we’re going to, what religious institutions we are attending, what kinds of bars and stores we patronize,” Robinson said, adding, “Just because it makes it easier to potentially solve crime doesn’t mean that we should be eroding constitutional protections. What we should be doing is investing the money that we are spending on these surveillance technologies into programs and services that have proven time and time again to decrease crime rates rather than increase our ability to respond when crime occurs.”
The ACLU has a seat on the Denver task force, and Robinson said the organization wants to see the city establish legal guardrails if it continues to operate automatic license plate readers. But in no case should Denver continue using Flock cameras, Robinson said. Flock’s national database, allowing law enforcement anywhere in the country to surveil anyone anywhere in the country, poses particular and intolerable dangers. 
While the ACLU is helping to craft regulations with the task force, it maintains its position that Johnston should immediately cease use of the Flock network. That advice should be heeded by every city in Colorado that operates Flock cameras. If they value their residents’ fundamental rights, if they want to avoid chilling free speech and association, if they want to uphold the freedoms that the country was founded on, they would turn their cameras off right now.

National Park Service workers investigated the incident and found a carcass near where the hiker was attacked and confirmed grizzly tracks.
The man discharged bear spray during the attack and suffered wounds to his chest and arm. He was hiking alone in the Pelican Valley Bear Management Area, and was about 2.5 miles from the trailhead when he was attacked.
“Because this incident was a defensive reaction by the bear during a surprise encounter, the park will not be taking any management action against the bear,” the parks service said in a release.
The Turbid Lake Trail (Lake Butte Trailhead to the intersection of Pelican Valley Trail) will remain closed, the parks service announced.




Be bear aware

Yellowstone recommends the following to help avoid surprise bear encounters:

Carry bear spray and know how to use it.
Be alert. See the bear before you surprise it. Watch for fresh tracks, scat, and feeding sites (signs of digging, rolled rocks, torn up logs, ripped open ant hills).
Make noise.
Hike in groups of three or more people.
Stay 100 yards (91 meters) away from bears at all times.
Stay on trail and don’t hike at dawn, dusk, or at night, when grizzlies are most active.

Planned additions and improvements include a new Student Fitness Center, upgrades to the Rasmussen Fitness & Sports Center and the creation of the Jaywalk, a new pedestrian passageway linking Creighton to the Builder’s District, which is a separate office, entertainment and housing site under development by Noddle Companies.
Fly Together also includes a new Sports Performance Center for Creighton’s 300 student athletes, improvements to current athletics buildings and a team facility to complement new baseball and softball fields.
Construction on some elements, including the softball competition field, baseball practice field and Sports Performance Center, have already started.
 $100 million lead gift

Leading the initiative’s private contributions is a $100 million gift from the Heider Family Foundation, which Creighton described as the largest in its history. Other funders include Don Scott, CL and Rachel Werner and Larry and Linda Pearson.
The Rev. Daniel Hendrickson, Creighton’s president, highlighted what he hopes to be a stronger student body connection to downtown and broader Omaha
“This gift, and our campus master planning, is comprehensive of our people and programs,” he said. “It benefits everyone. It enhances student life, intramurals, premier club sports and intercollegiate athletics.”

Creighton, which this year welcomed the largest freshman class in history, touts a rigorous academic environment for its 8,914-member student body. But Hendrickson noted a recent focus on building that enhances “the experience” of the Creighton community.
Scott Heider, a trustee of the family foundation and a member of Creighton’s board, said the improved corridor ties Creighton’s east campus with the Builder’s District, providing a “front door” to the university.
The Builder’s District is a multimillion-dollar, mixed-use district southeast of 17th and Cuming Streets designed to include an urban park and community space, hotel, retail, restaurants, entertainment and 600 apartments. Its anchor is the new seven-story Kiewit Corp. headquarters completed in 2021.

Noddle, whose company also was master developer of Aksarben Village, said the goal is a seamless connection that blurs the line between Creighton and downtown Omaha.
“These developments are an innovative partnership,” Hendrickson said. “They bring the life of the university and the life of the city closer together than ever, continuing to build on Creighton’s investment in the urban core.”
 ‘The Quad’ 

Creighton also recently announced a nearly 6-acre “Creighton Quad” project, a 252,500-square foot quadrangle gathering space with a stage, amphitheater near 22nd and Burt Streets.
Cindy Heider, the foundation’s president, mentioned her family’s generational ties to Creighton. “That’s one of the biggest reasons we’re supporting Fly Together. Creighton is an amazing community, and we want to invite more people to be a part of it.”

Marcus Blossom, CU’s athletic director, said in a statement that he expects the investment to “help us win and help us compete with some of the best programs in the country.”
Creighton athletics has put the university in a national spotlight, supporters said, noting that it was the only school in the country to advance to the Elite Eight in men’s soccer, women’s volleyball, men’s basketball and women’s basketball in the last four years.
But men’s basketball head coach Greg McDermott said Creighton competes with institutions and conferences “that have astronomical TV contracts providing support for their students.”
He said the Fly Together investment helps keep the university competitive. 
Creighton leaders expect the new Student Fitness Center and upgrades to the Rasmussen Center to further build fitness, intramurals and club sports programs. This year, Creighton added six premier club sports, women’s and men’s programs for ice hockey, golf and lacrosse.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight) SIOUX FALLS — Attorney General Marty Jackley announced Thursday that five people — a former guard, two inmates and two others — face charges in connection with an alleged conspiracy to bring drugs and contraband into the South Dakota State Penitentiary.
“It’s always begged the question: Where are the drugs coming from? How are they getting into the prison? And today we’re able to answer that,” Jackley said during a press conference at the Sioux Falls Convention Center.
He announced that a Minnehaha County grand jury on Wednesday indicted former correctional officer Carson DeYoung, 22, of Sioux Falls; inmates Max Bolden, 42, and Simba Oma Maat, 25; and two other people, Nancy Sage, 52, of Sioux Falls, and Chandler Boone, 31, of Denver.
Myriad charges filed
All five face felony charges for allegedly conspiring to distribute meth and a synthetic form of marijuana known as K2, along with allegedly conspiring to deliver cellphones. They also face a misdemeanor charge for allegedly conspiring to deliver vape pens.
DeYoung faces additional counts for possessing and allegedly agreeing to smuggle anabolic steroids. Sage faces extra charges for allegedly possessing meth and K2.
Overdose deaths, gang violence draw charges in some — not all — recent prison incidents

If convicted of all the charges, all five could face decades in prison and tens of thousands of dollars in fines.
Jackley alleged that Boone obtained items and mailed them to Sage, who worked with DeYoung to get them into the prison. A press release from Jackley’s office said “DeYoung had not yet transported these particular items into the pen but had agreed to do so,” adding, “There is an ongoing investigation as to what other items DeYoung may have transported into the pen.”
The indictment covers crimes allegedly committed Aug. 8-14.
“I’m not suggesting there isn’t more activity, but that’s what we focused on with respect to these charges,” Jackley said.
Bolden is already serving a life sentence for murder. Maat is incarcerated for burglary convictions, with release scheduled in 2028. Because both are already serving prison sentences, their maximum sentences if convicted of the new charges would be doubled under state law, Jackley explained.
Jackley said the state Division of Criminal Investigation led the investigation with cooperation from the state Department of Corrections and the Sioux Falls Area Drug Task Force, including staff from the Sioux Falls Police Department and the Minnehaha County Sheriff’s Office.
“Transporting illegal items into the prison makes the facility less safe for staff and inmates,” Jackley said. “We will not tolerate such activity.”
Jackley said the investigation is ongoing and could result in more charges.
New prison vote looms
In response to questions from reporters, Jackley said the indictments had nothing to do with Department of Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko’s recent resignation announcement or the legislative vote scheduled Tuesday on a $650 million plan to replace the oldest parts of the penitentiary with a new men’s prison at a separate site in northeast Sioux Falls.
When asked if better facilities could have helped prevent the alleged crimes, Jackley said criminal activity will always occur in prisons, but new security systems could help.
“This is an outdated facility that needs to be replaced for the safety of the officers involved, for the prison staff, including medical nurses, as well as other inmates,” Jackley said.
The new charges come after a string of unrest, deaths and allegedly criminal incidents at the penitentiary and other state prison facilities during the past several years. That includes an announcement by the state Department of Corrections in May that it had busted a ring of drug smuggling in prison facilities with the aid of the Division of Criminal Investigation and the U.S. Postmaster General’s Office.
Rash of state employee criminal allegations
The new charges against a former correctional officer continue a run of criminal allegations against former state employees related to their work for state government.
Since July of 2024, Jackley has won convictions against former state employees whose crimes included stealing $1.8 million over the course of 13 years from the state Department of Social Services, creating fake vehicle titles to avoid taxes, filing false food-service inspection reports, using grocery vouchers intended for foster families, and self-issuing a medical marijuana card.
Some lawmakers skeptical as governor pledges rehab task force ‘following the passage’ of prison bill

In response, Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during this year’s legislative session that expanded the investigatory authority of the state auditor; strengthened the Board of Internal Controls; instituted mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report; and established protections for whistleblowers.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order in April mandating the creation of a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal delivers whistleblower reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.
Lawmakers also passed legislation this year strengthening the ability of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee to conduct investigations and issue orders known as subpoenas requiring people to testify or supply information.
Last year, then-Gov. Kristi Noem added an extra internal control officer position to the executive branch and ordered state employees to undergo annual training aimed at preventing criminal activity

MONTPELIER — Vermont’s Agency of Transportation is laying off 16 employees and cutting a dozen more vacant positions as part of a plan to trim its budget for the current fiscal year to match a reduction in projected revenue over that same time period.
Employees were slated to receive formal notice they were being laid off Thursday, according to Jayna Morse, the agency’s director of finance and administration. At least five of the workers being laid off have enough seniority that they have a clear path to take other jobs in state government, Morse said.
The cuts are expected to save the agency $2.25 million. It’s the largest slice of a $7.5 million “rescission plan” the agency is enacting after getting approval for the reductions from a Vermont legislative panel Thursday. While legislators needed to greenlight the overall plan, the agency was already moving ahead with the layoffs ahead of Thursday morning’s vote, according to Morse.  
The agency was required to come up with cuts after state economists, in July, scaled back their estimates — by that same $7.5 million figure — for the amount of money the state would likely have available to fund its transportation program over the 2026 fiscal year. That timeframe started in July and ends next June 30.
Other cuts in the rescission plan include delaying construction projects, reducing the amount of preventative maintenance and mowing along roadways, and putting off the purchase of several new vehicles until a future budget year.
This story will be updated.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A $3 million tutoring initiative will support small-group literacy instruction in rural schools and Oklahoma’s two largest districts.
The Oklahoma State Department of Education announced Thursday it will distribute $1 million to Tulsa Public Schools, $1 million to Oklahoma City Public Schools and $1 million to split across 100 rural districts, which will receive $10,000 each.
Districts will put the funds toward reading tutoring to help students who have fallen behind. Testing in 2024 found only 23% of Oklahoma fourth graders and 20% of eighth graders in the state performed at a proficient level in reading.
The grant program continues state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ focus on tutoring initiatives. His administration previously used federal pandemic aid funds to support high-dosage tutoring programs, which have students meet in small groups multiple times a week for extra instruction.
After pandemic aid expired in September 2024, the Oklahoma Legislature dedicated $5 million in state funds to high-dosage tutoring programs this year. The Education Department did not return a request for comment on the specific funding source of the $3 million initiative.
“Literacy is the foundation for everything our students learn,” Walters said in the announcement. “The bottom line is: if you can’t read you can’t be successful. By investing in targeted tutoring, we are giving Oklahoma students the tools they need to succeed in school, in their careers, and in life. This is about results, accountability, and making sure every child has the opportunity to thrive.”

The $1 million in rural school grants, called the Rural Literacy Acceleration Initiative, will reimburse 100 districts for teacher stipends and instructional materials needed for tutoring.
Using its $1 million grant to launch TPS READS, Tulsa Public Schools aims to provide 20 high-impact tutoring sessions for each participating student. The program will focus on children in first through eighth grade in need of targeted reading and math tutoring.
“We’re grateful for this investment and committed to using these resources to accelerate learning, with a clear focus on student outcomes and academic momentum,” Tulsa Superintendent Ebony Johnson said in a statement. “This grant comes at a critical time and will support learners across Tulsa Public Schools.”
Oklahoma City schools will put its funds toward early literacy in first through fourth grade, calling the tutoring program Project LIFT. The district will use high-dosage tutoring to address “significant literacy skill deficits,” the announcement reads.
“By providing structured, data-driven support, Project LIFT helps ensure every child builds the skills and confidence needed to thrive in school and beyond,” Oklahoma City Superintendent Jamie Polk said.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)The elected vice chairperson for the Montana Democratic Party resigned his post just days after taking office following remarks critical of former U.S. Sen. Jon Tester.
This weekend at their state convention, Montana Democrats elected new executive leadership, including Shannon O’Brien as chairperson and Max Johansen as vice chairperson.
O’Brien pledged a fresh start for Democrats, according to media outlets at the convention including the Montana State News Bureau. Democrats have lost elections handily in Montana in recent years.
O’Brien is a former state senator from Missoula, previous head of Missoula College and education policy advisor to former Gov. Steve Bullock. She ran an unsuccessful bid for Superintendent of the Office of Public Instruction in 2024.
Just days after the Sunday convention, the Montana Democratic Party released a statement from O’Brien on the resignation of Johansen as vice chairperson on the executive board. O’Brien did not respond to voicemails requesting comment this week.
Johansen is chairperson of the Park County Democrats.
“This morning, I accepted the resignation of Max Johansen, creating a vacancy on the Montana Democratic Party Executive Board,” O’Brien said in the statement Wednesday. “Mr. Johansen resigned after acknowledging that certain comments he made following the convention were disruptive and inconsistent with the direction of the executive board.”
The Montana Free Press reported that Johansen criticized Tester, a Democrat who lost his bid for a fourth term in the U.S. Senate in November 2024, after the election at the convention in a conversation with reporters.
Johansen said “a lot of people” are upset with Tester for not being as aggressive as he could be in opposing Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, who ousted him, according to the Free Press. He also said Democrats need to “stop running” from the word “socialist” in reference to “direct aid” to vulnerable groups.
In a “Grounded” podcast episode following the convention, Tester responded. “Grounded” is a conversation between Tester and journalist Maritsa Georgiou, and Georgiou raised Johansen’s claims in the episode.
Tester, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, said on the show Johansen “doesn’t know Jacks–t,” he doesn’t know Montana, and he’s dangerous to Democrats.
“The Democrats have a fox in the henhouse, and if they don’t clean it up, there won’t be any eggs to pick,” Tester said.
The Daily Montanan could not reach Johansen for comment late Wednesday.
At their convention, the Montana Democrats said they also selected the following leaders, in addition to other district members:

During a presentation Wednesday night on the state’s new strategic plan, Green noted that North Carolina ranks 48th in the nation for education spending, spending thousands less per student than neighbors like Virginia and South Carolina.
When adjusted for regional cost differences, North Carolina ranks 48th in the nation for per-student spending, falling nearly $5,000 below the national average, and 49th in “funding effort,” a measure of how much a state spends on education relative to its economic capacity.

“While I think there was certainly mismanagement of resources in Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools,” Green said, “it also is the case that it’s operated in a situation where we are underfunding our public schools pretty dramatically.”
The district’s financial turmoil has led to hundreds of job cuts this year, with assistant principals, support staff and employees in the Exceptional Children’s program among those affected.
A state audit report released in August found the district used temporary COVID-19 relief funds to pay permanent salaries, approved spending without money in the budget and delayed basic account reconciliations. Auditors also flagged misuse of “suspense accounts,” where at one point more than $332 million sat without clear tracking. 
While auditors found no fraud, state leaders said the report revealed years of weak oversight. Earlier this month, the State Board of Education ordered a new outside audit of the district and imposed a 0.4% monthly interest rate on $3.4 million the district owes the state. 
Still, Green stressed that despite financial strain, the district must keep moving forward with improvements.
“Our students can’t wait,” he said. “It’s not like we can tell our students sit tight into fourth grade till we get this figured out in Winston-Salem/Forsyth.”
Green made the comments while speaking at a forum organized by the advocacy group Public Schools First NC.
“Even as you have to make adjustments, continue to remember what the ultimate goal is,” Green added.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Getty-images-classroom.jpg,,,2025-09-18 13:58:47.994046
,Mississippi Today,2025-09-18 16:44:44+00:00,Mississippi Today,Rankin County schools seek release from desegregation order,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/18/rankin-county-schools-seek-release-from-desegregation-order/,The Rankin County School District is seeking to end a federal desegregation order the system has been under for 55 years.,"“Perfection is not the standard” when it comes to desegregation, the  attorney for Rankin County School District told a federal judge this week as he sought to end a four-times-amended desegregation order the system has been under for 55 years.
The district is “practically unrecognizable,” John Hooks said Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Jackson. There aren’t “Black” and “white” schools in the district with mostly Black and white staff and students.
But plaintiffs who sued the district in 1967 for maintaining a segregated school system weren’t convinced. And their attorneys through the Legal Defense Fund had experts in tow along with student and faculty data to provide evidence for what they long experienced: vestiges of a dual school system that treated Black students and staff differently.
“They want it gone so they can do what they want to do here,” said Janie McLaurin of the district’s most recent effort to free itself of the desegregation order.
A hearing was called to determine whether Rankin County School District should be released from its desegregation order. U.S. District Judge Kristi Johnson can call for the case to go to trial or rule on the issue.
Three years before most Mississippi schools integrated, Black parents and students sued the school district for maintaining a segregated school system for Black and white students.
The federal court set down a plan for the district to integrate in 1970, 1973, 1978, and 2012. In 2019, the district was able to prove to the court that facilities and busing were equitable for Black and white students, leaving student and staff assignments, extracurricular activities and student discipline still out of compliance with the court order.
“Every nook and cranny of the district’s operations have been inspected by the DOJ and the (Legal Defense Fund),” he said of the Department of Justice and the legal aid group representing the interest of Black parents.
First outlined in the 1970 order and further clarified in the 2012 order, the district had to maintain a balance of Black and white students in each school that was within 20 percentage points in either direction of their percentage districtwide.
In the last five years, the white student population in the district has decreased from about 68% to 63% while the Black student population has increased from 25% to 29%. 
At Flowood Elementary in the last 10 years, the Black student population has increased from 23% to 34%, the white population has decreased from 66% to 42% and the population of students of other races has increased from 11% to 24%.
“After six decades, the Rankin County School District has arrived,” Hooks said. The district was looking forward to integrating “not just in fact but also in law.”
He also acknowledged the courage of the plaintiff, who  he said “are in large part why we’re here today.”
More than an old piece of paper

McLaurin remembers when she joined the lawsuit against the school district as a Brandon student 58 years ago. She also recalls a teacher calling her “negress” and white female students shoving her in the restrooms.
She and her mother joined the suit because she wanted the quality public education then reserved only for white students in the county. As a result, she was able to secure positions that were out of reach previously for Black applicants at the Rankin County Tax Assessor’s Office.
“It’s crazy that it’s still going on,” she said outside the courtroom. “It’s something my children had to go through, and now my grandchildren.”
In court, McLaurin was joined by Angela English, head of the Rankin County NAACP.
“It’s been 55 years since the 1970 court order, and here we are in court about the same things,” English said. “It is important that we hold the school district accountable. There are still multiple school districts that are segregated and Black (applicants) that are being overlooked in the hiring process.”
A desegregation order is more than just a request for annual reporting, parents and community members can invoke it to seek to put a stop to discriminatory practices in their district. 
It put a stop to the disproportionate jailing of Black students at Meridian Public School District for throwing spit balls and for other minor infractions while white students with the same disciplinary background got off with lighter sentences. It forced an Arizona district to continue offering a Mexican American Studies course to engage a large Latino student population after the district pulled it.
The Department of Justice under President Trump has signalled willingness to release more school districts from desegregation orders. More school districts were released from desegregation orders during Trump’s first administration than under the past four presidents.
With Copiah County School District’s release from its desegregation order in August, Mississippi now has 29 districts remaining under such orders. In the last 10 years, Justice Department officials have visited Rankin County schools at least twice to check for progress.
What they knew
In the cross examination of Assistant Superintendent Amanda Stocks, the plaintiffs’ attorney pointed out the district checked the references for a white applicant for a job but not the Black applicant, who was not hired for the position despite receiving the same score after her interview as her white counterpart. 
An investigative report undertaken by Erica Frankenberg, a researcher on racial desegregation, found the district had missed between 20 and 30 opportunities to diversify its staff, passing on qualified Black applicants in favor of white ones.
The district currently has one Black teacher in the gifted and talented program.
McLaurin said she encouraged a Black person to apply for a music teacher position at the schools in Pigsah but was told after a few weeks with no response by the district that the position had been already filled. English said the district had not started recruiting for teachers on the campus of Jackson State University until last year. 
“Some leadership positions are not open to Black staff,” said the plaintiff’s attorney.
In some cases, Stocks argued, the district hired Black applicants for different roles than what they had applied for. Therefore, she said, the data about teacher hiring was not entirely accurate. She also noted the district’s recent efforts to recruit from Historically Black Colleges and Universities through targeted radio ads.
The plaintiffs’ also questioned her about why 24 of the 25 approved inner-district transfers to Pisgah High School were white, resulting in the school falling out of compliance by having an overrepresentation of white students the following year.
Stocks attributed the change in part to state law that allows district employees to transfer their kids to the community schools where they work.
Florence Elementary and Middle, Flowood Elementary, and Pisgah Elementary and High schools fell out of compliance this year by 1-3 percentage points. In past years, they have similarly fallen out of compliance with white students overrepresented, except at Flowood Elementary, where they were underrepresented.
‘In Good Faith’
The plaintiffs’ attorneys also raised the issue of white students overrepresented on the cheer team as well as other student extracurricular activities and student programming. 
Florence High and McLaurin High schools each has one Black cheerleader, while Puckett High School has none. Though Black students made up nearly 29% of the district student body in the 2022-2023 academic year, the Black student population of the gifted and talented program was about 12%, the plaintiffs’ attorney said.
The district offered statistics meant to demonstrate the district’s progress toward providing a quality education to minority students. 
Brandon Elementary won a blue ribbon for closing the achievement gap for Black students in 2021, Hooks, the district’s attorney, told the court. Black students post higher graduation grades and lower drop-out rates in the district. 
Stocks also spoke of Teacher Leadership Training, an initiative in which faculty are “educated on matters of the heart,” on different ethnicities, “celebrating diversity,” and being “sensitive to other cultures.”
“I’m convinced the district will continue to do the work,” Stocks said. “Everything we do is done because we believe it’s right for our students and for our staff. Things have been brought to our attention and we’ve acted up on it in good faith.”
“Families feel welcome by teachers that look like them,” she added to qualify her support for encouraging diversity among the staff.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06100112/3X0A3836-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-18 12:58:38.837735

John Sauer wrote in a 41-page appeal that a district court blocking President Donald Trump’s efforts to remove Cook “involves yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President’s removal authority—here, interference with the President’s authority to remove members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for cause.”Trump has had an ongoing dispute with the independent Federal Reserve Board for months, repeatedly calling on them to lower interest rates, which they did on Wednesday. Trump said in late August that he wanted to remove Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board, alleging she falsified some information in a mortgage application. Cook’s attorneys filed a lawsuit in federal court a few days later, arguing that Trump’s attempts were political and violated her due process rights. U.S. District Judge Jia M. Cobb granted a preliminary injunction in early September, writing the case marks the first time in the Federal Reserve’s 111-year history that a president has sought to remove one of its members “for cause.”The Federal Reserve Act doesn’t actually define what “for cause” entails, but Cobb wrote that reasons for firing under the law “are limited to grounds concerning an official’s behavior in office and whether they have been faithfully and effectively executing statutory duties. “The ‘for cause’ standard thus does not contemplate removing an individual purely for conduct that occurred before they assumed the position.”The Trump administration appealed that ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.A three-judge panel from that court earlier this week rejected the Trump administration’s request to overturn the district court’s preliminary injunction while the case proceeds.The 2-1 ruling split Judge Gregory G. Katsas, whom Trump nominated during his first term, and Judges J. Michelle Childs and Bradley N. Garcia, both nominated by former President Joe Biden.Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2025-09-18 12:58:38.837735

The partnership marks the latest move by states to take charge of public health at the state and regional level in the face of uncertainty over federal public health policy under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
“In a time of significant change in public health, we have benefited from the enhanced collaborations between our jurisdictions. We are confident that we will preserve and protect core public health principles and services as we navigate current changes together,” Connecticut Department of Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani stated in a Thursday announcement.
The coalition comprises Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and New York City. Four western states — California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii — formed the West Coast Health Alliance, a similar partnership, earlier this month. 
Last week, Gov. Ned Lamont issued a slew of executive actions seeking to protect COVID-19 vaccine access in Connecticut amid recent federal changes that are causing confusion over who’s eligible for shots, where people can get them and how much they’re going to cost.
Despite updated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that limited approval of updated boosters to people 65 and older, as well as those with underlying health conditions, the Connecticut Department of Public Health issued guidance encouraging children 6 months and older, as well as adults of all ages, to get vaccinated. 
The state’s Department of Consumer Protection also issued guidance that sought to facilitate access to the boosters at local pharmacies, and a bulletin from the Connecticut Insurance Department guaranteed coverage of the shots for certain residents.
“As uncertainty in Washington continues, our administration is doing everything we can to ensure the residents of Connecticut have access to the health care they need to stay safe,” Lamont stated in a press release last week announcing the state-specific COVID-19 vaccine guidance. 
The work of the Northeast Public Health Collaborative is already underway. The group held its first informal in-person meeting in August and has already formed working groups to address several high-priority issues, including public health emergency preparedness, vaccine recommendations and purchasing, and data collection and analysis.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20210726_ManishaJuthani_Hartford_YK_145-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-18 12:58:38.837735

But at the nation’s largest pro-housing conference, there was some decided ambivalence about whether the Massachusetts approach has worked out as hoped. 
Organizations that spent the past four years boosting and working to implement the law told their peers in other states that the tailored town-by-town approach is complicated, inefficient, and ultimately not enough to address a severe housing crunch. While MBTA Communities tried to accommodate a tradition of local control and sense of community ownership, they said, it created too much room for foot dragging and resistance.  
Advocates said the shortcomings of the 2021 housing law argue for more muscular state zoning reform that leads to substantial new construction and limits cities’ and towns’ ability to flout state mandates.  
Legislative appetite for strengthening the housing law, however, is minimal.   
“I think MBTA Communities was really optimistic, in that we thought local communities would want to control their own zoning, and they’d go through these processes in good faith,” said Will Rhatigan, MBTA Communities engagement manager for the Citizens’ Housing and Planning Association, a non-profit housing advocacy organization, at a panel at the national YIMBYtown 2025 conference this week. “And many of them did, but it took so much effort, so much time, that I don’t think we could realistically do it again for any other zoning reform. We’ve eaten up that political capital.” 
The “YIMBY,” or Yes In My Back Yard, movement is focused on a relatively simple pitch: Addressing the housing crisis requires building more housing, at all price points, in most places. The name is a counter to the pejorative “NIMBY,” or Not In My Back Yard, characterization of people and areas who may say there is a need for more housing, but their immediate vicinity is not the right place to put it. 
Discussion of Massachusetts housing policy at the national conference – which drew over 1,000 attendees to New Haven, Connecticut – kept returning to the MBTA Communities law. Passed in a 2021 economic development bill, the housing law said that cities and towns with MBTA service “shall” zone for a multi-family district of “reasonable size” near that transit.  
The 177 cities and towns affected by the law had to vote in compliant zoning, “which opens up a whole bunch of headaches,” said Jesse Kanson-Benanav, executive director of the pro-housing advocacy group Abundant Housing Massachusetts. Not the least of those, he said, is the firestorm around a few dozen municipalities forcefully objecting and sparking lawsuits across the state. 
“We crafted this law in a way that we thought was responding to the unique aspect of local control, local decision making, Town Meeting form of government we have in Massachusetts, but that made it incredibly difficult,” he said. Between the nonprofits, quasi-public agencies, state agencies, and others, he estimated tens of millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of hours of staff time have so far “gone in to implementing this act that is really monumental for Massachusetts, but ultimately, in and of itself, is not going to get us to the 200,000 plus homes that we need to build in the next 10 years just to meet the expected demand for housing.” 
The state Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities set out time frames for adopting compliant zoning and specific rules for different municipalities depending on the nature of their public transportation, such as rapid transit or being adjacent to a community with a commuter rail station. Thirty-five municipalities still have until the end of 2025 to submit compliant plans.  
Attorney General Andrea Campbell, elected in 2022 and succeeding now-Gov. Maura Healey as the state’s top prosecutor, identified housing in general and MBTA Communities enforcement specifically as an early priority. Her office sent out an advisory to all the municipalities on March 15, 2023, warning them that noncompliance risked not only a loss of grant funds but enforcement action by her office. 
As Assistant Attorney General Eric Haskell put it bluntly at a YIMBYtown panel on state housing laws, “what it said, essentially is: This is real. You gotta do this. We take it very seriously. And if you don’t do it, we’re gonna sue your ass.” 
Some communities like Lexington, Arlington, and Brookline took up the rezoning task briskly. Others dug in their heels, criticizing the law as “one-size-fits-all” and placing an unreasonable burden on towns with limited zoning capacity.  
The wealthy Boston suburb of Milton initially approved a plan that would comply at its 2023 Town Meeting, only for voters to toss the plan by referendum early the next year. It was the first municipality to miss its deadline for compliance, and other towns like Holden, Winthrop, and Marshfield (the first municipality to sue the state over MBTA Communities) indicated their intention to ignore the law as well. 
They seemed to be banking on the only consequence being the loss of four grants specifically named in the original legislation, which Haskell noted was considered a minor issue for a number of municipalities.  
“It wasn’t a very big stick,” he said, adding that the attorney general’s office decided to sue Milton in a way that would get fast tracked to the state Supreme Judicial Court. 
“Frankly, our audience for that lawsuit on one level was Milton,” Haskell said. “On another level, it was the other hundred-something municipalities that were facing deadlines six or 12 or 18 months down the road. We wanted to set the precedent, so to speak.” 
The state’s high court in January 2025 handed the AG’s office broad power to enforce state law. The state housing office would have to put out regulations again properly, the court ordered. Once new regulations were in place, the attorney general was free to enforce the law with all of her available powers. 
Since the law took effect, 12 municipalities and four taxpayer groups filed lawsuits in Superior Court seeking exemptions from the law because it is, in their view and in the state auditor’s assessment, an “unfunded mandate.”  
Most have been dismissed, either by court or voluntarily. Some noncompliant towns are currently appealing a ruling from Superior Court Judge Mark Gildea, who declared in June that the law is not an “unfunded mandate,” nor were the requirements for compliance put forward improperly. An appeal by Weston is filed with the Appeals Court. Marshfield filed with the Appeals Court and asked for direct review from the Supreme Judicial Court. 
The Commonwealth has filed a response stating that it agrees that the SJC should take the case, according to the attorney general’s office, “given the urgency of addressing the housing shortage and the impact the pending cases are having on local decision-making in Fall town meetings.” 
Of the 177 MBTA Communities, 140 have submitted or adopted zoning to comply with the law, according to state data. As of September 15, the housing office determined 116 of these plans are fully or conditionally compliant, and 15 have refused to adopt compliant zoning by their July 14 deadline. Some of the noncompliant towns are also suing the state, while others are waiting for court rulings before acting.

Kanson-Benanav noted that Winthrop has been “in ground zero battles” over the MBTA Communities law, which is at the heart of a current recall effort and the November elections in the North Shore town. Winthrop recently lost out on $1.2 million in critical flood prevention grants because the grants were tethered to compliance with the housing law.  
The Town Council in June deadlocked on a zoning plan that would have brought Winthrop into compliance, which meant the plan did not pass and the town missed the state deadline to comply.  
Polling on the MBTA Communities law, and more development near transit generally, finds it to be reasonably popular among residents. But some local resistance is pronounced enough that the Republican candidates for governor, including the economic development chief during the Baker administration that signed the law in the first place, are hammering the Healey administration approach as an unacceptable intrusion into local governance. 
The state so far credits the housing law with 5,200 homes built or in development.
“In the broadest strokes, my sense of the original intent of the law was to require all communities near transit to adopt a zone that allowed for modest multi-family housing, and I think the law has really led to movement in that direction,” said Luc Schuster, executive director of Boston Indicators, a research center at the Boston Foundation.  
“What it was not designed for and has not done is lead to tens of thousands of new housing units, the scale of which would really make a dent in the region’s affordability crisis,” Schuster said in an interview after the conference. That kind of rezoning, he said, would really require follow up legislation. 
Housing advocates acknowledge legislators are already a tough audience for rezoning pitches. The body is dominated by homeowners, and Massachusetts lawmakers are nervous because of the public disputes over MBTA Communities.  
“All of that has made further conversations around very necessary zoning reforms in Massachusetts very difficult to have in the Legislature,” said Kanson-Benanav, whose organization is pushing for legislation this session that would codify several YIMBY priorities like generally allowing five-unit construction, removing parking minimums, and removing minimum lot size requirements.  
Panelists all said unified statewide rezoning is on their wish list, with clear ways to enforce the law. They pointed to the recent housing bond bill, which legalized accessory dwelling units by right wherever single-family homes are allowed, as a good example of just planting a flag and telling the municipalities to get on board.  
“I think we are going to be able to do zoning changes,” said Katharine Lacy, program manager for the MBTA Communities technical assistance program with the Massachusetts Housing Partnership. But the MBTA Communities model isn’t ideal, she said, because of how much work it took to tailor each municipality’s plan, even as organizations streamlined the process of connecting cities and towns with resources and consultants. 
“It was too effing complicated,” she said.  
Lacy was involved in creating the MBTA Communities policy documents, but “we made it too hard.” When it comes to broader scale upzoning, she said, “I think we can do it, but I think we need to keep it simple. We need to assume there’s going to be some bad blood and some good faith effort.” 
Housing experts note that they still don’t know how much housing will directly result from the rezoning changes. And however the MBTA Communities lawsuits resolve, state housing officials and advocates agree on one thing: the policy is no silver bullet. 
“I think the first thing that’s going to happen in the short term is that people are going to let the dust settle out of all this stuff,” said John Cruz, senior housing and land use planner at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, during the YIMBYtown panel discussion of the law. 
Some places may see modest construction, others little to none. Cruz said MAPC will be looking closely at the reaction from communities where there seem to be surges in development, like Arlington. After being the first to comply with the law and exceeding its requirements, the town scaled back its rezoning in the face of an unexpectedly large development boom. 
While the MBTA Community process did offer a chance for advocacy groups – and opponents of the law – to build organizing muscle across the region, Massachusetts YIMBYtown attendees say the process became an energy and attention sink. 
“The Legislature says, ‘All I’m hearing is the horror stories around MBTA Communities, and what I’m hearing from the NIMBY voices in my town makes me think that no one wants to do any other zoning reform,’” Kanson-Benanav said. “I believe strongly that those are in the minority… but the fact that we focus so much on the local control over implementation, and the design of this law, has made some of those important future reforms very, very difficult.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1043-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C545&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-18 12:58:38.837735

Sept. 17, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceOpposition to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ request for proposals to rebid contracts for the state’s prepaid inpatient health plan providers continues to grow, and on Wednesday, a group of service providers and health advocates again  warned that the move would lead to the privatization of public mental health services.
The department in August put out the call for proposals from nonprofit organizations to manage the state’s behavioral health services, drawing criticism from recipients of those services as well as providers and mental health advocates who say they’d been left out of the decision.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXWhile the request for proposals has set a Sept. 29 deadline, a host of mental health service managers and providers has filed a lawsuit against the department in hopes of keeping the process from moving forward. 
The state’s current system is made up of 10 regional administrative entities known as prepaid inpatient health plans, which manage Medicaid funding for mental health in the region, and also deliver Medicaid-covered services with providers throughout the state.
Lynn Sutfin, a spokesperson for the state health department, told Michigan Advance in an email that the request for proposals was issued to reflect “significant structural changes designed to improve service quality, increase accountability and enhance administrative efficiency across the system.”
The proposal was developed with “extensive feedback collected from Medicaid beneficiaries, family members, advocacy organizations, community-based groups and other stakeholders,” Sutfin said. The fragmentation of the plans, service inconsistency and a lack of accountability have been cited as common issues within the current system.
“The competitive bidding process is designed to address these concerns by creating a more unified, transparent and balanced behavioral health system,” Sutfin said.

However, Macomb County Commissioner Antoinette Wallace, told reporters at a press conference that the department’s proposal would shift oversight for 90% of the funding for public mental health services from county-based entities, to private agencies with no accountability to the public.
While similar efforts have been tried in other states, Wallace, who is also the upcoming president of the Michigan Association of Counties, said that shift  led to a loss of providers, increases in bureaucracy and higher costs without improvements in care.
“A strength of Michigan’s mental health services is this public and community oversight and participation,” Wallace said. “Yet just a few blocks down here in their office towers in Lansing, the leadership of [the department] somehow has determined this system is not only insufficient, but is best improved by putting unaccountable private firms in charge.”
Former U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Lansing), a longtime champion for mental health services in the state, also criticized the proposed shift.
“We’re talking about a proposal that would replace a managed care system that is transparent and cost about 2% for a private managed system that is not transparent and will cost more like 15% tell me about the math on that one, resulting in $500 million in additional [overhead] costs,” Stabenow said.
What’s more concerning, Stabenow said, is layering a shift to a private system with Medicaid cuts approved by Republicans in Congress. She argued those cuts will pull the rug out from tens of thousands of Michiganders in recovery.
Approximately 300,000 Michigan residents rely on the state’s behavioral health care system according to department data. This includes adults with serious mental illness, individuals with substance use disorder and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Having these services available ensures individuals can receive care, as opposed to ending up in the emergency room or jail, Stabenow said.
Rather than looking toward privatization, Stabenow said the state should look at providing more inpatient psychiatric beds for individuals who are severely ill, addressing gaps in the state’s behavioral health workforce and filling funding gaps for community behavioral health clinics.
Kevin Fischer, the executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Michigan, said an overwhelming majority of Michiganders who receive behavioral health services do not want them managed by a private entity.
If management for behavioral health services moves to a private model, Fischer said they are concerned that individuals would no longer receive whole-person care that goes beyond medication and therapy and includes community supports.
“The people who receive services understand the value of that whole person care. Private entities don’t value, and frankly don’t understand, that whole person care. That’s what we have to fight for,” Fischer said.

The presser occurred during the annual Walk a Mile in My Shoes rally, which for the last two decades has given people with mental illness, substance use disorders, or intellectual or developmental disabilities a chance to share their stories and raise awareness.
MI Care Council, a statewide group representing health care providers in Michigan, said Tuesday that it disagreed with the press conference’s injection of politics into a people-focused event.
“The Walk a Mile Rally is supposed to be about the people who want their voices heard, who want to end stigma, and who want to make sure behavioral care is accessible and prioritized in every community,” said Daniel Cherrin, executive director of the MI Care Council, in a statement. “And the people attending the rally, who want legislators to understand what it’s like to walk a mile in their shoes, should not be used to advance a political agenda they are not there to advance.”
Cherrin said that while advocacy in all forms should be supported, the rally was being “overshadowed by fear-based messages about privatization.”
“The state has made it clear: only nonprofits, public bodies, and universities are eligible to submit a bid,” Cherrin said. “This event should be about dignity, inclusion, and awareness. The people who walk each year deserve to know that their voices are being lifted for who they are, not used as part of someone else’s fight. We believe in a system that works better for families and providers alike, and we are committed to building it together.”

,DC,2025-09-18 16:06:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Permanent extension of federal health care subsidies estimated to cost $350 billion,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/permanent-extension-federal-health-care-subsidies-estimated-cost-350-billion,,"WASHINGTON — The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office announced Thursday that if lawmakers permanently extend the enhanced tax credits for certain people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, it would cost the government $350 billion over 10 years and increase the number of those with health insurance by 3.8 million.The 14-page letter from CBO Director Phillip L. Swagel to congressional leaders projected that extending the enhanced tax credits would reduce the average cost of gross premiums for benchmark plans by 7.6%.“The estimated decline in benchmark premiums is the result of the expectation that people enrolling in the marketplaces would be healthier on average if the expanded premium tax credit were extended,” Swagel wrote. The nonpartisan health research organization KFF writes on its website the “premium tax credit limits an individual’s contribution toward the premium of the ‘benchmark’ plan, the second-lowest cost silver plan in their Marketplace.”Congress taking action to extend the enhanced tax credits before the end of September, Swagel wrote, would lead 2026 premiums to decrease by 2.4% compared to previous projections.The enhanced premium tax credits, established by Democrats in 2021 as part of a massive COVID-19 relief package, were extended in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act. They are set to expire at the end of 2025.Extension late in the yearLawmakers taking action to extend the tax credits later in the year impacts CBO’s projections in two ways. “First, in CBO’s estimates, the likelihood that gross premiums for 2026 would be adjusted downward would fall to zero after the start of open enrollment,” Swagel wrote, adding that begins Nov. 1 in most marketplaces. “Second, the estimates would reflect a smaller likelihood that enrollees will see net premiums that incorporate the expanded credit structure at the time they select their marketplace plan (the net premium is the amount of the premium after accounting for the tax credit),” Swagel wrote. “CBO estimates that an enactment date later than September 30 would result in lower costs to the federal government and smaller increases in 2026 enrollment than those presented here.”This is relevant because the tax credits have become intertwined in debates on Capitol Hill over how to fund the government for a couple months as lawmakers try to complete their work on the full-year spending bills. While conversations about health policy and a stopgap spending bill would traditionally take place separately, concerns about prices spiking during the open enrollment period have merged the issues ahead of the Oct. 1 government shutdown deadline. Timing is crucial, Democrats say, since the open enrollment period begins on Nov. 1, well before the credits expire. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said earlier this week he views negotiations over the enhanced tax credits as “a December policy issue, not a September funding issue,” regardless of the timeline for open enrollment. Republicans, Democrats at oddsSenate Budget Committee ranking member Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., wrote in a statement the CBO letter shows “Republicans in Congress are driving costs up for working families. “That includes a huge increase in health care costs as they slash the tax credits that so many families rely on. It’s disgraceful, and only makes it harder for families to make ends meet. This is just more of their families lose, and billionaires win agenda.”Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, ranking member on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, wrote that “Americans already pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for health care. And it is going to get much worse. “Thanks to the massive cuts to health care in Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill,’ health insurance premiums will rise, on average, by 75% for 20 million Americans — all so Republicans could give massive tax breaks to billionaires and huge corporations. Working class Americans cannot afford that. These cuts must be rescinded.”House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, urged his party not to extend the enhanced tax credits in an op-ed published in the Washington Examiner on Thursday morning before the CBO letter was publicly released. “Despite Democrats designing these temporary COVID-19 credits to expire this year, they now not only want to extend them—they want to make them permanent,” Arrington wrote. “The truth is, even after the Biden COVID-19 credits expire, low- and middle-income families will continue to have access to affordable coverage. Obamacare's traditional tax credits will operate as designed.”",,,,2025-09-18 12:58:38.837735

The three-day event intends to usher in a 10-year effort to build prosperous communities in Southern states.
The plenary was moderated by Alaina Beverly, executive vice president of the Black Economic Alliance Foundation, and featured mayors from Jackson, Little Rock, Birmingham and Montgomery. 
“Our Southern cities are home to Black communities whose legacies have helped to shape this great nation and whose culture continues to drive it,” Beverly said, introducing the panel. “Our Southern cities are the proof point for ways in which innovation and investing in solutions to expand economic opportunity can be used by the entire country.”

Jackson Mayor John Horhn, who took office July 1, said the first thing he’s tackling is restoring trust with the taxpayers and county, state and federal governments. In recent years, the city of Jackson has dealt with maintaining the water system, retaining control of the Jackson airport and pronounced areas of blight.
“We also had an accountability issue of being able to get things done, so our focus is returning to basic services delivery and also coming with a plan of action so that we know where we’re going,” Horhn said. 
Horhn said the city needs to create a “Marshall Plan” — taking the name from a U.S. economic aid initiative intended to help Europe recover after World War II — for rebuilding, one that addresses blight, affordable housing and public safety.
“We’re looking for partners who can help us. If you have money, we have a problem for you,” Horhn said. “If you have an interest in putting resources somewhere, there is something in Jackson, Mississippi, that you can see.”
For his part, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott said his administration created programs such as BUILD Academy, a 12-week initiative that educates businesses and entrepreneurs on how to scale up their operations. He said Little Rock has focused on underserved communities, which has transformed neighborhoods and cemented partnerships, leading the city to become a leader in job growth.
“Transformation means that we all have to be unapologetic about doing things that weren’t done in the past and not care about the future, only focus on the present,” Scott said.

Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said local mayors need to get creative when thinking about the affordable housing crisis. According to Woodfin, in the last five years, the city has spent a little more than $16 million in critical repairs, new builds and down payment assistance for homebuyers, with $4 million of that provided by HOPE Enterprise Corporation. HOPE is a community development financial institution that aims to improve the financial well-being of underresourced communities in the Deep South. 
“We do that because it’s necessary. We do it because it’s the right thing to do, but we do it because we know it’s going to create opportunity and wealth for that new homeowner,” Woodfin said.
He also points to Birmingham Promise as an economic driver for wealth. The program provides tuition assistance for students who have graduated from a Birmingham school to attend any public two-year or four-year college or university in Alabama.
“When you graduate with a significant amount of debt from college, homeownership is probably not on your mind if your parents aren’t passing you the keys. This changes the game,” Woodfin said.
Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said partnering with HOPE to expand low-interest financing for small businesses has led to a major revitalization.
“It has helped us give the level of motivation to some of our entrepreneurs that they can do it, that we are truly investing in them and we’re willing to partner with them because that strengthens our economy, and overall that strengthens our community,” Reed said. 
DELTA FEST was co-created by HOPE Enterprise Corporation and Yancey Consulting, and featured speakers from financial institutions such as Wells Fargo and Capital One. Bill Bynum, chief executive officer for HOPE, said the organization has been providing support and services to under-resourced communities for more than 30 years, but the path to prosperity cannot be paved alone.
“We need an ecosystem. We need people who provide technical expertise, who can open doors for contracts, who can level the playing field in these communities, and we’ve been doing that,” Bynum said. 
He said he and other leaders noticed that communities across the Deep South were not prioritized when it came to federal and state resources, which led them to creating DELTA FEST. Part of DELTA FEST’s goal is to connect people who have big ideas for economic growth to organizations that can help get those ideas off the ground. 
“We want to create an economy across the Deep South that opens up doors for opportunity for everyday people, regardless of where they live, who their parents were, their gender, their race,” Bynum said. “If we don’t equip people to thrive, to prosper, then we are not going to realize our potential as a country, as a nation.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/17175821/Delta-Fest-12.jpg,,,2025-09-18 12:58:38.837735

The U.S. has not been in an economic recession since 2022. The last recession was in 2020, at the very start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group, is the only entity that officially declares the country is in a recession. An economic recession is a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy.
An NBER committee looks at data points like gross domestic product — the value of all the goods and services we produce — as well as trends in unemployment, personal income, consumption, industrial production and wholesales to determine the start and end date of a recession. 
The COVID-19 recession lasted two months, which makes it the shortest U.S. recession on record. The previous record was held by a six-month-long recession in 1980.

Two non-profits filed arguments with the Fourth District Court of Appeal last week, asking the court to reconsider a claim they filed in 2024 that the environmental impact report for the Hell’s Kitchen lithium mine near the Salton Sea neglects potential problems with air quality, water use, hazardous materials and tribal cultural resources.


Critics of a proposed lithium mine near the Salton Sea entered round two of their fight to force stricter environmental review of the project.
It’s the latest stage in a legal impasse over the massive lithium project. Environmental groups are trying to make sure nearby residents get the benefits of lithium production, while guarding against harmful impacts. The company says critics are using court challenges to stall an important energy project.
The nonprofits Comite Civico del Valle and Earthworks filed arguments with the Fourth District Court of Appeal last week, asking the court to reconsider a claim they filed in 2024, which a superior court judge dismissed earlier this year.

In their appeal filed Sept. 11, the groups argue that the environmental impact report for the Hell’s Kitchen lithium mine neglects potential problems with air quality, water use, hazardous materials and tribal cultural resources.
“The project would create a high-water demand in an arid desert environment where the drying out of the Salton Sea worsens severe air pollution impacts,” the brief stated.
Lauren Rose, a spokesperson for Controlled Thermal Resources, the parent company of Hell’s Kitchen, denounced what she called a “frivolous legal appeal.”
“This group’s ongoing actions are a clear abuse of the original intentions of (the California Environmental Quality Act) and only serve to delay progress on clean energy projects that are essential to the community, California, and the nation,” she said in a statement to CalMatters.
Hell’s Kitchen promises to unearth thousands of kilotons of lithium, a mineral essential to electric car batteries, cellphones and other electronics.  Officials with the nonprofits say they’re in favor of lithium production, but want to ensure it doesn’t compromise the health and environment of surrounding communities.
“We make the case that the project must be corrected to meet the standards that protect our community and our environment,” Luis Olmedo, executive director of Comite Civico del Valle, told CalMatters. “The lawsuit isn’t about stopping clean energy. We are for clean energy.”
The groups also released a report summarizing their call for heightened scrutiny of the project’s impacts. And they laid out demands that included creating a Lithium Valley joint powers authority with a local advisory commission, dedicating more of the state’s lithium extraction excise tax to areas closest to the project, and enacting an additional environmental mitigation fee on lithium produced there. 
Under the existing formula, Bombay Beach, a small hamlet on the Salton Sea near the project, would get $8,631 to offset impacts of the project, while larger areas such as El Centro, Calexico and Imperial would get six-figure payments.
READ MORE >>> The rotten egg smell at the Salton Sea isn’t just a nuisance. It can make people sick.
Bari Bean, deputy CEO of natural resources for Imperial County, said in a statement to CalMatters that the lithium tax formula is “a practical and balanced framework that considers both population size and geographic proximity to the lithium resource.” 
Bean said a joint powers authority would duplicate existing systems for community input. Imperial County wouldn’t support additional lithium fees, she said, since California already has stricter environmental protections than other states, “making development in California more challenging and often less cost competitive.”
State and federal officials have predicted that the area around the Salton Sea that they call  “Lithium Valley” could become one of the world’s biggest sources of the “white gold,” freeing the U.S. from dependence on other countries for the critical mineral.
Imperial County Supervisor Ryan E. Kelley said the project will advance both regional economic growth and U.S. energy goals.
“This initiative will position Imperial County as a leader in clean energy, contribute to California’s sustainability goals, and strengthen the United States’ critical mineral supply chain,” Kelley said in a statement to CalMatters. 
However, Rose said the ongoing court challenge has halted that momentum, and risks stalling lithium production in California.
“Just a few short years ago, Imperial County was leading the charge for clean energy and sustainable critical minerals development in the United States,” she said. “Now, billions of investment dollars have flowed to other states, including Nevada, Utah, Texas, and Arkansas, leaving California in the dust.”
Olmedo said his group has never called for injunctions against the project, but wants safeguards on its operations.
Hell’s Kitchen would extract lithium and other critical minerals from super-heated brine in the Salton Sea aquifer and then reinject the brine into the earth, in what the company calls a closed loop system that’s cleaner than other lithium mining systems.
Cal Poly Pomona Professor James Blair, an advisor to Comite Del Civico and member of Imperial County’s Lithium Valley Academic Taskforce, said the environmental review doesn’t prove that claim.
Blair said direct lithium extraction is framed as a “cleaner, greener method of lithium extraction compared to open mine or brine ponds,” but research on similar systems show that they use lots of fresh water. If that’s the case at Hell’s Kitchen it could worsen the decline of the shrinking Salton Sea.
“Novel technologies bring unknown results,” Blair said. “We don’t really know how much water is needed.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/021424-Hells-Kitchen-Lithium-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-18 12:58:38.837735

After many weeks of contentious bargaining, a Vermont bus workers union and a Massachusetts bus transportation company came to a tentative contract agreement Wednesday evening, narrowly averting a strike.
Teamsters Local 597, the union representing Vermont bus drivers and monitors serving the Windham Southeast Supervisory Union, planned to strike Thursday. This came after the bus company Travel Kuz — affiliated with Beacon Mobility — pitched a proposal that would remove worker protections to honor picket lines in other locations.
“The employer has withdrawn the last proposal and has agreed to maintain the status quo,” Teamsters Local 597 President Curtis Clough said.

Scott Sheridan, vice president of operations for Travel Kuz, wrote in a statement Wednesday evening that the company is “pleased to have reached an agreement for our valued employees and remain committed to providing safe, reliable transportation for our students, schools and communities.”
In August, contract talks broke down when the company locked out bus drivers and monitors to prevent them from working, and union members started picketing before the school year started. 
During the work stoppage, Travel Kuz brought in replacement workers to serve the supervisory union’s 10 schools in Brattleboro, Dummerston, Guilford, Putney and Vernon. The company accused Teamsters Local 597 workers of unlawful picketing and endangering students, which was disputed by the union president and law enforcement. Travel Kuz ended the lockout Sept. 2, and bargaining resumed. 
The tentative agreement, reached Wednesday, would ensure improved cost share for employees’ health insurance and the employer contribution to employees’ retirement accounts will double by the end of contract, Clough said. 
Union members plan to vote on whether to ratify the contract in the coming days, Clough said. 
Windham Southeast Supervisory Union Superintendent Mark Speno wrote in a Thursday statement that he is grateful that bargaining led to a tentative agreement between the parties, and the school community is ready to move forward. 
“We are happy to hear that negotiations have led to an agreed upon contract that we expect and trust will be ratified shortly,” Speno wrote.

“These are alarming figures,” NMDOH Harm Reduction Section Manager David Daniels confirmed to Source NM. The data compares July to September of this year with the same period as last year, he noted, and shows “this huge increase within these three counties.”
According to a news release, drug overdose-related emergency department visits also increased by 206%, 131% and 81%, respectively, in the three counties. Provisional data from the state health department shows the highest number of drug overdoses occurred among people ages 35 to 44 in Taos and Santa Fe counties; in Rio Arriba County, it was people 55 to 64 years old.
Males in Taos County increased the highest increase for overdoses, as did Hispanics. In Santa Fe County, white people experienced the greatest increase in overdose deaths. The report also notes that overdose counts have risen consistently for Santa Fe and Taos counties since the first quarter of 2024; that males in Taos County experienced the greatest increase; and Hispanic persons in Taos County and White persons in Santa Fe County experienced the greatest increases

New Mexico health officials said the majority of the fatalities involved fentanyl, and also noted that the department’s Adulterant Checking Program has detected increased concentrations up to 20% of fentanyl in fentanyl products versus the typical 1% usually found in samples.
The three counties all touch, Daniels said, “so we suspect that there may be increased fentanyl in the supply of the in the illicit supply that’s being received in these three counties.”
The department’s Adulterant Checking Program, which is about two years old, has four pilot sites that use “a portable FTIR mass spectrometer in combination with different test strips to analyze small samples of substances that people accessing harm reduction services have that they are either planning on using  or have used and have had unexpected experiences with,” the program’s technical advisor Phillip Fiuty explained to Source NM via email. The samples are then sent to a partner laboratory for secondary confirmation testing, he wrote.
For instance, in a testing report from March, the most recent available, 31 substances were submitted. Tests were performed to see if the drugs submitted were what people believed them to be: blue fentanyl pills; fentanyl power’ methamphetamine; heroin, Adderall, buprenorphine; crack cocaine and Lorazepam. Of the 10 fentanyl pills tested, only four contained fentanyl, while the samples contain two other opioids -heroin and carfentanil – as well as various opioid metabolites and precursors.
Daniels called the testing program a “lifesaver.” Before the program, he said, “we really did rely on the word of the client coming in” to know what the substances were. “With this testing machine, it gives us a lot clearer read of what’s being let loose out on the streets when it comes to illicit pills like this.”
Even before the data showed the surge in overdoses, Daniels said, the department was hearing reports from emergency rooms and from its harm reduction partners. In response, the state is emphasizing the availability of free medication (known as naloxone or Narcan) to reduce the effects of an opioid overdose, as well as medications for opioid use disorder. More information is available via the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-796-8773.
“I can’t stress our website (nmharmreduction.org) enough to get naloxone into people’s hands that need it,” Daniels said. “There’s many different ways that people can get naloxone. They can go to our public health offices. They can go to our contracted agencies. There’s vending machines in several communities in the state, and then also through our website. If you go onto that website, you’ll see in the upper right hand corner, you can click on that button, and you’ll be able to get Narcan delivered directly to your residence, free of charge, without stigma. No one needs to know that you even have this on you.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-609942630-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-18 15:58:46.165158

Males in Taos County increased the highest increase for overdoses, as did Hispanics. In Santa Fe County, white people experienced the greatest increase in overdose deaths.

New Mexico health officials said the majority of the fatalities involved fentanyl, and also noted that the department’s Adulterant Checking Program has detected increased concentrations up to 20% of fentanyl in fentanyl products versus the typical 1% usually found in samples.
“Opioid use impacts people and communities across New Mexico,” NMDOH Harm Reduction Section Manager David Daniels said in a statement. “We have contacted our partners in these counties to ensure they are raising awareness with their clients and reinforcing overdose prevention methods.”
An accompanying report on the data also notes that overdose counts have risen consistently for Santa Fe & Taos counties since the first quarter of 2024; that males in Taos County experienced the greatest increase; and Hispanic persons in Taos County & White persons in Santa Fe County experienced the greatest increases
The state offers free medication (known as naloxone or Narcan) to reduce the effects of an opioid overdose, as well as medications for opioid use disorder.

(Via Casey DeSantis Facebook, 2022)Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson announced a new rule Thursday demanding retailers of an increasingly popular herbal substance list how much of an opioid-like compound exists in each package.
The emergency rule will add yet another layer of security against the 7-OH compound in kratom products, a Southeast Asian plant known for its versatile opiate or stimulant properties.
Simpson’s announcement came one month after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier listed 7-OH as a Schedule 1 substance, placing it alongside drugs like heroin and LSD.
“We are filing a new emergency labeling rule that ensures that manufacturers and retailers can’t hide behind fake labels or misleading marketing,” Simpson said during a Jacksonville press conference. “Every product must clearly state the 7-OH concentration in parts per million.”
If the concentration is over 400 parts per million, the “gas station morphine” will be removed, Simpson added. The move is part of a broader Florida mission to eradicate kratom sales as a whole, and follows a 2024 law banning kratom for those under 21.
The main target is 7-OH, or 7-hydroxymitragynine. The guidance first came in July from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Food and Drug Administration with a report citing serious concerns with 7-OH’s ability to bind to opioid receptors. There are no FDA-approved 7-OH drugs, yet an estimated 16 million kratom users nationwide have generated more than $2 billion in retail sales, Medscape reported.
Two weeks later, Uthmeier derided the compound as 13 times stronger than morphine and promptly issued an emergency rule scheduling 7-OH as a highly illegal Schedule 1 substance.
An emergency rule lasts 90 days and must be taken up by the Legislature to become permanently part of Florida law.
“I want to thank the commissioner here and his law enforcement team for getting almost 18,000 products off the shelves that are dangerous,” Uthmeier said Thursday. “[But] this emergency rule is only good until the Legislature comes back to meet. … They’re the policy-making branch, and they can either ratify the rule, amend it, or impose restrictions at their discretion.”

Harris and his colleagues on the ADPH board discussed vaccine recommendations at its meeting Thursday ahead of a federal vaccine advisory panel. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)A north Alabama child who contracted measles is on the mend, and state officials said there was no transmission of the virus. 
The comments from Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama’s State Health Officer, came after a meeting of the Alabama Department of Public Health Thursday, in which officials stressed the importance of vaccination amid threats from diseases and federal policy changes. 
Dr. David Thrasher, a pulmonary physician based in Montgomery, said that vaccinating children is very important. If he had to choose one, he said, it would be the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

“Last year, seven anti-vaccine bills were proposed in the Legislature. I feel really good about going into this year, but I’d rather us not be, and Scott (Harris) particularly, being a lightning rod,” Thrasher said. 
Alabama has had one recorded case of measles this year amid a breakout in the United States. State health officials said the five-year-old child, who was not vaccinated, contracted the disease while on a trip. The child’s siblings were vaccinated against the disease, and state health officials have not disclosed the reason for the disparity. The child was not enrolled in day care, according to state officials.
It was the first recorded case of the disease since 2002.
Alabama Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said in an interview after the meeting the child is now fine and there have been no other cases reported.
“We’ve not found any evidence of transmission. This was a travel-associated case. It was somebody that came from an area where measles is endemic, and then came back to Alabama,” Harris said after the meeting. “We have a pretty good sense of how they were able to get it, which is different than a child in a day care who’s never left the state and got measles, which is a big alarm.”
Dr. Carrie Atcheson, a physician on the board, warned of the dangers of measles and her experience with an outbreak years ago in Washington state. 
“We couldn’t go anywhere,” Atcheson said. “We got a list in the paper of all the places where somebody who had measles had been, and it was basically everywhere public. It changes you.”
A federal vaccine panel, organized by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., met Thursday and is expected to delay a Hepatitis B vaccine for children. The panel will also make recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine for this fall. For now, Harris said, people should consult with their physicians.
“I think health care providers should definitely get the vaccine unless there’s some contraindication,” Harris said. “You’re working with vulnerable populations.”
Thrasher said of all the people at high risk of COVID, especially pregnant women, should get the vaccine.
“Of the women who are admitted between March and April this year, 30% of those were pregnant and those were unvaccinated. It’s the only way to protect that newborn,” Thrasher said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0441-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 11:59:16.353913

(Courtesy of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network)Almost four years ago, when Scarborough resident Shawna Ackley had her hands full chasing around her then three-year-old, the last thing she had expected was to get diagnosed with cancer at 38 with no known risk factors. 
She knows first-hand that life can be turned upside down in an instant, but she hopes there can be consistency for those accessing treatments as well as for researchers working toward a cure. 
“Health should not be about wealth,” Ackley said. 
Ackley was one of several Mainers associated with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network who met with Maine’s congressional delegation in Washington, D.C., this week to push for federal funding for cancer research as well as an extension of health insurance subsidies ahead of the September 30 deadline to pass spending legislation.
Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday released a short-term plan to fund the government until late November, but Democrats are holding out on demands that any spending extension address the expiring health care subsidies and roll back Medicaid cuts made in the GOP spending bill this summer. 
The group of advocates from Maine asked the state’s congressional delegation to back the highest possible funding for the government’s medical research institutions, to get a bill that would allow Medicare coverage and payment for multi-cancer early detection screening tests over the finish line, and to extend the subsidies. 
But the way Congress goes about addressing those demands also matters, they said. They warn that a short-term fix would cause harm to current and future cancer patients because of possible disruptions to affordable health care and research into the most effective treatments and side effect management. 
“What we want is a full-year funding bill,” said Topsham resident Mikala Bousquet, the organization’s lead ambassador for Maine. “We want there to be predictability, so that the market can make plans, that patients and families can make plans, that hospital systems can make plans.” 
Health care and research cuts so far 
Predictability has been upended under President Donald Trump’s second term. 
Millions of people are expected to lose health insurance as a result of the tax cut legislation Trump signed on July 4. The administration has also suspended and cut many National Institutes of Health and other federal grants, and has been slow to distribute funding for medical research that was congressionally appropriated for the fiscal year that ends this month. 
Many of the research cuts made by the Trump administration have been in pursuit of a goal to eliminate government waste and what the administration deems diversity, equity and inclusion programs. 
Trump’s big proposed cuts to health and education spending rebuffed by US Senate panel

A third-party grant tracking project reported that a DEI-related grant termination to Jackson Laboratory in Maine was sustained following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last month. The 5-4 decision allowed the Trump administration to cancel hundreds of millions of dollars nationally that were awarded by the National Institutes of Health.
Jackson Laboratory declined to comment on that grant termination, as well as the delayed disbursement of its NIH awards. Some other states’ institutions that have seen terminations of DEI-related grants have similarly been mum on the topic. 
Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has come under particular fire by many constituents for her approach to addressing funding cuts, though Jackson Laboratory has also repeatedly declined to comment on Collins’ performance. 
When Maine Morning Star spoke to voters this past spring, some criticized Collins for trying to reinstate cuts on an individual basis, arguing such an approach won’t be effective in deterring the president as he convoluted the federal government’s system of checks and balances. 
Collins has long been a vocal proponent of federal funding for medical research. But her ability to deliver on that front, among others, has been tested during Trump’s second term. 
Future access to care
As congressional committees have considered 2026 spending proposals, they’ve largely rejected Trump administration proposals to slash funding for medical research grants and health initiatives. Now the crux of debate to avoid a government shutdown has become the future of the enhanced premium tax credit that thousands of Mainers rely on. 
The tax credit, established during the COVID-19 pandemic and scheduled to expire at the end of this year, lowers the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the marketplace. In Maine, about 61,000 people are enrolled through the state marketplace, CoverME.gov.
Mills calls on Congress to extend tax credit to help Mainers afford health insurance

Ackley said early detection and access to timely care saved her life. Now, as Mainers and others across the country who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace face the possibility of steep cost hikes that could lead to an inability to afford coverage, she worries about late detection and postponed treatment. And, in northern Maine, costs can be even higher because of access issues in the more rural areas of the state. 
Ackley also knows from personal experience that the cost of cancer doesn’t end when active treatment ends, as oncologist visits, scans and bloodwork continue. “Survivorship is expensive,” she said. 
Bousquet, who is an oncology social worker, said her patients are already struggling with the cost of health care and cautioned against removing subsidies at a time when health insurance premiums are seeing sharp increases.
“Many of my patients, they get a diagnosis and they’re more stressed about the potential financial impact than they are the diagnosis,” she said. “It shouldn’t be that way. They shouldn’t have to be worried about that.”
When Bousquet was 20 years old, her mother died of metastatic breast cancer. Then, last year, her sister was diagnosed with cancer at age 29 and is still in active treatment. 
“All of the medications in her treatment regimen, every single one of the drugs that she’s on, is a direct result from NIH-funded research,” Bousquet said. 
In sharing her hope for her sister to have a long and healthy quality of life, Bousquet also cautioned that many of the lifesaving drugs she relies on have toxicities that aren’t yet fully understood. 
“We are still learning about those toxicities, and as such a young survivor, she will rely on research to make sure that she stays happy, healthy, and is able to cope with the effects of her treatment and her medications over time for a very long time,” Bousquet said.

That’s the way to Make Democrats Great Again, or so say the roughly eleventy-nine Democratic-allied centrist political action committees and think tanks, some old, many new, who promise they know how to right (pun intended) the ship and rebrand the Democratic Party.
Nevada U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto is heading up one of those groups, the Moderate Democrats PAC. That’s appropriate because she’s a one-time chair of the official PAC of Senate Democrats so she’s experienced at raising money. And when it comes to blind faith in moderation, you could say she’s a radical extremist.
Cortez Masto was momentarily and uncharacteristically trending this summer when she sparred with her Democratic colleague Cory Booker while working to pass a pair of “Police Week” crime bills supported by the entire Senate (including Booker; the whole thing was kind of  dopey). 
Alas, Cortez Masto’s long-held tendency to back all things cop notwithstanding, the Democratic Senate candidates her Moderate Democrats PAC is raising money for are still going to be called “soft on crime” or whatever in Republican attack ads. That’s just how it works.
And sorry, Nevada Democratic Rep. Susie Lee. Marching in lockstep with Fox alumnus celebrity and D.C. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro and being one of only eight House Democrats voting with Republicans to allow 14 year-olds to be tried as adults in Washington D.C. courts may have seemed like a politically prudent thing to do at the time. But it’s not going to stop Republicans from calling you a radical leftist criminal coddler, or words to that effect. In ads.
Cortez Masto and Lee, along with the rest of Nevada’s Democrats in Congress — Sen. Jacky Rosen and Reps. Dina Titus and Steven Horsford — have also voted for things like a fearmongering Trump bill to deprive immigrants of due process under the law. But Republicans are still going to say Nevada’s congressional Democrats “love open borders” because that’s how Republicans roll.
The newest entry in the organizational race to persuade Democrats to tack right and party like it’s 1989 is a think tank formed by Adam Jentleson, a former staffer to the late Harry Reid. Jentleson tells the New York Times that the “folks who are most to blame about Trump are the ones who pushed Democrats to take indefensible positions,” on contentious issues, especially LGBTQ+ ones.
Every Democratic politician in the country could stop talking about trans people this very minute. In fact, most of them already have. If they ever did. But guess what? Republicans are still going to squeal and scream that Democrats want, as Trump bizarrely puts it, “transgender for everybody.”
There may be some Democratic politicians who sincerely share Trump’s fever dream that “transgender for everybody,” whatever that is, is just around the corner. (Titus and Horsford don’t, by the way). 
There are probably also some Democratic politicians who share Trump’s desire to create a shoot first-ask-questions-later-if-ever police state. Or who applaud Trump’s zeal for wrecking not only lives but the economy by indiscriminately deporting people whose only crime was doing what it took to escape poverty and/or oppression.
But if Democrats believe refraining from opposing Trump on divisive socio-cultural issues will make people vote for them instead of Republicans, that seems problematic. 
Given a choice between a Democrat who has officially cried “uncle” in fear of Republican red meat attack ads and a Republican who keeps launching those ads anyway, it seems people who are moved by those issues will vote for the Republican.
Ye olde thought leaders
The centrist groups vying for Democratic thought leadership are defined almost exclusively by what they want Democrats not to do. 
As to what Democrats should do, the centrist group growth industry is fuzzy, collectively mumbling something about “kitchen table issues” and “common-sense.” 
Policies and positions reflecting such phrases and concepts were used again and again by Democrats on the campaign trail last year (as they are every campaign year). And they were voiced far, far more often than support for LGBTQ+ rights or sensible immigration reforms. The policy pitch by the centrist groups sounds a lot like the same old.
Which brings us to perhaps the one strategy in the moderate Democratic agenda, (in as much as there is either a strategy or an agenda) that might be loosely termed proactive: Reaffirm support for popular policies, especially health care policies, and hope that voters get sick of Trump’s economic shenanigans.
As rebrandings go, it’s sad-trombone soft and tiresomely derivative.
And it fails to address perhaps the biggest questions about next year’s elections: What exactly is the electorate anymore, and what does it want?
In polling both before and after the 2024 election, voters said their top concern was the economy.
A Fox News poll released last week found 52% of those surveyed said Trump is making the economy worse, compared to only 30% who said he’s making it better (let alone great again). Numerous other surveys also find Trump underwater on the economy
So maybe all Democrats need to do is vow to “fight” to protect health care provisions and programs, and then sit back while Republicans sink under the weight of Trump’s economic blundering. And then Democrats might at least take back the House in 2026 (assuming there will be an election), which is the first step toward overturning Trumpism in 2028.
But voter responses to pollsters about the economy notwithstanding, something other than the cost of things — and something other than immigration, and even something other than video of Kamala Harris saying “transgender” out loud, for that matter — was going on with voters last year. 
A sizable percentage of Nevada voters told pollsters they wanted to “tear down the system completely.”
Could the tear it down vote be potent enough to neutralize voters’ economic frustration next year? Especially if the economy merely limps along (as per some projections) instead of dropping into recession (as per others)?
Normally that would be unthinkable. But “normally” doesn’t exist anymore.
The evangelizers who swear that centrism will solve everything and the Nevada politicians who love them promise they’ll save the nation by embracing “mainstream positions” and “common sense.”
The last time voters in the nation and Nevada had a chance to express themselves, they elected Trump president. In other words, it’s anybody’s guess if Nevada’s congressional Democrats, and groups like Jentleson’s, have the foggiest idea what, if anything, passes for mainstream common sense anymore. 
What’s equally disturbing is how blithely they assume they do.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/centristheds-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-09-18 11:59:16.353913

NEWARK, Del. — September 2025 — Christ the Teacher Catholic School (CTTCS) has been named Delaware’s First State Favorite Community’s Choice Award winner for preschool, earning the distinction after months of public voting and a celebratory gala announcement.
Christ the Teacher has offered preschool education since the school’s founding in 2002, launching a full-time program more than seven years ago. Today, the school serves 100 students across its PreK-3 and PreK-4 programs and recently added a fifth pre-K class to meet growing demand. Class sizes are kept at state standards, ranging between 19 and 24 students.
The award-winning program is a curriculum-based learning experience designed to prepare young students for kindergarten and follows Delaware Standards. Christ the Teacher is the first Catholic preschool in the state to qualify under the Office of Child Care Licensing (OCCL) standards, ensuring a high level of quality and accountability. All teachers are certified instructors and are required to earn continuing education credits to maintain their credentials.
“We are deeply honored to receive this recognition,” said Ashley Torelli, Assistant Principal of CTTCS and head of the lower school, which includes Pre-K through 2nd grade. “Our preschool program provides a strong foundation where students learn, grow, and thrive in a nurturing, faith-based environment. We teach basic letter recognition, writing, and then build on that to help each student with reading preparation.  We also teach cursive, but not until 2nd grade.   This award reflects the dedication of our teachers, the support of our families, and the joy our youngest learners bring to our school every day.”
Christ the Teacher Catholic School offers classes from PreK-3 through 8th grade, blending academic excellence with Catholic values to help students flourish spiritually, socially, and intellectually.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)After a massacre in Charleston 10 years ago that devastated South Carolinians, faith leaders and elected officials immediately sought to ease public tensons and begin the healing process.
There were no riots, no cries of vengeance, no shouts of Civil War.
South Carolinians found hope and purpose in positive, unified action to lower the temperature and create a better state.
The aftermath of the mass shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church may offer a model for national reconciliation following the horrific assassination of conservative activist and author Charlie Kirk.
Ten years ago, on June 17, 2015, Dylann Storm Roof brutally murdered nine worshipers during a Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.
Only two days later, the families of the victims stunned the world by publicly forgiving the shooter. A secular America may not have understood this act of grace or may have seen it as too self-effacing. But the families are people of deep faith who affirmed forgiveness as a fundamental tenet of Christianity.
Thousands of Charlestonians, meanwhile, gathered for peaceful vigils and memorials.
Flowers, poems, and handwritten notes flooded the church steps, turning the site into a sacred space of remembrance.
Five days later, then-Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, held a press conference surrounded by a bipartisan group of state and congressional leaders, including Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, and declared that it was time to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse grounds.
This was bold leadership: Many viewed the flag as a symbol of hate and white supremacy, but many others cherished the flag as a representation of honor and heritage.
Bipartisan support for Haley’s proposal, however, was quick and decisive, and Haley signed the bill to remove the divisive flag on July 9, 2015.

Nine days after the shooting, then-President Barack Obama delivered a eulogy for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney at a funeral held for the Emanuel Nine in Charleston.
Many South Carolinians will never forget how Obama grieved with us, sought healing and even led those attending in soul-stirring “Amazing Grace.”
Our better angels
Both the Republican Haley and the Democrat Obama appealed to our better angels.
They led with love and dignity. Many South Carolinians remember their actions as among their finest moments of statesmanship.
They did not engage in violent rhetoric. They did not call for revenge. They did not crack down on free speech. They did not indict an entire political party or one side of the political spectrum for the insane acts of a hate-filled white supremacist.
Roof wanted to incite a race war, but Haley and Obama were determined to deny him that victory.
Tyler Robinson, the accused assassin of Kirk, could cause an ideological war, but extremists should not be allowed to drive us apart.
At least two lessons can be drawn from the aftermath of nightmarish incidents of gun violence. One is that principled, unifying leadership matters. Another is that the healing process is ongoing.
South Carolina leaders, for their part, have still resisted efforts to remove the so-called Charleston loophole that allowed Roof to purchase his murder weapon. The loophole allows a gun dealer to proceed with a firearm sale if the FBI’s background check isn’t completed within three business days.
The irony is dismaying: The state whose largest city gave the loophole its name has done nothing to correct the problem. Likewise, South Carolina’s murder rate and violent crime rate remain stubbornly high due to easy access to firearms.
But in one of the state’s darkest hours, two pillars of civil society — the church and state — worked together to tamp down anger and embrace the grieving.
Moving forward together
Can America’s faith communities and public leaders rise above the fray and heal the nation today? It does, after all, take more courage to unify than to divide.
One area of broad agreement could be mental health. More than 60% of Americans believe mental health should be a high funding priority for the federal government.
Commonsense gun regulation would be more controversial but would save lives.
Common ideas include universal background checks, domestic violence protection orders, red flag laws, licensing requirements for all gun purchases, safe storage laws, higher standards for semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, and ending the Charleston loophole nationwide.
It’s not certain that any of these initiatives would have prevented Kirk’s assassination any more than removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Statehouse grounds earlier would have prevented the Emanuel Nine massacre.
But these measures could unify Americans around a set of policies that may have saved at least some of the more than 19,000 Americans who died from gun violence in 2023 and the more than 10,000 who have died so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
We waste precious time and energy when we wallow in despair or shake our fists at our perceived enemies.
Like the faith leaders and public officials in South Carolina 10 years ago, Americans have the ability to create a safer society.

It was a passion, he said, that sometimes worked against Schmit, a farmer, lobbyist and businessman.

Schmit, a Republican who served in the officially nonpartisan Legislature from 1969 to 1993, is credited for legislation that built the state’s ethanol industry, which today is directly responsible for 1,800 high-paying Nebraska jobs and an economic impact estimated at more than $8 billion.
He fought the oil industry, which opposed the corn-based fuel, to get it done.
“I don’t think there would be an ethanol industry in this nation without him. He would just not give up,” said former State Labor Commissioner John Albin, whose late wife, Julie, was one of Schmit’s 10 children.
At the height of his political power in the 1980s, Schmit could make or break a bill, according to former legislative aide and ethanol industry colleague Pat Ptacek.
“If you got Loran on a bill, he could pull 12-15 votes on any given issue, because he worked with these people,” Ptacek said.
Schmit got bills passed to create the state’s expressway system, to allow physicians assistants to practice in Nebraska and to create the State Ombudsman’s Office and the Nebraska Department of Environmental Control. He pushed for higher-quality grain to increase international trade, and he took on the nation’s supermarkets, claiming they were involved in price fixing on meat, which hurt Nebraska’s cattle producers.
He also went against the grain of the state’s elite by supporting starting local option, slot-machine gambling operations, partly to reduce property taxes.
According to Albin, he had encouraged the Ak-Sar-Ben racetrack — which opposed expanded gambling back then for fear it would hurt racing — to install slot machines and help finance the track, but the track declined. Today, of course, the Ak-Sar-Bem racetrack is gone, and voter-approved casinos operate in five Nebraska racetracks. Some of the proceeds are being used to offset property taxes.
Schmit also took on the powerful in leading a 1988 investigation into the collapse of the Franklin Credit Union and the rumored involvement of several prominent Nebraskans in an associated child sex-trafficking ring.

A Douglas County Grand Jury investigated, concluding that the allegations were a “carefully crafted hoax,” and a federal grand jury also ruled later that the rumors were unfounded. In 1992, Schmit was defeated for re-election, ending his elected career.
“He thought that when little people were wronged, big people were behind it, and that made him some enemies,” said Moore, a former state senator and secretary of state who recently retired as an executive with Union Pacific.
Schmit’s second oldest son, Steve, said his father would have wanted to be remembered as a “friend” who stayed in touch with his constituents, attending many funerals and visiting many nursing homes.
“He never forgot where he came from,” the younger Schmit said. “When he talked to you, he was talking to you, not past you.”
David Ben Fischer, a former legal counsel to legislative committees headed by Schmit, recalled that the senator, like him, was an early riser.
“I’d get to the office by 6:30, and he’d already be there,” Fischer said. “The difference was I’d walked six blocks to get there, and he’d driven 60 miles (from Bellwood) after doing farm chores.”
In 1978, Schmit ran for an open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1st District against fellow State Sen. Doug Bereuter. Some considered Schmit the front runner, but his support dwindled after he became embroiled in a controversy over the hiring of his helicopter firm to dynamite ice jams on the Platte River. He lost the primary race by 3,200 votes.
In 1980, Schmit was inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Agricultural Achievement. Then Gov. Charlie Thone gave the induction speech, saying that the senator and farmer was proof “that one person who chooses to do so can make a difference.”
“He can, so to speak, beat the unbeatable foe. He can reach the unreachable star. He can make an entire nation, which is overly dependent upon foreign oil, stop in its tracks and examine an alternate idea such as gasohol,” Thone said.
Schmit had been in declining health in recent years but continued to lobby for the state’s ethanol industry for years after leaving the Legislature.
His body was donated to science, according to Ptacek, because of his commitment to physicians assistants. Funeral services are pending.

Read this story in English.
A primera vista, la ruta de uno de los proyectos de gasoductos más controvertidos de Estados Unidos podría parecer que no tiene mucha relación con Nueva Inglaterra.
Sin embargo, el gasoducto propuesto, de 200 kilómetros entre el yacimiento de esquisto Marcellus de Pensilvania y el norte del estado de Nueva York, forma parte de un esfuerzo de larga data para aumentar el flujo de gas natural a partes de Connecticut y, por extensión, a los estados vecinos de Massachusetts, Rhode Island y New Hampshire.
Estos esfuerzos han atraído recientemente el interés de un grupo de figuras políticamente diversas, como el Gobernador Demócrata Ned Lamont, el Presidente Republicano Donald J. Trump y el Secretario del Interior Doug Burgum, quienes consideran el gas natural una forma de reducir la carga del costo energético en la región.
Mientras tanto, los opositores argumentan que la construcción de un nuevo gasoducto solo agravará la contaminación y la liberación de gases de efecto invernadero que alteran el clima, y ​​que no contribuirá a reducir los precios.
¿Qué es el Gasoducto Constitution?
El Gasoducto Constitution está siendo desarrollado por Williams Companies, un importante operador de gasoductos en todo Estados Unidos. El gasoducto tendría capacidad para transportar hasta 650 millones de pies cúbicos de gas al día, según la compañía, suficiente para abastecer a unos 3 millones de hogares.
Williams recibió las aprobaciones federales para construir el gasoducto hace más de una década, pero el proyecto se estancó cuando el Departamento de Conservación Ambiental del Estado de Nueva York se negó a emitir un permiso de calidad del agua en 2016.
El proyecto continuó estancado hasta que los promotores volvieron a presentar solicitudes a los reguladores estatales y federales a principios de este año.
“Williams mantiene su compromiso de impulsar el proyecto del Gasoducto Constitution y ha presentado solicitudes de permiso a los reguladores de Nueva York y Pensilvania”, declaró la compañía en un comunicado este mes. “También seguimos trabajando con los estados, el Congreso y la administración para fortalecer los mercados energéticos estadounidenses, reducir los costos para las familias estadounidenses y apoyar el crecimiento económico a largo plazo”.
A la espera de dichas aprobaciones, Williams estima que la construcción del gasoducto debería comenzar el próximo año y entrar en servicio a finales de 2027.
¿Está Connecticut involucrado?
Si bien el gasoducto Constitution no transportará gas a Connecticut, su terminal en Nueva York se conectará con dos gasoductos existentes —los sistemas de Tennessee e Iroquois— que abastecen tanto al estado como a la región en general.
Según las autoridades, estos gasoductos ya operan a plena capacidad o cerca de ella, lo que crea un cuello de botella en el suministro, especialmente durante los meses de invierno, cuando el gas se utiliza tanto para calentar los hogares como para abastecer las centrales eléctricas que producen la mayor parte de la electricidad de la región.
Para reducir este cuello de botella, los operadores de gasoductos en Connecticut están desarrollando sus propios proyectos de expansión.
Los propietarios del gasoducto Iroquois, por ejemplo, buscan construir una serie de compresores que impulsarían 125 millones de pies cúbicos adicionales de gas cada día, lo que representa un aumento del 8.3% con respecto a su capacidad actual. Mientras tanto, la compañía energética canadiense Enbridge tiene sus propios planes para expandir su gasoducto regional, el Algonquin, para 2029.
Carolina Kulbeth, portavoz de Kinder Morgan, operador del gasoducto de Tennessee, declaró que ampliar la capacidad del gasoducto es fundamental para eliminar las restricciones existentes en el suministro de gas.
“La nueva infraestructura de gasoductos es la única manera de garantizar la fiabilidad y la asequibilidad en la región de Nueva Inglaterra, ya que la demanda sigue aumentando entre los clientes residenciales, comerciales e industriales”, declaró Kulbeth.
El propio Trump ha promocionado los beneficios del gasoducto, afirmando que reduciría los precios de la energía hasta en 5,000 dólares por familia en el noreste, cifras que, según los críticos, están exageradamente infladas.
“Les aseguro que Connecticut lo quiere y toda Nueva Inglaterra lo quiere”, declaró Trump en marzo. “¿Y quién no lo querría?”.
¿Qué tiene que ver con la energía eólica?
En mayo, Wall Street Journal informó que la resurrección del gasoducto Constitution estaba vinculada a las negociaciones entre la administración Trump y Nueva York sobre el destino de otro proyecto, Empire Wind.
Las autoridades federales retiraron los permisos para el proyecto eólico en abril, pero dieron marcha atrás casi al mismo tiempo que Williams volvió a presentar sus solicitudes para el gasoducto.
Si bien la Gobernadora de Nueva York, Kathy Hochul, ha negado haber hecho promesas explícitas de aprobar el gasoducto, ha expresado su disposición a colaborar con la administración y los promotores en “nuevos proyectos energéticos” no identificados que cumplan con la legislación estatal.
Sin embargo, Lamont ha insinuado firmemente que ambos proyectos están interrelacionados.
Después de que la administración Trump ordenara la semana pasada la suspensión de la construcción de otro proyecto eólico en marcha en New London, Lamont expresó su sorpresa por la decisión, dado su apoyo previo al desarrollo de nuevos gasoductos.
“Ya estamos manteniendo conversaciones muy productivas con la compañía de gasoductos Williams y los secretarios de Energía e Interior sobre cómo podemos traer fuentes de energía adicionales a esta región, incluyendo gas natural estadounidense”, dijo Lamont. “Así que no creo que haya un conflicto ahí”.
¿Qué dicen los opositores?
Quienes critican la expansión del gasoducto argumentan que proyectos como “Constitution” contradicen los compromisos asumidos por los funcionarios electos locales de reducir gradualmente la dependencia de la región de los combustibles fósiles. Connecticut, por ejemplo, cuenta con leyes que se comprometen a cubrir todas las necesidades energéticas del estado con fuentes libres de carbono a más tardar en 2040 y a alcanzar cero emisiones netas en toda la economía 10 años después.
Además, señalan los ya de por sí altísimos precios de la energía de la región, para argumentar que importar más gas natural no es una solución eficaz.
“No se trata de qué es mejor para el clima, el aire o los costos de la energía”, dijo Samantha Dynowski, directora estatal de Connecticut para el Sierra Club. “Se trata, ya saben, de los compinches de Trump, sus compinches en el sector de los combustibles fósiles”.
Durante su campaña presidencial del año pasado, Trump se comprometió a flexibilizar las restricciones ambientales y a aprobar nuevos proyectos de perforación, oleoductos y otros proyectos relacionados con los combustibles fósiles. Al mismo tiempo, intentó solicitar mil millones de dólares en donaciones de campaña a la industria del petróleo y el gas.
Proyectos de oleoductos como los de expansión de Iroquois y Algonquin también han enfrentado oposición local en Connecticut, particularmente en Brookfield, donde los residentes se han quejado de los planes para construir una nueva estación compresora cerca de una escuela secundaria.
El Departamento de Energía y Protección Ambiental de Connecticut anunció su aprobación provisional del compresor el 31 de julio.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s newly created public media entity will not lay off any employees, after enough workers opted to take voluntary buyouts, Pam Johnston, CEO of Rhode Island PBS and The Public’s Radio, said in an email to company employees Wednesday.
A copy of the internal email was obtained by Rhode Island Current.
“While the built-in waiting period included in the Voluntary Separation Program offered to staff is still open, we can now confirm that the program has achieved the savings necessary to close the $1.1 million budget gap caused by the elimination of federal funding,” Johnston wrote. “This means we will not have to move to layoffs at this time.”
The update comes almost a month after Johnston put employees on notice of potential staffing cuts, estimating a $1.1 million hole for the newly merged public media organizations due to congressional defunding. 
The loss of longstanding federal funding for public broadcasting, approved by Congress as part of the federal rescission package, came on the heels of renaming the new Rhode Island entity as Ocean State Media. 
The merger process began two years earlier, securing approval from state and federal regulators in the spring of 2024. Johnston, a Massachusetts broadcast veteran, was brought on as CEO in July 2024. At the time of the merger application, the company said it would have roughly 100 employees.
A spokesperson for Ocean State Media did not immediately respond to questions Thursday, including the total number of employees who took buyouts.
The Boston Globe Rhode Island reported that at least 19 workers across both outlets took the deal to leave, which offered three weeks of pay for every year with the company. Most employees who chose to leave were unnamed, though a few have been publicly identified. Michelle San Miguel, Rhode Island PBS Weekly anchor, announced her decision in a Facebook post, while Ian Donnis, The Public’s Radio political reporter, wrote in his weekly column that Sally Eisele, chief content officer, afternoon radio host Dave Fallon and health reporter Lynn Arditi took buyouts.
Johnston was scheduled to hold a staff meeting with company employees at 10 a.m. Thursday, according to her email.
“Transitions like this are never easy, but we move forward with clarity and purpose,” she wrote. “We have the creativity and vision it takes to not only fulfill our mission, but to reimagine how we serve our community in bold, innovative, and deeply local ways.”
Nationwide, public media outlets have been grappling with the fallout of federal funding cuts, which have provided a key source of money to public radio and broadcasting stations for nearly 60 years. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced it would be closing its doors by the end of the year due to eliminated federal funding.
Back in Rhode Island, at least two veteran TV journalists with ABC6 (WLNE) have lost their jobs as a result of its new service-sharing agreement with rival station NBC10 (WJAR). The deal lets Sinclair, the WJAR parent company, take over the equipment, operations and broadcasting for ABC6 but not the license — avoiding federal guardrails that prevent monopolies in local broadcast markets. Two ABC6 employees, meteorologist Kelly Bates and sports reporter Nick Coit, posted on social media that they were let go as part of the detail.
Sinclair has declined to comment on other layoffs or operational changes as a result of the agreement.

By Ryan Colasanti
The Milford Buccaneers will travel to Greenwood, Delaware, for a matchup with the Woodbridge Blue Raiders, Friday night.
The Buccaneers are searching for their first win this season after a tough two-point defeat to Conrad in their home opener and a road loss against Indian River last week. The Indians held Milford to just eight points a week after it scored 33 against the Red Wolves to begin the season. The Blue Raiders’ defense will present a similar challenge.
Woodbridge enters the game coming off a road loss to Sussex Central last week. Despite the loss, the Blue Raider defense came away with its second turnover in as many games proving to be an opportunistic defense. Woodbridge’s offense hasn’t quite got going early in the season, scoring 13 points through its first three games.
The Blue Raiders are 1-2 this season. Their lone win came two weeks ago at home against Wilmington Friends. The final score of the game was 7-6 in Woodbridge’s favor, courtesy of Malachi Hayes’ rushing touchdown and an extra point make from Evan Woodall.
The Blue Raiders historically come out on top in their matchups with the Buccaneers. Woodbridge has won four consecutive games against Milford starting after the COVID-19 pandemic. The last time Milford beat Woodbridge was at home in 2017.
The game is scheduled to begin at 7 pm on Friday at Woodbridge High School. Delaware LIVE will have coverage of the game with a story to follow on Saturday.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Milford-game-of-the-week-e1758205679390.jpg,,,2025-09-18 11:59:16.353913

The annual flu season starts each fall. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska had more influenza cases reported in the past year than in any of the three prior years, with severity that was worse than in those recent years, according to a new report from state health officials.
There were an estimated 11,900 lab-confirmed cases of influenza – commonly known as the flu – in the 2024-2025 season, which ran from last fall to this summer, said Carrie Edmonson, a state nurse epidemiologist and coauthor of a bulletin released this week by the state Division of Public Health’s epidemiology section.
There were 25 influenza deaths in the just-ended season, including the death of one child, according to the epidemiology bulletin.
In comparison, the 2023-2024 season had 10,200 confirmed cases and 10 deaths, all among adults, according to state records. In the season before, there were five influenza deaths in Alaska, according to state records.
The increases in Alaska are in line with national trends, the new bulletin said.
Increases in both cases and death totals could be at least partially attributed to better reporting, Edmonson said. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic lab reporting has been “enhanced substantially,” she said. “We are definitely getting a lot more cases reported to us.”
Additionally, she noted, the 2024-2025 season was classified as one of high severity nationally, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Nationally, the flu death toll last season hit a five-year high and exceeded that of the prior four seasons by a wide margin, according to the CDC.
As of May, the CDC estimated that there had been 47 million illnesses, 610,00 influenza hospitalizations and 27,000 influenza deaths nationally. The season’s toll as of May included 226 flu deaths among children, 90% of whom had not been fully vaccinated against influenza, according to the CDC.
In Alaska and elsewhere, the past three seasons were vastly different from the extremely low influenza numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there were widespread protections against that disease that spilled over into prevention of other respiratory infections.
“People were isolating substantially, people were masking, people weren’t going out, people weren’t traveling,” Edmonson said. And if people did get the flu then, their cases may have gone unreported because opportunities for in-person provider visits and lab tests were limited during the pandemic, she said.
Last season’s Alaska flu case numbers were highest in February and March, state records show. That contrasted with the previous two seasons, when the biggest flu months were either November or December. 
Most Alaska flu cases occur between October and May, but the timing of the annual spikes varies, Edmonson said.
One factor could be timing of vaccination, she said. Getting a vaccines early in the season may be less protective later, she said. “The vaccine wanes over time,” she said, and another factor could be timing of travel.
The overall effectiveness of last season’s vaccine, as calculated nationally, was 46.5%, the bulletin said. That rate is about typical for flu vaccines, Edmonson said.
Even if it is not close to 100% effective, the vaccine is worthwhile because it reduces the likelihood of illness, she said. Vaccinated people who do get influenza have protections that reduce illness severity, she added.
Many Alaska adults appear unenthusiastic about flu vaccines.
Last season, only 23.3% of Alaska adults were vaccinated against influenza, compared to a national rate of 46.7%, the bulletin said. Last season’s Alaska rates were typical for the state; only about one in four Alaska adults were vaccinated against influenza in the past few years, past epidemiology bulletins show.
Public health officials encourage all eligible Alaskans over 6 months in age to get a flu vaccine to prevent illness, and the shot can be administered along with other recommended vaccines like the COVID-19 and RSV vaccines.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250916_202121-1-1024x485.jpg,,,2025-09-18 10:56:38.478111

In this image, Benson tours the Wichita State University campus with other members of the Board of Regents in October 2024. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents answered political pressure to avoid aggressive 2026 budget requests for public universities and colleges by endorsing a plan calling for a $4.6 million cut from the current year’s state appropriation.
Blake Benson, chairman of the Kansas higher education board, praised the cooperative effort during the past three months to shrink the size of a preliminary version of the budget drafted in June. The final $1.1 billion budget outline recognized that massive, aspirational spending requests for higher education were unlikely to be warmly received by lawmakers during the legislative session starting in January, he said.
“The message was loud and clear that this budget needed to look much more like this,” Benson said. “The regents carefully evaluated our system’s needs and priorities and developed a request that meets those while remaining fiscally responsible.”
The state’s higher education system has continued to face financial pressure from rising operational costs and limited flexibility to respond to emerging needs.
John Dicus, a Topeka banker and member of the Board of Regents, said the budget plan was a collaboration among the Board of Regents, campus administrators, the governor’s budget director and Republican leaders in the House and Senate.
“This is something we tried to vet with them this year to make sure we got across the finish line,” Dicus said.
In a previous meeting on the budget, Dicus said overly ambitious spending proposals from college and university administrators could trigger further budget cuts. He said maintaining existing levels of state aid for higher education would be viewed as success in 2026.
The Board of Regents, with authority over 32 universities, community colleges and technical colleges, voted to ask the governor and legislators to invest $5.5 million in the Blueprint for Literacy next year. It’s a state-created program to overhaul K-12 reading instruction in Kansas to reverse student academic deficiencies.
The 2025 Legislature dropped funding for Blueprint for Literacy. Residual funding from an initial $10 million state appropriation for the program kept it from going dark.
“This is a nationwide problem and some states are putting in a lot more money than we do,” said Kathy Wolfe Moore, a former Democratic House member who was appointed to the Board of Regents in 2024. “We have to approve the Blueprint for Literacy and go after it with a vengeance in the state Legislature. This is foundational.”
The Board of Regents requested $15 million be invested in $5 million increments on energy research at the University of Kansas, Kansas State University and Wichita State University. KU would concentrate on energy production, while K-State would focus on nuclear power. WSU researchers would delve into alternative energy sources.
The proposed budget included $4 million each for the three smaller state institutions — Pittsburg State University, Fort Hays State University and Emporia State University.
Blake Flanders, president and CEO of the Board of Regents, said the budget included $16.3 million in ongoing support to recruit, retain and graduate students at technical colleges, community colleges and the universities.
The plan included $2 million to help with degree completion for Kansans with some college experience but no diploma. It contained $1.5 million for Washburn University to address workforce development.
He said the budget request recognized state tax dollars would need to be matched with $3 million or $4 million from the universities.
“We’re asking for a portion and a partnership,” Flanders said. “That’s a partnership that functions when both parties are participating.”
The comprehensive budget proposal for the fiscal year starting July 1, 2026, must be submitted to the governor’s office by Oct. 1. The Republican-controlled House and Senate would review and modify budgets for higher education, and the Legislature’s bill would be subject to line-item vetoes by the Democratic governor.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Benson-talking-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-18 09:56:42.182567

Modoc County, meet Marin County. It might be your new political boss. 
A ranching region along the Oregon border with just 8,500 residents, Modoc flies flags advocating secession from California. Now, if Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new redistricting plan goes through, Modoc would instead get pulled into the heart of liberal California. 
CalMatters political reporter Jeanne Kuang traveled to Modoc to speak with residents there, who say they’re most concerned Newsom’s Prop. 50 is a death-knell for rural representation. They told her their views on water, wildlife and forest management would be overshadowed in a district that includes Bay Area communities that have long championed environmental protection.

Nadine Bailey, an agricultural water advocate: “They’ve taken every rural district and made it an urban district. It just feels like an assault on rural California.”

Newsom’s proposal calls for splitting up the 1st Congressional District, which is comprised of 10 rural counties and is solidly Republican. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a rice farmer, would likely lose his seat. 
Here’s Jeanne:
Modoc County and two neighboring red counties would be shifted into a redrawn district that stretches 200 miles west to the Pacific Coast and then south, through redwoods and weed farms, to include the state’s wealthiest communities, current Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman’s home in San Rafael and the northern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, all in uber-liberal Marin County.

The ethnic studies classes that never happened

Right now, California’s high schools should be teaching a one-semester class focused on marginalized communities, thanks to a mandate passed by the state Legislature in 2021. 
However, that effort has been hindered by a lack of funding in the state budget and the Trump administration’s campaign against diversity and inclusion programs. 
As Carolyn Jones reports: 
The class was meant to focus on the cultures and histories of African-Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans and Latinos, all of whom have faced oppression in California. The state’s curriculum also encourages schools to add additional lessons based on their student populations, such as Hmong or Armenian. 

Albert Camarillo, Stanford history professor: “Right now, it’s a mixed bag. Some school districts have already implemented the course, and some school districts are using the current circumstances as a rationale not to move forward.”

California Democrats’ redistricting plan would split the state’s traditional Republican stronghold into a sprawling coastal district with Bay Area liberals. North State conservatives say it would silence rural voices.


Over several rivers and through even more woods, flags advocating secession from California flutter above hills dotted with cattle, which outnumber people at least sixfold.
This ranching region with a libertarian streak might have more in common with Texas than the San Francisco Bay Area. 
But it’s not Texas. Five hours northeast of Sacramento on an easy day, Modoc County and its roughly 8,500 residents are still — begrudgingly — in California. 
And California is dominated by Democrats, who are embroiled in a tit-for-tat redistricting war with the Lone Star State that will likely force conservative Modoc County residents to share a representative in Congress with parts of the Bay Area. 
Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing to split up the solidly Republican 1st Congressional District covering 10 rural, inland counties in the North State as part of his plan to create five more Democratic seats to offset a GOP-led effort to gain five red seats in Texas. 
That would mean Republican Doug LaMalfa, the Richvale rice farmer who represents the district, would likely lose his seat. 
Modoc County and two neighboring red counties would be shifted into a redrawn district that stretches 200 miles west to the Pacific Coast and then south, through redwoods and weed farms, to include some of the state’s wealthiest communities, current Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman’s home in San Rafael and the northern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, all in uber-liberal Marin County. 
“It’s like a smack in the face,” said local rancher Amie Martinez. “How could you put Marin County with Modoc County? It’s just a different perspective.”

The proposal would even likely force Modoc residents to share a district with the governor, who moved back to Marin County last year and splits his time between there and Sacramento. Modoc County voted 78% in favor of recalling him, and voters asked about redistricting there view it as a publicity stunt for Newsom’s presidential ambitions.
The ballot measure known as Proposition 50, on voters’ ballots Nov. 4, has sparked outrage in the North State. Yet for a region known for its rebellious spirit, residents are also resigned: they know they’re collateral damage in a partisan numbers game.
The map would dilute conservative voting power in one of the state’s traditional Republican strongholds. It would cut short the career growth of politicians from the state’s minority party and make room for the growing cadre of Democrats rising up from state and county seats, jockeying for bigger platforms.

But locals say they’re most concerned it’s a death-knell for rural representation. They worry their agricultural interests and their views on water, wildlife and forest management would be overshadowed in a district that includes Bay Area communities that have long championed environmental protection.
“They’ve taken every rural district and made it an urban district,” said Nadine Bailey, a former staffer for a Republican state senator who now advocates for agricultural water users and the rural North State. “It just feels like an assault on rural California.”
Though Modoc County supervisors have declared their opposition to Prop. 50, there’s little else locals can do. Registered Republicans are outnumbered by Democrats statewide nearly two-to-one. Rural residents represent an even smaller share of the state’s electorate. 
“It’ll be very hard to fight back,” said Tim Babcock, owner of a general store in Lassen County, a similar and neighboring community that’s proposed to be drawn into a different liberal-leaning congressional district. “Unless we split the state. And that’s never going to happen.”
An isolated county
Far-flung but tight-knit, the high desert of Modoc County has been an agricultural community for generations. 
In the west, cattle graze through a series of meadows and valleys into the hills of the Warner Mountains. Hundreds of them are sold weekly at an auction yard Martinez’s family runs on the outskirts of Alturas. The 3,000-person county seat consists of a cluster of government buildings, a high school and empty storefronts. In the east, migratory birds soar over vegetable farms on the drained Tule Lake bed that the U.S. granted to World War II veteran homesteaders by picking names out of a pickle jar. Not far away sit the remains of an internment camp where the government imprisoned nearly 19,000 Japanese Americans. 
The sheer remoteness and harsh natural beauty are a point of pride and a source of difficulty. Residents live with the regular threat of wildfires. A fifth of the county’s residents live below the poverty line. There’s no WalMart and no maternity ward, and there are few jobs outside of agriculture. Like other forested counties, local schools are facing a fiscal cliff after Congress failed to renew a source of federal funding reserved for areas with declining timber revenues.

It’s so sparsely populated that local Republican Assemblymember Heather Hadwick, who lives in Modoc County, represents 10 neighboring counties besides her own. She puts in hundreds of miles on the road holding town halls between Sacramento and home, and struggles to imagine a congressmember reaching her county, with winding roads and the Klamath Mountains between Modoc and the coast.
“It’s just not good governance,” she said.
Modoc County went for Trump by over 70% last fall. Its sheriff, Tex Dowdy, proudly refuses to fly the California flag over his station out of grievance with the state’s liberal governance. In 2013, Modoc made headlines for declaring its intent to secede from California and form the “State of Jefferson” with neighboring counties in the North State and southwest Oregon.
County Supervisor Geri Byrne said she knew it was a longshot — but thought, “when’s the last time The New York Times called someone in Modoc County?”
Byrne, who is also chair of the Rural County Representatives of California and of the upcoming National Sheepdog Finals, said the secession resolution was about sending a message.
“It wasn’t conservative-liberal,” she said. “It was the urban-rural divide, and that’s what this whole Prop. 50 is about.”
Even a Democratic resident running a produce pickup center in Alturas observed that her neighbors are “not that Trumpy.” Instead, there’s a pervasive general distrust of politics on any side of the aisle.
In particular, residents who live by swaths of national forests bemoan how successive federal administrations of both parties have flip-flopped on how to manage public lands, which they say have worsened the risk of wildfire and prioritized conservation over their livelihoods.
Flourishing wolves are a problem
At the moment, all anyone can talk about is the wolves. 
The apex predator returned to California more than a decade ago, a celebrated conservation success story after they were hunted to near-extinction in the western U.S. Now they’re flourishing in the North State — and feeding on cattle, throwing ranching communities on edge. Federally, they’re still listed as an endangered species under the landmark conservation law signed by President Richard Nixon. 
Under California rules, ranchers can only use nonlethal methods to deter the wolves, like electrifying fencing or hiring ranch hands to guard their herds at night.

“That whole issue is softened by the organizations that mean well for the animals, but this is our absolute existence here,” said Teri Brown, owner of a local feed store, who said she’s had cows go missing that she suspects were killed by wolves. 
It’s one of the rural issues Brown, a registered Republican, said voters closer to the Bay Area wouldn’t understand. She said she doesn’t support gerrymandering anywhere — in Texas or California. 
In town to visit his bookkeeper, rancher Ray Anklin scrolled through his phone to show videos of wolves trotting through his property and grisly photos of calf kills. He said last year, wildlife killed 19 of his cattle — a loss of over $3,000 per head. He’s set up a booth at a nearby fair, hoping to get public support for delisting wolves as an endangered species, and wants any representative in Congress to take the issue seriously.
As California’s battlegrounds increasingly take shape in exurban and suburban districts, rural North State conservatives at times feel almost as out of touch with their fellow Republicans as they do with Democrats. 
Few Republicans in the state and nation understand “public lands districts,” said Modoc County Supervisor Shane Starr, a Republican who used to work in LaMalfa’s office. “Doug’s the closest thing we’ve got.”

“This whole thing with DEI and ‘woke culture’ and stuff,” he said, referring to the diversity and inclusion efforts under attack from the right, “it’s like, yeah, we had a kid who goes to the high school who dyed his hair a certain color. Cool, we don’t care. All of these things going on at the national stage are not based in our reality whatsoever.”
At a cattlemen’s dinner in Alturas one recent evening, Martinez said she once ran into LaMalfa at a local barbecue fundraiser for firefighters and approached him about a proposal to designate parts of northwestern Nevada as protected federal wilderness. Her 700-person town of Cedarville in east Modoc County is 10 minutes from the state line.
Martinez worried about rules that prohibit driving motorized vehicles in wilderness, which she said would discourage the hunters who pass through during deer season and book lodging in town. Even though the proposal was in Nevada, LaMalfa sent staff, including Starr, to meetings to raise objections on behalf of the small town, she said. 
“I know we won’t get that kind of representation from Marin County,” she said.
Reached by phone, Huffman defended his qualifications to represent the region. 
Adding Siskiyou, Shasta and Modoc counties would mean many more hours of travel to meet constituents, but Huffman pointed out his district is already huge, covering 350 miles of the North Coast. And it includes many conservative-leaning, forested areas in Trinity and Del Norte counties. A former attorney for the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, he’s the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, where LaMalfa also sits.

Huffman said he would run for re-election in the district if voters approve its redrawing, and “would work my tail off to give them great representation.”
As for the wolves, he doesn’t support delisting their endangered status and said he only supports nonlethal methods of managing the population. 
“There are plenty of win-win solutions,” he said of conflict between ranchers and environmentalists. “I’m not an absolutist. I’m a problem solver.”
For Democrats, ‘I don’t think there’s any option’
On the other side of the aisle, North State Democrats are gearing up to support Prop. 50, even as parts of it make them uneasy. 
Nancy Richardson, an office manager at the free weekly paper in Modoc County (coverage of high school sports remains steady, along with a police blotter announcing a woman’s booking for eavesdropping), said she doesn’t like that it will cost the state as much as $280 million to run the statewide election on redistricting. 
But she thinks it has to be done. 
“I don’t like that Texas is causing this problem,” she said.
In Siskiyou County’s liberal enclave of Mt. Shasta, Greg Dinger said he supports the redistricting plan because he wants to fight back against the Trump administration’s targeting of immigrants, erosion of democratic norms and a federal budget that is estimated to cut $28 billion from health care in California over the next 10 years. 
The effects are expected to be particularly acute in struggling rural hospitals, which disproportionately rely on Medicare and Medicaid funding. LaMalfa voted for the budget bill.
Dinger, who owns a web development company, said normally he would only support bipartisan redistricting. But he was swayed by the fact that Trump had called for Republicans to draw more GOP seats in Texas. 
“Under the circumstances, I don’t think there’s any option,” he said. “There’s the phrase that came from Michelle Obama, ‘When they go low, we go high.’ Well, that doesn’t work anymore.”
In an interview, LaMalfa said the impacts to rural hospitals were exaggerated. He blamed impending Medicaid cuts instead on California’s health care system being billions of dollars over budget this year, in part because of rising pharmaceutical costs and higher-than-expected enrollment of undocumented immigrants who recently became eligible. (California doesn’t use federal dollars to pay for undocumented immigrants’ coverage.)
“Basically what it boils down to is they want illegal immigrants to be getting these benefits,” he said in response to criticism of the spending bill. “Are the other 49 states supposed to pay for that?”
LaMalfa has criticized Prop. 50 and said no state should engage in partisan redistricting in the middle of the decade. But he stopped short of endorsing his Republican colleague Rep. Kevin Kiley’s bill in Congress to ban it nationwide, saying states should still retain their rights to run their own elections systems. 
The proposed new maps would make Kiley’s Republican-leaning district blue. They would turn LaMalfa’s 1st District into a dramatically more liberal one that stretches into Santa Rosa. 
But LaMalfa said he’s leaning toward running for re-election even if the maps pass, though he’s focused for now on campaigning against the proposition. 
“I intend to give it my all no matter what the district is,” he said. 
He would likely face Audrey Denney, a Chico State professor and two-time prior Democratic challenger who has already said she’d run again if the maps pass. Outgoing state Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, a Healdsburg Democrat who was instrumental in coming up with the proposed new maps, is also reportedly interested in the seat; McGuire’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
In her renovated Queen Anne cottage in downtown Chico, Denney buzzed with excitement describing how the proposition has galvanized rural Democrats. 
She emphasized her own family’s roots as ranchers in the Central Coast region, and said she has bipartisan relationships across the North State.

“I have credibility in those spaces, growing up in rural America and spending my career advocating for rural America and real, actual, practical solutions for people,” she said. 
Denney’s former campaign staffer Rylee Pedotti, a Democrat in Modoc County, shares her optimism — to an extent. A communications professional whose family also owns a ranch, she said she’s not worried Huffman couldn’t represent Modoc. 
“More often than not we actually do experience some of the same issues,” Pedotti said: water and irrigation concerns, the loss of home insurance, the rising costs of health care.
Yet she’s deeply conflicted about the proposal: on the one hand cheering Democrats for being “finally ready to play hardball as the Republicans have done so well for decades in consolidating power;” on the other fearful of the escalating partisan rancor and the disenfranchisement of her neighbors. She’s considering sitting out the election.
“We’ll still be heard,” she said, if the new maps pass. “But I understand the concerns of folks who are on the other side of the aisle. It feels like their voice is being taken away.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090425-Redistricting-Modoc-County-MG-CM-43.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958

The ethnic studies class was meant to focus on the cultures and histories of African-Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans and Latinos. The state’s curriculum also encourages schools to add additional lessons based on their student populations, such as Hmong or Armenian. 


This fall, every high school in California was supposed to offer ethnic studies — a one-semester class focused on the struggles and triumphs of marginalized communities. 
But the class appears stalled, at least for now, after the state budget omitted funding for it and the increasingly polarized political climate dampened some districts’ appetite for anything that hints at controversy.
“Right now, it’s a mixed bag. Some school districts have already implemented the course, and some school districts are using the current circumstances as a rationale not to move forward,” said Albert Camarillo, a Stanford history professor and founder of the university’s Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. “But I’m hopeful. This fight has been going on for a long time.”
California passed the ethnic studies mandate in 2021, following years of debate and fine-tuning of curriculum. The class was meant to focus on the cultures and histories of African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans and Latinos, all of whom have faced oppression in California. The state’s curriculum also encourages schools to add additional lessons based on their student populations, such as Hmong or Armenian. 
The course would have been required for high school graduation, beginning with the Class of 2030. 
But the state never allotted money for the course, which meant the mandate hasn’t gone into effect. The Senate Appropriations Committee estimated that the cost to hire and train teachers and purchase textbooks and other materials would be $276 million. Some school districts have used their own money to train teachers and have started offering the class anyway.
Accusations of antisemitism
Meanwhile, fights have erupted across the state over who and who isn’t included in the curriculum. Some ethnic studies teachers incorporated lessons on the Gaza conflict and made other changes put forth by a group of educators and activists called the Liberated Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Consortium. That’s led to accusations of antisemitism in dozens of school districts.
Antisemitism has been on the rise generally in California, not just in schools. Statewide, anti-Jewish hate crime rose 7.3% last year, according to the California Department of Justice. In Los Angeles County, hate crimes — including slurs— against Jewish people rose 91% last year, to the highest number ever recorded, according to the county’s Commission on Human Relations.
Those numbers in part prompted a pair of legislators to propose a bill addressing antisemitism in California public schools. Assembly Bill 715, which is now headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom, would beef up the discrimination complaint process in schools and create a statewide antisemitism coordinator to ensure schools comply. Another bill, which died, would have directly addressed antisemitism in ethnic studies classes by placing restrictions on curriculum.
‘On life support’
But the delays and public controversies have taken a toll. No one has tracked how many schools offer ethnic studies, or how many require it, but some say the momentum is lost.
“It’s already on life support and this could be one more arrow,” said Tab Berg, a political consultant based in the Sacramento area. 
Berg has been a critic of ethnic studies, saying it’s divisive. A better way to encourage cultural understanding is to eliminate segregation in schools and ensure the existing social studies curriculum is comprehensive and accurate, he said. “We should absolutely find ways to help students appreciate and understand other cultures. But not in a way that leads to further polarization of the school community.”
Carol Kocivar, former head of the state PTA and a San Francisco-based education writer, also thinks the class may be stalled indefinitely.
 “I think the people who supported ethnic studies didn’t realize they were opening a can of worms,” Kocivar said. “Until there’s an agreement on the ideological guardrails, I just don’t see it moving forward on a broad scale.”
Kocivar supports the ethnic studies curriculum generally, but thinks it should be woven into existing classes like English, history and foreign language. That would leave room in students’ schedules for electives while still ensuring they learn the histories of marginalized communities.
Schools moving ahead 
In Orange County, nearly all high schools are offering ethnic studies as a stand-alone elective course or paired with a required class like English or history. Teachers use curriculum written by their districts with public input, drawn from the state’s recommended curriculum. They also have the option of adding lessons on Vietnamese, Hmong or Cambodian culture, reflecting the county’s ethnic makeup.
“The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Marika Manos, manager of history and social science for the Orange County Department of Education. “Students see themselves in the curriculum and in the broader story of America. … It’s a wonderful opportunity for them to get some joy in their day.”
A handful of districts are waiting to see if the state authorizes funding, but the rest have found their own money to hire and train teachers and purchase materials. There was some pushback against Santa Ana Unified when two Jewish civil rights groups sued, claiming the district’s ethnic studies courses contained antisemetic material. The district settled earlier this year and changed the course curriculum.
Polarized political climate
Camarillo, the Stanford professor, said the national political climate “no question” has had a significant effect on the ethnic studies rollout. Parents might have genuine concerns about what’s being taught, “but we’re also seeing the impact of extremist groups that are fomenting distrust in our schools.”
He pointed to book bans, attacks on “woke” curriculum and other so-called culture war issues playing out in schools nationwide. 
But the fight over ethnic studies has been going on for decades, since the first student activists pushed for the course at San Francisco State in the 1960s, and he’s hopeful that the current obstacles, especially the fights over antisemitism, will eventually resolve.
“I hate to see what’s happening but I think there’s hope for a resolution,” he said. “Ethnic studies can help us understand and appreciate each other, communicate, make connections. I’ve seen it play out in the classroom and it’s a beautiful thing.”
‘A really special class’
In Oakland, Summer Johnson has been teaching ethnic studies for three years at Arise High School, a charter school in the Fruitvale district. She uses a combination of liberated ethnic studies and other curricula and her own lesson plans. 
She covers topics like identity, stereotypes and bias; oppression and resistance; and cultural assets, or “the beautiful things in your community,” she said. They also learn the origins of the class itself, starting with the fight for ethnic studies at San Francisco State.
Students read articles and write papers, conduct research, do art projects and give oral presentations, discuss issues and take field trips. She pushes the students to “ask questions, be curious, have the tough conversations. This is the place for that.”
She’s had no complaints from parents, but sometimes at the beginning of the semester, students question the value of the class. 
“When that happens, we have a discussion,” Johnson said. “By the end of the class, students learn about themselves and their classmates and learn to express their opinions. Overall students respond really well.”
Johnson, who has a social studies teaching credential, sought out training to teach ethnic studies and feels that’s critical for the course to be successful. Teachers need to know the material, but they also need to know how to facilitate sensitive conversations and encourage students to open up to their peers.
“It’s a really special class. I’d love to see it expand to all schools,” Johnson said. “The purpose is for students to have empathy for each other and knowledge of themselves and their communities. And that’s important.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/032823_EthnicStudies_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958
,California,2025-09-18 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,‘These are not normal times’: Why Alex Padilla changed his tune on nonpartisan redistricting,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/alex-padilla-congress-midterm-redistricting/,"Sen. Alex Padilla says ""there's too much at stake"" for Democrats to remain idle in a political arms race between red and blue states. Meanwhile, he plans to introduce legislation that would establish independent redistricting commissions in every state.","As a United States senator, Alex Padilla does not have much personally at stake in the congressional redistricting skirmish now sweeping through Texas, California and potentially other parts of the union. He represents a whole state, the nation’s most populous, so district boundaries do not affect his electorate.
But Padilla, a quietly influential member of his party and of the Senate, is invested in the struggle for power and advantage underway in Washington. He is a committed critic of President Donald Trump. Padilla’s attempts to stand up for the immigrants who undergird the life and culture of California crested in a memorable confrontation earlier this year when he showed up at a news conference hosted by Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem, only to be wrestled to the ground by federal officers.
The incident was captured on video and stands as one of the hallmark moments of the Trump regime’s dubious resort to force as it stampedes through American cities, rounding up people who look Latino and shipping them off to faraway lands. 
Padilla has supported independent redistricting commissions in the past and backed the current structure in California, which was built to minimize partisanship in the business of drawing lines for members of Congress and others. But now, as Trump and his allies work to game the nation’s politics, Padilla is a supporter of California’s proposed response.
He is backing Proposition 50, which will appear on a special election ballot in November and would redraw California’s congressional maps to give Democrats the advantage in five more races. That’s a direct response to Texas, which, under instructions from Trump, has approved new maps that draw five seats in that state with Republican majorities.
This is politics, not math, so none of these schemes are foolproof. Even if the new maps go into effect, actual candidates need to run and win, and voters have a way of foiling the best-laid plans. But tilting majorities is intended to shape the field for the party doing the drawing.
In “normal times,” Padilla told me this week when we met in his Capitol Hill hideaway off the Senate floor, he would support nonpartisan commissions and that redistricting take place once every 10 years, in conjunction with the census. “But these are not normal times. There’s too much at stake.”
For Padilla, this is about more than voting systems or niceties. It’s about climate change, immigration, access to health care — the full panoply of assaults that the Trump administration has waged and that it intends to sustain by holding the House of Representatives in the midterms. It’s a goal so important that the administration has made clear it’s willing to cheat to achieve it.
Notably, Padilla said, the administration is not attempting to do that by trumpeting its record since taking office in January. Trump and his allies enjoy a rare moment of dominance in the nation’s life, holding the presidency, both houses of Congress and, in effect, the Supreme Court, which has regularly avoided direct confrontations with the president by giving him what he wants — even when it stretches logic and constitutional norms, as it did on abortion and presidential immunities.
The administration could run on its record, Padilla said, but that record is, by every measure, deeply unpopular. Most voters object to the substance of Trump’s signature legislative achievement, his so-called Big Beautiful Bill, with its cuts to medical and health services in order to pay for tax cuts for the very wealthy.
And voters also have registered their discomfort with Trump’s militarized sweeps through American cities, starting with Los Angeles, in order to deport gardeners and nannies and other working men and women under the guise of targeting dangerous criminals. As of this week, 39% of voters say they approve of Trump’s job performance, compared to 57% who disapprove, the lowest point of his presidency. And Trump’s support from Latinos, which surprised many analysts during the election, is falling. 
That leaves Trump and his allies in a quandary, Padilla argued.
“The only hope they have to stay in power after the midterms is to rig them,” he said.
That has touched off the rush to redistrict, first by Texas and then by others. Padilla said he’s convinced that the push would not have stopped with Texas, and that necessitated California’s response. In any case, he said, it’s required if liberal states have any hope of holding their own against conservative line-drawing.
Underscoring that point, the senator is today introducing a new bill, the Redistricting Reform Act of 2025. It would bar states from redistricting mid-decade unless ordered by a court, and it would require states to create an independent redistricting commission to supervise the drawing of congressional lines. That would end the arms race now underway, but it will surely draw opposition — let alone go anywhere in a Republican-controlled Congress — since it would strip redistricting away from legislatures and governors eager to use it to gerrymander lines.
It was the immigration roundups that prompted Padilla to show up unannounced at Noem’s June press conference in Los Angeles. When he tried to ask a question, FBI agents tackled him to the ground. She claimed to have felt threatened by him, but video recordings of the incident make clear he never got close. He is a United States senator after all, asking a question of a cabinet officer, for which he was manhandled and detained.
Dismissing the incident a few days later, Vice President J.D. Vance referred to the senator as “Jose” Padilla, a remark that could only be heard as a racial slur. I’ve known Padilla a long time, since his days as a Los Angeles City Council member. It’s clear how much the confrontation with Noem and the disrespect by Vance affected him.
And so the partisanship, the invective, the smuggery that Trump has brought to the White House continues to erode efforts at moderation. Now it forces Democrats, including Padilla, into an uncomfortable position: Do they stand by nonpartisan districting commissions and let Trump rig the system in Texas and elsewhere, or do they stoop to his level and jimmy districts in the states that they control?
I suggested to Padilla that the old maxim “two wrongs don’t make a right” might be appropriate here. He politely disagreed.
“Two wrongs don’t necessarily make a right,” he acknowledged, “but in this case, one wrong could be disastrous.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/081425_Redistricting-Rally_TS_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958

It’s a bad deal for Minnesotans, and would set a precedent for other private equity firms to buy utilities. The alleged benefits are not backed up. 
Minnesota Power serves 150,000 electric customers across northeast and north central Minnesota.
The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has the final say on the sale. 
As is common practice, the PUC asked an administrative law judge to hold a contested case hearing, where advocates argued the sale’s pros and cons. In the end, The administrative law judge wrote a report to the PUC with findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations. 
Administrative Law Judge Megan McKenzie’s conclusion could not be clearer. The sale: “would result in net harm to the public interest.”
Will the PUC listen?
The PUC is charged with improving “the lives of all Minnesotans by ensuring safe, reliable, and sustainable utility services at just and reasonable rates.” And yet, it has not always shown an interest or ability to stand up to incumbent utilities or large corporations. It approved construction of Enbridge’s Line 3 crude oil pipeline in 2018 over the objections of state experts who were specifically involved to represent the public interest.
BlackRock’s financial and political power dwarfs Enbridge. Its $11.5 trillion in assets “exceed the GDP of every nation except the United States and China,” according to the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, known as CUB. If there ever was a company that was too big to regulate, BlackRock would be it.
BlackRock and CPP are willing to pay well above market value. Allete accepted their $67 per share offer, McKenzie’s report said. It was $1.5 billion more than Allete’s book value, or 22% above its share price prior to the sale’s announcement. Allete’s shareholders, not ratepayers, would get all the financial windfall. 
Allete and BlackRock have very different business models. Allete is a publicly-traded company “focused on energy and utility service,” said ALJ McKenzie. BlackRock is a global asset manager. It’s in the business of making money for its large, private investors.
Private equity firms “are not in the business of providing safe, reliable, and affordable electric service to northern Minnesotans” McKenzie wrote. “Private equity firms often target gross investment returns of 15 to 20% per year.”
The alleged benefits of the sale are not backed up 
Of particular concern, Allete and its potential buyers have made claims about the sale’s benefits that are at odds with the facts.
The public has no way to assess corporate claims. Important information was redacted from the public record because it was deemed confidential trade secret information. However, McKenzie, the administrative law judge, had access to the redacted information.
In spite of Allete and BlackRock’s claims that Minnesota Power customers would not suffer excessive rate hikes, McKenzie concluded that the buyers “are planning on significant rate increases.” The sale “creates an unacceptable risk of rate increase and rate shock in a critical and economically vulnerable area of Minnesota.”
Allete said access to new capital was a “primary benefit” from the sale, the administrative law judge wrote. However, the buyers “have not, in fact, promised to provide capital to Allete. Allete did not even ask for some commitment to provide equity. ”
Allete cited BlackRock’s “expertise” on utility infrastructure and renewable energy as a benefit. The administrative law judge disagreed, saying the buyers’ expertise “is unlikely to provide a material benefit to Minnesota Power or its ratepayers. Allete already has quality management and ‘near perfect’ reliability for its electric service.”
Allete has stated the sale will benefit Minnesota because the new partners “were intentionally and strategically chosen” to achieve Minnesota’s carbon-free goals. However, “the evidence shows the Partners were ultimately the only bidders for the company and were chosen based on their willingness to pay a stock premium” ALJ McKenzie wrote. 
BlackRock’s commitment to carbon-free goals is murky at best. “The nonpublic evidence reveals the buyers’ intent [is] to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”
BlackRock’s website says it pursues ethical investments, prioritizing companies with strong environmental, social and/or corporate governance, known as ESG objectives.
CUB, a party to the contested case, has challenged that image: “BlackRock just left a coalition aimed at aligning the asset management industry with global climate goals, causing the coalition to suspend its activities,” it wrote. “Further, BlackRock oversees an enormous amount of shares in fossil fuel companies and has a history of opposing climate-related shareholder motions at these companies.”
Finally, ALJ McKenzie said the buyers had shown a “lack of cooperation” during the proceedings, raising trust issues and the risk they won’t be transparent if they buy Minnesota Power.
Should the PUC approve the sale in spite of the overwhelming evidence against it, it would be one more painful example of how large industries have captured our state’s regulatory system, making the agency’s purpose of “protecting the public interest” more of a slogan, not reality.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2165923397.jpg,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958

Amsterdam, New York
Died July 28, 2025
Helena, Montana


After seven years of fighting to recover from severe spinal degeneration and paraplegia, Thomas Alan Yager died unexpectedly on July 28, 2025. Tom was born April 8, 1948 to Christopher Yager and Jeanne Salak Yager in Amsterdam, NY. He had four brothers: Douglas Lasher, Barrett Lasher, Micheal Yager, and Robert Kravis. Tom graduated in 1966 from WH Lynch High School in Amsterdam NY, and in 1970 from Syracuse University and SUNY College of Forestry. His father and uncle instilled a love of farming and deep satisfaction from growing and harvesting crops (when all went well). Tom was inspired throughout his life by his father, from whom he learned extensive mechanical and building skills, which he, in turn, passed on to his children (along with some rules about physics).
Tom lived his life as a father, a forester, a farmer, and a friend to all. He fathered 2 children with Karen Rounds Yager: Erik Yager and Kristen Yager. He married Janet Kennedy Mack in 1992, and was stepfather to Katherine Mack and Corey Mack. He was highly respected in the wood-products industry as he made improving the hardwood forests of Vermont and New York his life’s work. After graduation from college, he spent one year with International Paper Co. and then 50 years with The A. Johnson Co. of Bristol, VT as their Senior Forester.
Tom and Janet bred and raised Morgan horses, hay, and Christmas trees on their farm in Waltham, VT for 30 years before selling it and moving to the Helena area of Montana in 2021. Tom served on the Mt. Abraham School Board in Bristol for 15 years before moving to Waltham, where he served as Lister and delegate to the Addison County Regional Planning Commission for 18 years. Tom loved to play and watch basketball (Go SU!), hunt, fish, ride horses, work with his tractor, build stone walls, and to compete with their home-bred Morgans on the regional and national level with his wife and children.
Tom’s hard work and determination showed in everything he did, including his recovery from paraplegia. The day he died, he reached his goal of successfully walking 20 feet in the PT hallway at St. Peters Hospital without any walking aids. We know he was extremely grateful for the years of help and support he received from Dale Koch, Mary Beth Stevens, and his entire recovery team to reach his recovery goal, and was so grateful and appreciative of his friends and neighbors in Vermont and Montana. Tom is deeply loved and missed by his wife Janet of Clancy, MT; brother Bobby; children Erik (Jacki), Katherine, and Corey (Faye); six grandchildren Rachel (Jake), Samantha (Christian), Emma (Taylor), Ali, Emmett and Audrey; and great-grandson Roman.

(Courtesy of the Utah Office of Homeless Services)As the vision for a new, 1,300-bed homeless “campus” recently sited in northwest Salt Lake City begins to crystalize, a discussion in front of a panel of lawmakers this week showed that the state’s top homeless services leaders see it as a key component to the state’s response to President Donald Trump’s July controversial executive order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” 
To do so, they’re proposing the campus not only include additional homeless shelter, but also hundreds more beds to expand the state’s capacity for involuntary civil commitment and drug addiction treatment. 
Under a yet-to-be-approved proposal drafted by Randy Shumway, chair of the Utah Homeless Services Board, the campus would include a “certified community behavioral health clinic” with 300 to 400 beds reserved for people who are civilly committed — or court ordered into mental health treatment. 
Shumway’s proposal also envisions the campus including a “secure residential placement facility that provides substance use disorder treatment as an alternative to jail,” where people would “receive care in a supervised environment where entry and exit are not voluntary.” He called it an “accountability center” during a presentation in front of the Health and Human Services Interim Committee on Tuesday. 
Utah officials unveil site for 1,300-bed homeless campus after long, secretive search

“An individual would be sanctioned to go there. It would not be voluntary. They would be there for a period of probably 90 days with the opportunity to detox in order to get mental and behavioral health care, to get substance use disorder support, to get physical health care, and to be surrounded by a community that’s helping them in healing,” Shumway told the committee while presenting his proposal. 
Shumway’s proposal is his recommended action plan to align the state with Trump’s executive order — something he said he “wrote at the request” of the state’s top Republican leaders. He emphasized that it hasn’t been presented to or approved by the Utah Homeless Services Board, which is a powerful body that oversees the state’s homeless system and distributes funding to homeless providers. 
On July 29, five days after Trump’s executive order on homelessness, Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, Senate President Stuart Adams and Gov. Spencer Cox wrote a letter urging the Utah Homeless Services Board to act, including by accelerating “progress on a transformative, services-based homeless campus that prioritizes recovery, treatment, and long-term outcomes, not just emergency shelter.” 
Advocacy groups like the National Alliance to End Homelessness have condemned Trump’s executive order. They warn it imposes “a multitude of harmful, ineffective, and outdated policies and practices for addressing homelessness” while retreating from long-maintained federal “Housing First” strategies that prioritize federal funding to programs that provide immediate housing. 
They also worry it will also increase focus on “punishing” people experiencing homelessness by encouraging states and cities to more widely arrest people on the streets and expand their use of civil commitment to force people into mental health or drug addiction treatment. 
Trump executive order raises fear among advocates for people experiencing homlessness

Republican leaders of Utah, however, have warmly welcomed Trump’s executive order as aligned with their goal to make the state’s homeless system more “accountable” while emphasizing efforts to increase “public safety” on city streets. 
Cox, Schultz and Adams wrote that Trump’s executive order “aligns with the values and expectations that Utah has long championed, namely, that chronic homelessness is tied to mental illness, substance abuse, and the loss of human dignity.” They also wrote they “do not support ‘Housing First’ policies that lack accountability.”
“President Trump’s executive order reinforces what many of us in Utah have long understood: that effective solutions to homelessness require both accountability and support,” Cox, Schultz and Adams wrote, adding that the order “presents an opportunity to accelerate our efforts toward a more results-driven system that matches Utah’s guiding principles to end homelessness” that “emphasize comprehensive, wrap-around services anchored in real accountability and community-based support.”
They also directed the board to “ensure any funding requests are accompanied by a clear strategy that aligns with the President’s executive order, with a focus on reprioritizing existing resources.” 
Mental health, other services already underfunded
During Tuesday’s committee discussion, both a Democratic and Republican lawmaker pointed out that the state’s existing system, including mental health treatment, has long been underfunded. 
“I wonder if it’s not necessarily inefficiencies but underinvestment in the infrastructure that we do have,” said Rep. Jen Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City. 
Dailey-Provost added that she’s “concerned” about building a homeless campus in a remote area of Salt Lake City that’s “far away from the services and infrastructure that we do have — that we’ve designated as not being successful, but not because the infrastructure isn’t correct but because we’ve underinvested in it.”
“If we’re going to be efficient, I want to make sure we’re having a really hard conversation about investing in infrastructure that we have built, that we know works if it’s properly invested in,” she said. 
Rep. Steve Eliason, R-Sandy — a lawmaker who has a long track record of passing legislation related to homelessness, mental health and civil commitment — also hearkened back to his comments in front of the Utah Homeless Services Board more than a year ago, when he warned the state has been facing a major shortage of mental health beds. 
That shortage remains acute today, and even if the state homeless campus is built to accommodate 300 or 400 more civil commitment beds, there would still be hundreds more lacking, barring a major expansion elsewhere in the system. 
Utah’s new homeless board is warned of major mental health bed shortage

“As of a few days ago we had 1,461 individuals in the state on civil commitment,” Eliason said, noting that about 220 of those are in the Utah State Hospital, plus “maybe several dozen” in other mental health facilities. 
“That probably leaves at least 1,000 people currently under civil commitment on the streets,” he said. “So while I don’t disagree that applying civil commitment is a critical tool, currently our system is completely overwhelmed where people that are on civil commitment are not, in the vast majority of cases, receiving inpatient services. So that’s something we have to work on.” 
Shumway, in response to Eliason’s comments, pointed to a line in his proposal that says the 300 to 400 civil commitment beds would be federally funded with reimbursed Medicaid dollars. He said “we’re in close collaboration” with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on the proposal. 
“We’ve got to come to the rescue from a mental and behavioral health care standpoint,” Shumway said. 
Eliason said he “appreciated” Shumway’s comments, but “unfortunately if you look at the history of recent construction of psychiatric facilities in the state … inpatient beds are running about a million dollars a bed, just to be built to the standards that the federal government has required.” 
“So it’s a huge price tag,” Eliason said. 
Shumway’s proposal, however, said that under Trump’s executive order, “every federal housing, health and justice agency is instructed to link grants, waivers, and personnel to states that are investing in effective practices,” including opening “more in-patient psychiatric beds” and launching “jail-based competency-restoration units.”
But Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City — who was critical of the homeless campus being sited in west-side Salt Lake City — noted “there’s already a bunch of lawsuits” challenging Trump’s executive order. 
She urged Shumway to “engage with everyone” in the Legislature while formulating next steps. 
“Because it will require not only the funding of the Legislature, but also policies,” she said. “I mean, we’re going to have to change laws, and a lot of these are policy calls.” 
A low-income advocate’s concerns
Bill Tibbitts, deputy executive director of Crossroads Urban Center, a low-income advocacy nonprofit based in Utah, raised a slew of concerns about Shumway’s proposal in an email to Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday.
While state officials have said they expect the campus’ infrastructure to cost about $75 million — plus north of $30 million a year for ongoing operations — Tibbitts said what’s being proposed will likely need much more. 
“The cost of building a second state mental hospital, a large substance use treatment facility, and a shelter with 600 -1,300 beds will be much higher than $75 million,” Tibbitts said in his email, adding that it sounds like it could be even more expensive than Salt Lake County leaders’ failed proposal to use a $507 million bond to fix the county’s jail crisis. 
Tibbitts also worried about a possible chilling effect by building a civil commitment facility in proximity to homeless shelter beds.
$507 million bond meant to fix Salt Lake County’s jail crisis is on track to fail. Now what?

“A 300-400 bed mental and behavioral health facility that people are not allowed to leave is not a shelter but an incarceration option,” Tibbitts wrote. “Having such a facility colocated with a shelter would probably lead to a sense that if you do not follow the rules in one facility you could be moved into the other.” 
Tibbitts said Shumway’s presentation made it sound like services at the homeless campus would entail “a law enforcement presence at the shelter and an involuntary detention center for people unable to follow the rules.” 
“Would wandering away from the shelter without permission be something that gets you placed in the detention center? If so, how long before it is completely full?” Tibbitts questioned. 
Tibbitts also said it’s “worrisome” that the campus is envisioned to be a “regional entry point for homeless services.” 
“A senior citizen who had their rent increased beyond what they could afford is not going to want to go to a quasi correctional facility to get help finding a place to live that they can afford,” Tibbitts said. “The majority of the people who visit a shelter are not chronically homeless — they just need a place to stay following a short term period of financial hardship.”
During Tuesday’s presentation, both Shumway and state homeless coordinator Wayne Niederhauser emphasized that they envision Utah’s system helping move people along a “pathway” of rehabilitation and recovery and more efficiently placing people where they need to be in order to succeed. 
In response to a request for an interview about his comments during Tuesday’s meeting, Shumway declined, telling Utah News Dispatch in a text message that what he shared was “simply my vision and hasn’t yet been presented to the full (Utah Homeless Services Board).”
“We’re still very much in the early planning stages, so it’s a bit premature for a detailed conversation,” Shumway said. “Once we’re further along, I’d be happy to share more.” 
Asked whether what’s being proposed could be characterized as a “homeless jail” or something similar, Shumway said the envisioned “accountability center” is focused on “recovery, healing and reintegration.” 
“Participants receive a full suite of wraparound services, including mental and behavioral health care, physical healthcare, substance use disorder treatment, counseling, and education,” Shumway said. “The goal is simple: to break the cycle of crisis.  By addressing root causes, reducing recidivism, and saving lives, an Accountability Center offers a better path forward — an investment in people’s recovery and in stronger, safer communities.”

Harris expressed concerns over federal funding cuts to public health in a report released Thursday by Trust for America's Health. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s top health official said in a report released Thursday by the Trust for America’s Health (TFAH) that unpredictable federal funding and changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding vaccines will have ramifications for public health.
The report, released Thursday, encourages Congress to reinforce funding for public health in the fiscal year 2026 budget, which has not passed. The fiscal year begins in two weeks. 
Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama’s public health officer, said public health work is usually done “behind the scenes.”

“We are doing things to keep people healthy that the public doesn’t know or think about. People go out to eat and don’t worry about getting sick or drink tap water and aren’t concerned about it being unsafe,” Harris said in an August interview with TFAH. “The reason for all of these things is public health. When we lose the ability to do these things because our funding goes away, there will be negative consequences.”
Dr. Nadine Gracia, CEO and president of TFAH, said in a virtual press conference Wednesday proposed federal cuts to the CDC will directly impact communities. In President Donald Trump’s proposed FY26 budget, the CDC’s funding is cut 39%. About half of the cuts are in public health emergency preparedness, she said. 
“These cuts would make communities across the country less prepared for outbreaks as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires and heat waves, at a time when the frequency and intensity of such events are increasing,” Gracia said.
Funding for public health is not only essential, she said, but provides a large return on investment because it will bring “reduced health care spending, better health outcomes and increased economic productivity.”
Gracia said the purpose of the report is to document what has happened in public health under the new administration and to encourage educated decisions. 
Harris is also current president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). Dr. Joseph Kanter, the CEO of ASTHO, said in the virtual press conference that he was alarmed by the report’s findings and the threat to public health funding.
“The reductions and instability in public health funding highlighted in this report are deeply troubling, and I think warrant further examination of the potential effects on the health of communities across the country,” Kanter said. 
He said that although public health works, like disease prevention, are often not seen, if the prevention funding goes away hospitals will become more dangerous.
“A couple examples of this are controlling the spread of tuberculosis outbreaks in a community, food borne outbreaks that could threaten a restaurant chain or grocery store or food that ends up in people’s kitchens. Doing the hard work on the back end to identify and contain contaminated food before it grows and puts more families at risk,” Kanter said. “Hospital safety, working with health departments and hospitals to make sure that hospitals remain safe and free of very dangerous pathogens and a safe place for people to receive care.”
Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, also in the virtual press conference, echoed Kanter on prevention funding.
“These investments are seriously being threatened right at this moment, not just investments, the actual expertise at the federal level that helps guide us in these areas, is lost,” Freeman said. 
Harris, in his interview with TFAH, said more communication from the Trump administration would be helpful. The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) was reprimanded in August by the administration for violating Trump’s executive order on DEI, but ADPH said they were not told the specific nature of the violations. 
“We fully expect that when there’s a transition at the national level there will be changing priorities. That’s how our system works. The new administration gets to set the agenda,” Harris said in the TFAH interview. “We respect that and want to work with that. But what we need is something orderly, and what we would love is for someone to consult with us.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0336-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Representatives from nearly every taxi and limousine company in Southern Nevada say a plan by a subsidiary of Elon Musk’s Boring Company to operate Teslas as taxis in the Las Vegas tourism corridor will destroy their industry. 
Musk’s effort is designed to let his Vegas Loop tunnel project, which could take decades to complete, take immediate advantage of traffic at Harry Reid International Airport. 
Airport officials say they were unaware of the plan and confirmed the Boring subsidiary, Paradise Transportation, has not entered into an agreement with Reid International to have an on-site staging area, a requirement for all transportation services. 
A draft order filed by the Nevada Transportation Authority last month indicates the agency is poised to approve Musk’s effort to transport passengers throughout the tourism corridor and to and from the airport. 
The NTA did not respond when asked whether it ascertained that Paradise has obtained the entitlements required for the service it intends to provide. The matter is expected to be decided at the Oct. 10 meeting. 
Musk seeks to bring Vegas Loop’s tunneled Teslas to surface as taxis 

Dan Reaser, the chairman of the NTA’s sister agency, the Nevada Taxicab Authority, says he has doubts about whether the NTA has jurisdiction over the project. 
“I suggest the NTA carefully consider whether it’s granting an application that’s in our jurisdiction, as opposed to in their jurisdiction, and that that be articulated clearly on any public record that is made before that agency, so that if they’re creating precedent, we understand what that precedent is in administering our statutes,” Reaser said.  
Matters of jurisdiction are typically addressed “by the governor’s office of some other administrator,” Reaser added. 
Gov. Joe Lombardo did not respond to the Current’s inquiries. Dr. Kristopher Sanchez, director of the Department of Business and Industry, which oversees both the Taxicab Authority and Transportation Authority, also did not respond. 
“What they are attempting to do is to operate what amounts to meterless taxis above ground,” Cheryl Gibbons of zTrip, an app-driven taxi service, said last month at the Nevada Taxicab Authority meeting. “Their rates are in direct competition to taxi cab rates.”
Desiree Dante of Lucky, Western, and Ellis Cabs noted that with “104 more vehicles in that congested little area, it’s going to be impossible” to navigate the airport corridor. 
Cab and limousine companies want Paradise to be regulated by the Taxi Authority rather than the Nevada Transportation Authority, which regulates transportation network companies, such as Uber, and special services providers, the designation Paradise seeks. 
Industry insiders, who declined to speak on the record for fear of retaliation, say Musk is willing to lose money by undercutting competitors and potentially putting them out of business in order to prove his underground transit concept works.
The above-ground service, according to its application, sought to charge fares other modes of transportation can’t match: $5 for trips up to three miles, $10 for four to six miles, and $12 for trips of more than six miles. The approved draft order says Paradise has increased each fare by $2 since filing its application. 
The Livery Operator’s Association (LOA), which represents limousine and other chauffeured transportation in Southern Nevada, is protesting Paradise’s application. The LOA asserts Paradise is seeking to serve the same area as the limo drivers and that the designations sought by Paradise for special services and airport transit don’t reflect the operation it’s proposing.  
The protest also states the Boring Company failed to include in the Paradise application any documentation of the company’s safety record in the tunnels it is digging beneath the tourism corridor.  
Earlier this month, a Boring company worker suffered a “crushing” injury in a tunnel beneath Paradise Road, according to news reports, and was taken to the hospital. 
Attorney Kim Maxson Rushton, who represents the LOA, did not respond to requests for comment on why Boring’s underground safety record is relevant to Paradise Transportation’s application for above-ground transit. 
Transportation industry representatives fear Musk’s company, which applied to charge a per capita rate, will charge just one fare to multiple riders in the same vehicle with the same destination.  
“We already have people that drive 12 hours and barely pay their bills,” Mario Locascio of Deluxe Taxi told the Taxicab Authority. “I don’t know what the goal is. They are trying to just destroy the industry of cab and limos and bussing.” 
Boring is also soliciting job applicants in Southern Nevada to test his driverless cars for public transit.

,California,2025-09-18 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,How Gavin Newsom channeled Jerry Brown 1.0 with his flip-flop on oil and gas,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/gavin-newsom-flip-flop-oil/,"A year ago, Newsom was denouncing gasoline refiners for gouging consumers and pocketing huge profits. During the just-concluded legislative session, however, he and legislators acted to increase oil production in California. What happened?","Over the last half-century, California has had seven governors — counting Jerry Brown twice — who varied widely in temperament, ideology and efficacy.
One variable trait has been consistency, whether their positions on issues have changed and, if so, whether they own up or duck accountability.
Brown, who held the position from 1975 to 1983, was particularly prone to policy pirouettes, most spectacularly regarding Proposition 13, California’s iconic taxation limit.
Prior to its overwhelming approval in 1978, Brown repeatedly labeled the measure a “rip-off.” After its passage, however, Brown immediately declared himself a “born-again tax cutter” as he ran for reelection that year. He also sponsored a state income tax cut and a subsequent spending limit ballot measure. He even ran for president in 1980 (unsuccessfully) as an advocate of reduced spending and a balanced federal budget.
There were other notable flip-flops during Gov. Brown 1.0, including one on taxation of international corporations that he blamed on receiving “flaky data” from the state’s top tax official.
When asked about his frequent changes of position, Brown would cite Ralph Waldo Emerson’s aphorism that “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines,” implying that those with high intellects should be exempt from accountability.
Brown’s two Republican successors, George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson, made few promises other than managerial competency and largely delivered. They were followed by risk-averse Democrat Gray Davis, who nevertheless was recalled in 2003, and replaced by Republican action movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Schwarzenegger promised to shake up state government with tight limits on spending but quickly learned that he could not outmaneuver a Legislature dominated by professional Democratic politicians — nor persuade voters to pass his ballot measures. However he didn’t try to evade responsibility for his failures.
When Brown returned to the governorship in 2011 nearly three decades later, he was a much different person. Not only was he older but he was less prone to flights of political fancy. He promised merely to address bread and butter issues such as the state’s budget deficit and its deteriorating highways.
That brings us to Gavin Newsom, who is — in a sense — Brown’s nephew from the decadeslong intertwining of the Newsom and Brown families.
Newsom’s governorship has resembled Brown’s first stint: promises of bold action on issues such as single-payer health care, housing shortages, homelessness and climate change, followed by backtracking with excuses.
He has termed campaign promises such as creating single-payer health care and building 3.5 million new homes as “aspirational,” rather than doable, and blamed local officials for not attacking homelessness effectively. As Newsom enters the last phase of his governorship and appears to be preparing for a presidential campaign, ala Brown 1.0, he is navigating his biggest flip-flop.
A year ago, Newsom was denouncing gasoline refiners for gouging consumers and pocketing huge profits. He demanded that the Legislature help him crack down.
During the just-concluded legislative session, however, he and legislators acted to increase oil production in California. Meanwhile, the oversight agency Newsom sought to curb refiner profits is at least temporarily inactive.
What happened? The 2024 presidential election revealed popular angst about the cost of living. Meanwhile, two refineries announced plans to shut down, possibly leading to gasoline shortages and much higher prices, which would backfire on a Newsom presidential campaign.
Bloomberg reported this month that Newsom and legislators are even considering giving one of the refineries millions of dollars to remain open.
“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one’s naive about that,” Newsom said at a recent press conference. “So it’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.”

The board unanimously approved benefit changes and a withdrawal from the Retirees Trust Fund on Wednesday.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The State Employees’ Insurance Board (SEIB) Wednesday approved withdrawals from a trust fund and increases to certain deductibles and co-pays for state employees to address a deficit caused by increasing health care costs.
Under recommendations by CEO Stephanie Azar that the executive board approved earlier this month, the board withdrew $30.4 million from the Retiree Trust Fund for the remainder of fiscal year 2025, which ends in two weeks. Azar said the goal was to avoid a greater financial burden in FY26. 
“We just saw the $26.9 million deficit and potential deficit for fiscal year 2026,” she said.

Withdrawals are limited to 10% of the trust’s fair market value on the last day of the previous fiscal year, Azar said, which was $304.7 million. The last time money was taken from the trust, she said, was in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, also to address funding shortfalls. 
The board also approved benefit changes that Azar said will save SEIB about $3.7 million per year. The changes do not impact members’ premiums:

Major medical calendar year deductible (from $300 to $350)
Inpatient hospital stays (from $250 to $300 deductible, and from $25 to $50 copay)
Emergency room visits (from $0 copay to $250 copay excluding accidents and $300 copay including accidents)
Specialist and ER physician visits (from $35 copay to $40)

“On a premium, every member would have to pay any increase in a premium, but on a benefit plan change, it’s only going to impact that member if they go to a specialist,” Azar said after the meeting.
Lastly, the board approved a motion for Azar to request a $1,175 per member per month rate from the Legislature for FY27. That is a $150 increase over the FY26 state share. Whether or not the rate is increased will depend on the Legislature, as the share comes from the General Fund budget. 
If the Legislature approves the $1,175 rate for SEIB’s nearly 32,000 active members, it will cost about $447 million, which is about a $57 million increase over FY26.
Alabama Director of Finance Bill Poole said that there was no guarantee the Legislature would approve an increase. 
“We can suggest raising the rate as high as we want, but the Legislature is not going to be able to generate that type of revenue in FY27 out of the General Fund budget,” Poole said. “So we have reached, or are reaching, the point of some very difficult decisions.”
Azar, however, said she has been in touch with legislative leadership about the increase.
“We’re going to work really, really hard at SEIB to procure proper funding on that state rate increase,” Azar said. 
The Alabama Legislature will begin consideration of the FY 2027 budgets when it begins its 2026 regular session in January.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0429-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958

The 2024 Annual Housing Progress Report, which was released last month by the state Housing Division and tracks affordable housing inventory across jurisdictions in Washoe and Clark counties, found overall in both counties there was a 3% increase in affordable housing units created from 2023.
Of the 1,062 affordable units the report identified as created or renovated to add to the inventory, all but 36 were located in Washoe County. The City of Reno created 1,011 units while the City of Sparks added 15 units. 
Both the cities of Las Vegas and Mesquite lost existing affordable units after they reverted back to private market rates. According to the report, there were 39 units converted from affordable to market rate housing in Las Vegas and 31 in Mesquite. 
The City of Mesquite was the only jurisdiction in Clark County to add to the affordable housing inventory and created 36 entirely new units in 2024, the report found, which left the city with a net increase of five units.
In an email to Nevada Current, the Nevada Housing Division wrote the lack of affordable housing added in Southern Nevada last year wasn’t entirely unexpected in the aftermath of the pandemic adding that “the supply chains, and other construction factors in the two-three year window in which new construction projects are developed.”
“It is important to note that this should be the last year of these impacts as the Division foresees the use of Clark County Community Housing funds, the Home Means Nevada Initiative funds, the Nevada Attainable Housing fund, in addition to our traditional LIHTC funding, to create and preserve over 5800 affordable units anticipated to be placed in service in the next few years in Clark County, including this year.”
Another 8,218 affordable units statewide are scheduled to be developed over the next few years, according to the report. Of the units in the pipeline, 3,351 dedicated toward very low income households, or those with incomes below 50% of the area median income. 
The housing division said projects typically take two to three years but that it’s “it’s difficult to quantify a specific date for occupancy.”
The Ogden Pines complex in Las Vegas was demolished, which led to the city losing 39 units, but a new affordable housing project built in its place will have 51 units, said Jace Radke, a spokesman for the City of Las Vegas.
“While those units were ‘lost,’ it is temporary between demolition in 2024” and when the new complex is completed in either 2026 or 2027 and will have 12 more units than the old complex, Radke said.
Nevada, like the nation, is contending with a shortage of affordable and available housing. 
The state’s yearly report compiles information provided by jurisdictions in Clark and Washoe in order to “analyze trends to the degree possible and highlights notable efforts to establish and maintain affordable housing.”
Housing inventory included in the report consists of units funded with federal, state, or local subsidies that restrict how much rent can be charged to tenants to ensure they aren’t paying more than 30% of their income. 
“To be included within the inventory, properties must either have project-based rental assistance, or agreements restricting the income levels of occupants or their rent levels,” the report reads. 
There are approximately 32,944 total units that met that definition as of last year. The previous year had 31,952 the year before. 
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 allocated billions of dollars of federal relief to Nevada. The state allocated roughly $500 million in funding to go toward developing and preserving affordable housing. 
The report notes that while Southern Nevada jurisdictions “reported a year-over year decrease due to lost units and little or no” additional properties, the nearly 33,000 affordable units developed statewide in 2024 was “an all-time high.”
 A 3.1% increase in total units between 2023 and 2024 outpaced the 2.0% increase from 2022 to 2023, the report notes. The previous year’s housing analysis found that the state created 690 new affordable units in 2023, during which Clark County was responsible for 470 units.
In addition to dearth of new developments, Southern Nevada’s loss in affordable housing stock in 2024 was due to the 71 units in Las Vegas and Mesquite converting to market rate. That includes the 39 units that were in the old Ogden Pines complex.
Nonprofit contractors and privately owned developers can secure tax credits in exchange for allocating a portion of their units at affordable rates, but those units are typically only locked into those rates for 15 or 30 years. 
Fair market rent in Nevada is roughly $1,400 a month, meaning a minimum wage employee earning $12 an hour would have to work 91 hours to afford the rent that doesn’t exceed more than 30% of their income, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Nevada state lawmakers in 2021 passed legislation to provide localities and tenants a 12-month notification before units are no longer deemed affordable in an attempt to preserve existing stock of affordable housing units. The intent was to give municipalities a chance to work with developers to keep properties from transitioning to market rate or, if need be, relocate low-income tenants. 
“Losing the existing inventory is weighing us down,” former state Sen. Julia Ratti said at the time. “We can build all the new units in the world, but if we can’t keep the ones we’ve already got we’re not making any progress.”
In an email, the city of Mesquite said that the 31 single-family units “were originally built for the low-income population.” 
“The homes are currently owned by individuals, who purchased at affordable rates, and they are currently no longer subject to affordability restrictions,” according to the city.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Housing_RondaChurchill_012-aerial-vista-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958

Jay Nixon answers a student’s question after giving the 60th John Findley Green Foundation Lecture as part of the 20th Annual Hancock Symposium on Monday at Westminster College in Fulton (Elia Mast/Missourian).Democracy is under strain, and the right question to ask is whether anyone cares enough to make a difference, former Gov. Jay Nixon told a crowd Wednesday afternoon at Westminster College in Fulton.
“Do we care enough about the principles of our democracy to preserve it? And what can each of us do to rekindle that necessary spark?” Nixon asked during the John Findley Green Foundation Lecture in Champ Auditorium.
Since 1937, the John Findley Green lecture has been delivered by Winston Churchill, Harry Truman, William Fulbright, Hubert Humphrey, George H.W. Bush and Ralph Nader, among other esteemed speakers.
On Wednesday, Nixon spoke with urgency about the state of democracy, calling on all Americans to “resist apathy with action.” He also listed decisive actions people can take to effect change.
Join a faith community, he said. Volunteer. Become part of a civic organization. Seek out someone who disagrees with you and just listen.
“Find a life affirming activity that reminds you that all people are deserving of respect and compassion, and finally, vote,” he said.
Nixon was the most recent Democrat to serve as governor of Missouri before leaving office in 2017. Before that, he served as Missouri’s attorney general and as state senator representing Jefferson County. He is now a partner with the Dowd Bennett law firm in St. Louis.
During the speech, Nixon repeatedly abstained from engaging in partisan criticism, opting instead to emphasize issues that bring people together. But he did not shy away from pointing to the threats
“In Washington and across the country, we see … abuses of power and self-dealing demands for unquestioned loyalty, suppression of dissent, the use of fear and force to compel obedience rampant lies and disinformation,” he said.
He reminded the audience that the source of power in our democracy lies not in politicians or violent actors, but with the public.
“We need leaders who understand that the purpose of our government is to help make people’s lives better,” Nixon said, “but more important than the action of our leaders are the actions each of us must take at the ballot box on election day and each day in between — in church pews, around kitchen tables, and in college classrooms.”
When the former governor spoke about topics fueled by mean-spirited rhetoric, he chose to do so in a balanced manner.
“This administration’s threats to target people for being critical of Charlie Kirk’s ideology is an insult to his memory and an affront to our values,” he said. “That also means no more cancel culture.
“We need to stop treating political correctness as a substitute for political progress. We need leaders of radical honesty and integrity.”
Nixon brought attention to a coincidence he has seen between the erosion of public trust in American institutions with decades of hyperpartisan politics intended to divide us against ourselves, rather than unite us for the common good.
“Misinformation, disinformation and bald-faced lies now spread faster than the measles,” he said. “Untethered from actual reality, we are now free to create and foster our own. The more time spent there, any solidarity we once felt for our neighbors has been effectively atomized.”
He called courage the most important asset to achieve. It is telling the truth, admitting mistakes and rejecting violence and hatred in it all its forms.
“Courage is not silence in your critics. That’s cowardice,” he said. “Courage is not bullying the vulnerable, that’s cruelty … Courage is telling the truth even when it’s hard standing up to bullies, behaving ethically, even when it demands personal sacrifice.”
Like the Americans who came before us, Nixon said, we control the means to become more divided or to mend the rift if we so choose.
“We are the great, great-great grandchildren of slaves and those who enslaved them,” he said.
“The first families who inhabited these lands, and those who drove them from it,” he added. “A nation of scrappy strivers stitched together by our ideals, marked by our original sins, but redeemed by the courage and sacrifice that saved us from fascism and unleashed freedom and prosperity — the envy of the world.
“This is the true story. We need to tell the promise we made to each other — that we are still working to keep.”

,DC,2025-09-18 11:10:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US rolls toward a 'terrible' government shutdown, no exit ramp in sight",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-rolls-toward-terrible-government-shutdown-no-exit-ramp-sight,,"WASHINGTON — Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have entered a stalemate over whether to fund the government for seven weeks or begin a shutdown that could last considerably longer, amid high partisan tensions.Lawmakers, it seems, did not learn from two earlier shutdowns that produced zero results for Republicans who tried to force their policy preferences on Democrats.The 2013 shutdown that lasted 16 days began with GOP demands to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and ended with it remaining the law of the land. The 2018-2019 shutdown started when President Donald Trump insisted on additional funding for a border wall, but concluded 35 days later with the same amount of money included in the original appropriations bill. This time around, however, it’s Democrats making demands ahead of a funding deadline and striking a markedly different tone from just a few months ago.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this year that shutting down the government would cede considerable power to the Trump administration and represented a far worse option than advancing a Republican-drafted stopgap spending bill.“President Trump and Republican leaders would like nothing more than to pull us into the mud of a protracted government shutdown,” Schumer said in March. “For Donald Trump, a shutdown would be a gift. It would be the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda.”But that has all changed in the six months since.

Schumer, who fielded considerable blowback from the Democratic base in March, now says his party will not help GOP leaders advance a seven-week temporary funding patch ahead of the Oct. 1 shutdown deadline, since — encouraged by Trump — they didn’t negotiate the bill. “Democrats don’t want a shutdown, but Republicans cannot shut Democrats out of the process and pretend like the last nine months have been business as usual,"" Schumer said. ”Republicans know that these abuses can’t just continue as if everything is just fine.”If Schumer sticks to that stance and is joined by enough other Democrats and independents, the Senate will not have sufficient votes for the funding patch. Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of Congress but cannot advance legislation in the Senate without the support of at least 60 lawmakers, which typically forces bipartisanship on major issues. Schumer on a ‘fool’s errand’?Republicans and Democrats interviewed by States Newsroom said the most recent shutdowns show that forcing a funding lapse doesn’t lead to policy wins or political victories. But they appeared to acknowledge the increasing likelihood of one beginning next month.  West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito referred to the prior government shutdowns as a “misery march” and deferred to Democrats on how exactly lawmakers would get out of a funding lapse if one begins. “When a shutdown gets predicated on a policy position that's never going to work — which I think is what Schumer's brought to (Majority Leader John Thune) — I think that it's a fool's errand, quite frankly,” Capito said. “And it's unfair to the American people.”

Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy said Schumer should consider what Trump will do in the event of a shutdown, when the president has considerable authority to determine which federal workers and operations are exempt and which are not. “He will have pretty much unfettered discretion, at least in his mind, to do whatever he wants to do,” Kennedy said. “And I personally think the president will make it very painful.”Exempt federal employees continue to work during a shutdown and often handle the preservation of life or property, or national security issues. Non-exempt workers are essentially furloughed. Both categories receive back pay once a shutdown ends. Trump bars negotiations with DemsHawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said that Trump telling Republicans not to negotiate a short-term stopgap bill with Democrats led to the impasse.“Shutdowns are terrible and they should be avoided. And Donald Trump may or may not know that the only way to avoid a shutdown is to work with both parties,” Schatz said. “And yesterday morning … he said, ‘I don't need to deal with the Democrats.’ And so, Godspeed.”

Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said nothing can be accomplished unless Republican leaders begin serious talks over government funding. “Right now, we don't even have a negotiation,” Murphy said. “The basic responsibility of a majority party when you're working on a budget is to negotiate with a minority. You need our votes. So who knows what's possible because right now, they're refusing to talk to Democrats.”Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt said Schumer’s change in stance on shutdowns is largely political and stems from the criticism he experienced from his own party earlier this year after helping advance the March stopgap. Nearly every House Democrat voted against that six-month stopgap bill and many voiced frustrations after Schumer aided Republicans in advancing the bill through the Senate. “This is all about political theater because, unfortunately for all of us that are trying to actually get something done, he's afraid of his own shadow. And that shadow’s name is AOC,” Britt said, referring to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who is rumored as a potential Democratic primary opponent when Schumer faces reelection in 2028. Dems want health care subsidy extension  House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said there’s still time to avoid a shutdown if GOP leaders begin serious bipartisan negotiations on funding and health care. “​​We still have time. We can negotiate a continuing resolution,” DeLauro said. “But there are, as I said, Democratic priorities. And look, the American people are very concerned about what's happening with health care. It's already out there. So, you know, they're going to hear about it. They'll hear about the fight that we're going to make on this.”Democrats have said for weeks that they want Republicans to negotiate an extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the calendar year. The credits are used by people who purchase their own health insurance on the ACA market.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said earlier this week that he views that as “a December policy issue, not a September funding issue,” even though open enrollment in that health insurance marketplace begins on Nov. 1 and ends on Dec. 15. There are several health policy provisions in House Republicans’ stopgap spending bill, though none addressing that particular issue. Johnson hopes to pass the legislation this week amid a razor-thin majority and some opposition from within his own party. House approval, which is far from guaranteed, would send the bill to the Senate, where it likely will not get the votes to become law before the deadline.Complicating matters is a week-long recess for Rosh Hashanah. Both chambers are set to return on Sept. 29, with very little time to broker a bipartisan agreement and hold votes, though leaders could cancel part of that break. No pay for feds during shutdownThe two most recent shutdowns began after GOP lawmakers believed it was the best way to bring attention to significant policy disputes and force Democrats to back their proposals. But the status quo remained after both shutdowns. Despite those experiences, Democrats appear ready to gamble they’ll have better luck amid the unprecedented actions of the second Trump administration to challenge the congressional power of the purse and more, though that’s far from a guarantee.

Any shutdown, especially a prolonged one, would cause considerable financial strain for federal employees and Americans who rely on many government services. Since none of the dozen annual government funding bills have become law on time, all federal workers would go without pay during a shutdown, including those at the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Interior and Transportation.Staff for members of Congress, who weren’t affected by the last shutdown, would miss their salaries this time around if a shutdown begins with the new fiscal year on Oct. 1.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-18 07:57:34.850516

Thomas/Getty Images)Washington state will backfill lost Medicaid dollars for Planned Parenthood after a court ruling last week. 
At the same time, advocates continue to push for restored funding for abortion access that lawmakers cut in Washington’s new state budget.
In the so-called “big, beautiful bill” congressional Republicans approved in July, they included a prohibition on Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood clinics across the country. Unlike many of the law’s other provisions, the one-year moratorium took effect when President Donald Trump signed the law. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson committed in July to backfilling more than $11 million Planned Parenthood stands to lose in Washington without a year’s worth of federal Medicaid reimbursements. 
In response to a lawsuit from the nonprofit, a federal judge quickly blocked this part of the law after its passage. 
But last week, a Boston-based appeals court allowed the federal government to stop Medicaid spending for Planned Parenthood services. The ruling could jeopardize medical care for more than 1.1 million patients using Medicaid nationwide, including nearly 43,000 in Washington, according to the organization.
“The real victims in the Trump Administration’s political, cruel attack on reproductive rights are Washingtonians who will lose their health care provider. I will not allow that to happen,” Ferguson said in a statement. “Washington will step into this temporary gap to ensure women continue to have access to critical health care.”
Planned Parenthood clinics will submit claims to the state Health Care Authority for Medicaid reimbursement, as usual. But now that money will come only from state coffers, with no federal help. 
“The experience for Planned Parenthood and its patients will remain the same,” said Jennifer Martinez, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates. “The only thing that’s changing is where the money is coming from.”
Medicaid, which provides health coverage to low-income and disabled Americans, is jointly funded by the federal government and states. Federal dollars under the program already can’t pay for abortions except in cases where the pregnancy endangers the mother or is the product of rape or incest. 
The new moratorium targets Planned Parenthood’s other services, including primary care and cancer screenings. The organization says that abortions make up just a fraction of the services it provides.
In Washington, Planned Parenthood’s 30 health centers serve over 100,000 patients each year, according to the nonprofit. Planned Parenthood has previously closed clinics in Washington due to low Medicaid reimbursement rates. In Washington, Medicaid is known as Apple Health.
Elsewhere, Planned Parenthood has said a block of Medicaid funding puts many of its health centers at risk of closure. Democratic state lawmakers in Oregon are forming a work group to brainstorm ways to reimburse Planned Parenthood centers. 
Abortion Access Project
Reimbursements are coming as leaders of Planned Parenthood press Ferguson and state lawmakers to restore the $8.5 million cut to the Abortion Access Project in the current two-year budget. The project funneled money to Planned Parenthood and other groups.
Washington created the Abortion Access Project following the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling, which guaranteed the right to an abortion. The loss of dollars could mean reduced hours and staffing cuts at clinics and less security for patients, advocates say.
This week, they learned the state Department of Health, which would oversee the money, did not ask the governor to include it in the supplemental budget he will release in December.
While there is no formal request, a spokesman for the Office of Financial Management said it is anticipated the issue will be part of the conversation as the budget is developed.

Martinez, from Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, said she understood agency proposals needed to be “narrow and limited in scope.”
Planned Parenthood stood to receive $6.8 million of the state funding over two years. Martinez said service reductions are not imminent and the organization is “committed to keeping its doors open and serving patients.”
“We remain cautiously optimistic that this funding will be included in December’s budget,” she said, adding the organization “is in the midst of a perfect storm — increasing health care costs, workforce shortages, and attacks from a hostile Trump administration. The last thing Planned Parenthood providers and patients need is a funding cut from the state government.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/planned-parenthood-sign-2025-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-18 07:57:34.850516

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Lawmakers who voted to implement work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries next summer will have to wait another six months before they can take effect, and the state is still waiting to hear if the federal government will approve other portions of the health care plan.
Meanwhile, Indiana’s financial toll under a new federal law is beginning to take shape, though final numbers are currently under review, according to comments before the State Budget Committee on Wednesday.
More than 652,000 Hoosiers are enrolled on the Healthy Indiana Plan, or HIP, as of August. State lawmakers voted earlier this year to impose work requirements on the low- to moderate-income Hoosiers starting in July — though many are already working and others may qualify for exceptions such as child care commitments or substance use treatment.

But the federal government won’t let Indiana move forward with work requirements until 2027, when all Medicaid expansion enrollees must meet that condition as part of President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill.” He signed that into law this summer.
Other parts of Indiana’s HIP 3.0 proposal are still under consideration, including an expansion on provider taxes, cost-sharing requirements and wellness incentives.
“We are attempting to revise the benefit package to reinsert personal responsibility and give people carrots as well as sticks,” said Mitch Roob, the secretary of the Family and Social Services Administration. “The Big, Beautiful Bill gives them several sticks. Regarding cost-sharing requirements, we’d like to provide them with several carrots.”
For example, he said, getting a flu shot would decrease someone’s cost-sharing requirement under Indiana’s proposal — which may not be possible under federal rules. 
Roob previously led the administration under former Gov. Mitch Daniels, introducing the first version of HIP nearly two decades ago. 
Overall, Medicaid is Indiana’s fastest-growing expense, increasing from $2.1 billion in 2017 to nearly $5 billion in 2027. 
Part of those increases can be attributed to Applied Behavior Analysis therapy and PathWays attendant care costs, he said. The first is a popular option for parents with autistic children while the second pays individuals caring for those 60 and older.
Additionally, expenses for Federally Qualified Health Centers grew during that time. In the 2021 fiscal year, costs were under $300 million. This year, it’s roughly $500 million.
The sites provide low-cost and free health care services to underserved populations, though costs vary from clinic to clinic. One center, Roob noted, cost the state $600 per visit. 
“We’re working with the federal government to try to get this under control. We have very little control because the … rules put in place by the federal government,” Roob said. 
 Impact of the Big, Beautiful Bill

Following pushback from rural providers, which have a disproportionately high number of patients who rely on Medicaid, Congress created a $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. 
States must apply to get those funds by Nov. 5, 2025, with $10 million available annually for the next five years. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the program has five strategic goals: improving rural health, increasing access, workforce development, investing in innovative care models and fostering technology adoption. 
State agency plans aggressive new budget method to control growing Medicaid costs

For Indiana, Roob floated the possibility of improving Indiana’s emergency services in light of the rural ambulance shortage or bolstering prenatal and postpartum care for pregnant women. 
But the law threatens Indiana’s finances in other ways, specifically by capping provider taxes. By taxing hospitals at 6%, the state leverages an increased federal reimbursement to those providers and uses those dollars to fund its HIP obligation. The federal government pays for 90% of HIP expenses while the state uses provider taxes, along with taxes on cigarettes, to pay for the last 10%. 
The new federal law would limit that provider tax to 3.5%, limiting the money Indiana could collect. That 3.5% cap would also apply to provider taxes imposed on managed care entities — a levy Indiana doesn’t have, though other states do.
The limits, overall, “are unfortunate for us,” Roob said, though they won’t go into effect for a few years. Until then, Roob and other Indiana leaders hope the federal government will allow Indiana to impose a 6% tax on managed care entities until then.
“This will create significant stress for the Indiana Medicaid program, not necessarily in 2027, 2028 and 2029,” Roob said. “But in the years after that, it looks tough.”
Indiana will also have to pay more to administer food benefits — also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. For the next fiscal year, Indiana will pay $36 million more. After that, costs go up to $50 million moving forward, he said.
 Reining in health care costs

Indiana’s Medicaid costs don’t exist in a vacuum, rising and falling with overall health care costs. High hospital prices, in particular, drive costs up for government and private insurers alike — though Roob said health outcomes were “substandard.” 
Twenty years ago, he said, the assumption was that hospital prices were high because of the state’s large uninsured population. 
“Today, despite near universal insurance coverage, hospital costs have skyrocketed without corresponding improvements in outcomes,” Roob said.

Hospitals resisted a legislative effort earlier this year establishing so-called “price caps,” delaying any associated penalties until 2029. Under that law, the state will calculate an “average hospital rate” based on Medicare for certain inpatient and outpatient services.
Roob unveiled a new state effort to use Medicaid reimbursements as a tool to lower hospital costs. 
The formula for Medicaid rates will vary, taking into account whether the facility is a county, critical access or rural hospital. Those whose commercial rates are significantly higher than Medicare rates will receive less from Medicaid, and vice versa.
Medicare covers seniors and has its rates established by the federal government — while Medicaid covers low- and moderate-income Hoosiers and is operated by the state.
Though hospital prices — and general health care cost increases — push up Medicaid expenses, Roob has sought to control the state’s responsibility with aggressive budgeting tactics and monthly financial reviews.
“Unfortunately, we have built a health care delivery system that we can no longer afford. And it’s time that we face that reality and make the necessary changes in that delivery system because every dollar we send to a hospital is one dollar we don’t send to a school,” Roob said. 
Committee member Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, said he disagreed with that assessment.
“It is probably correct from your perspective as the secretary of FSSA. From my perspective as a legislator, we have few critical functions as a state to deliver to the public: education is one, health care is two, public safety is three (and) infrastructure is four,” Qaddoura said. 
He criticized state spending on “misplaced” priorities, including economic development initiatives and prison upgrades. 
“To me, it is not either or. It is not a choice between health care and Medicaid. It’s a sick child that needs health care and still needs to go to school,” Qaddoura said. 
Specifically, he said the state could improve if it invested more in preventative health care and insurance reform.
The budget committee will meet again at the end of October.

Gov. Mike Kehoe created the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force in an executive order in January and appointed members from a wide swath of backgrounds, including a leader from the Missouri Soybean Association and a senior director from the Herzog Foundation, one of six educational assistance organizations that help distribute private school scholarships under the state’s MOScholars program.
Now, with work groups meeting, the number of people guiding the discussion has more than doubled. Among those joining the effort are Linda Quinley, who serves as senior director of school finance for the Missouri School Boards Association, and Premier Charter School’s director of finance Andy Vien.
Between the two working groups that met Wednesday, seven of the new advisors have experience as superintendents or other administrative positions for public school districts.
The groups will meet six times through the end of the year and are expected to give a report to the larger task force in January or February.
Wednesday’s meetings of the local effort and performance incentives work groups largely served to orient members to their mission.
The local effort task force is charged with finding solutions to adapt a new funding formula to varying property values and tax rates statewide.
The current foundation formula calculates local funding with an assumed tax rate of $3.43 per $100 of assessed valuation. This is multiplied by the assessed property values within a school district from the 2004-05 school year.
Now, 20 years later, school districts with shrinking property values or with tax rates below 3.43% are shortchanged.
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s recently retired finance chief Kari Monsees, who led Wednesday’s meetings, said the group should find a way to unfreeze property values.
“Is there another way we can calculate this local revenue that remains more accurate over time?” he said. “It’s going to be a moving target, but we just need to be thinking about how we try to make our recommendations more immune to those policy shifts over time.”
Complicating the group’s efforts are conversations statewide about property-tax policies and a push from the Missouri State Tax Commission to increase residential assessments.
Monsees raised the idea of adding local income levels as a factor.
The second group meeting Tuesday is charged with creating additional sources of funding for high-performing schools, following Kehoe’s call for “incentives based on performance of schools and educational outcomes.” This would be a new addition to Missouri’s school funding formula.
“What is it that we want to incentivize? We have to be able to do it mechanically, but it also needs to be for the right reasons, for the benefit of students,” Monsees told the group.
He recommended that the incentives adapt to districts’ various socioeconomic conditions.
“Some are more advantaged or disadvantaged than others,” he said. The suggestion is we avoid something that would just automatically reward those with low poverty with more money.”
The state of Tennessee adopted a formula in the past few years that gives extra funding when students reach certain targets. Students identified as English-language learners, economically disadvantaged or disabled who reach targets earn more for their schools.
Tennessee’s performance-based funding is a small portion from the state’s formula, Monsees pointed out.
The group suggested a variety of factors that could earn districts a bonus. 
Monsees recommended third-grade literacy or college readiness as factors to incentivize. But he also questioned whether the state has enough data to be able to look into student success after graduation.
“I would describe our data systems here within our state as less than robust,” he said. “So that’s a challenging area, especially if we want to get something that tries to connect the K-12 setting with post-secondary outcomes.”
Mike Podgursky, a semi-retired economics professor from the University of Missouri-Columbia and affiliated scholar at the Sinquefield Center for Applied Economic Research, suggested using Missouri’s growth model.
“Missouri has a growth model which does adjust for prior achievement and does a very good job of leveling out the playing field,” he said.
The growth model is part of the state’s school accreditation program and has drawn questions in recent years, with school superintendents asking for more transparency in how growth is calculated.
Other suggestions included incentivizing schools who meet five days a week and looking at teacher effectiveness. A bill passed in 2024 gave a small financial incentive to have classes five days a week.
Working groups studying funding targets and student counts are scheduled to meet Tuesday.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-18 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘They’re sitting on money while people die’: Mississippi is years behind other states in using opioid settlements to address addiction,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/18/years-behind-opioid-funds/,"Three years into managing money intended to address this crisis, state and local leaders have committed less opioid settlement money to prevent overdoses than every other state in the country — both in total dollars and as a percentage of settlement shares.","Opioid overdoses have killed thousands of Mississippians in the last decade, and Attorney General Lynn Fitch and the state Legislature have said the crisis requires effective, bipartisan solutions. 
But three years into managing money intended to address this crisis, state and local leaders have committed less opioid settlement money to prevent overdoses than every other state in the country — both in total dollars and as a percentage of settlement shares. 
Elected officials have reported using less than $1 million of the over $124 million in opioid settlement funds they manage for direct measures to combat addiction, according to public records Mississippi Today requested. The other 49 states, including ones receiving significantly less money, have allocated at least $3 million each from the lawsuits to address the public health problem.  
About $109 million of Mississippi’s money has been sent to the state government, according to a public record requested from Fitch’s office. The state has used roughly $20 million of that to pay the Ridgeland law firm of John Davidson, the attorney general’s outside counsel for the opioid lawsuits. 
The state Legislature controls the remaining $89 million. But lawmakers only this year created the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council, which is tasked with making recommendations about how to spend the funds to address the overdose crisis. The recommendations the Legislature approves are expected to be allocated in July 2026, when the next state budget goes into effect.
The rest of the money is with Mississippi’s towns, cities and counties. The localities have received over $15.5 million of opioid settlement money, according to a Mississippi Today investigation. Officials have spent $945,000 on strategies the settlement’s plaintiff lawyers recommend for curbing the crisis. 
They spent about $5.4 million on a variety of purposes not related to fighting addiction, such as routine government expenses, police body cameras and new city vehicles.
Fitch — unlike attorneys general in at least 34 other states — did not require any of the money local governments receive to be spent on addiction-related purposes, and she also did not require localities to report their expenses. 

Elected officials and Davidson expressed more urgency when arguing for this money in court. When the state filed a lawsuit in 2018 against companies that flooded towns with addictive and deadly opioid prescription painkillers, then-Attorney General Jim Hood and Davidson wrote that these dollars were necessary to respond to the “public health epidemic that these Defendants have created.” That lawsuit and other similar ones are expected to pay Mississippi around $421 million through 2040.
The public health crisis has ramped up in the roughly seven years since the lawyers wrote that. More people are dying of overdoses in Mississippi and the U.S. than in 2018, and there have been over 1,300 Mississippi drug deaths since the national settlement managers wired Fitch’s office the first payment in September 2022, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The state Health Department has counted more than 4,600 non-fatal overdoses in the first six months of 2025 alone. And Mississippians still have trouble finding resources. Many in the state with opioid use disorder aren’t treated with the gold-standard medications and can’t find safe sober-living options, according to recent studies. 
“There’s been three years now that people have been dying for no reason,” said Melody Worsham, a Harrison County peer support specialist for the Mississippi Recovery Advocacy Project. “They’re sitting on money while people die.”

After being presented with these findings in a letter, Fitch did not answer a question about whether she and the Legislature have done enough with the settlement dollars to prevent Mississippians from overdosing. 
Her chief of staff, Michelle Williams, said in a statement the public health crisis has cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and the lawsuits themselves allow for some of the settlement money to pay for prior expenses made to address the epidemic.
She added that Fitch’s office was pleased the Legislature passed a law in the spring to start distributing most of the dollars with recommendations from the settlement advisory council. She said the office is looking forward to working with the committee’s members.
Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and Speaker of the House Jason White did not respond to emails asking if the Legislature had done enough to address addiction with these dollars over the past three years. Davidson didn’t respond to a similar email.

Delbert Hosemann, a Republican, right, speaks with reporters, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023, after a meeting of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee in Jackson, Miss., while former House Speaker Philip Gunn, R-Clinton, center and Speaker Jason White, R-West, left, listen.

One factor that could have delayed Mississippi’s opioid settlement spending is that state elected officials altered the distribution plan as they were receiving the dollars. In 2021, Fitch and local government leaders agreed to a plan that would send 70% of the settlement funds to the University of Mississippi Medical Center for a new addiction medicine center. 
But the Legislature overrode Fitch’s contract. Lawmakers passed a bill this spring to create the advisory council that makes recommendations about which private and public addiction response projects the dollars should go toward — recommendations lawmakers can approve or reject. 
Dr. Caleb Alexander, a Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health epidemiologist who studies drug safety, said it’s a better plan for states to use the settlements for multiple addiction response strategies. 
“No one in their right mind, I think, would argue that the money should all be dumped in a single bolus,” he said. 
But he also said overdose deaths continue to be an urgent health crisis requiring swift action. While he expects states to take time to thoughtfully set up their distribution processes, he was surprised more Mississippi money hasn’t been used to address the emergency. 
“I think three years and less than 1% represents a problem,” he said.
Another reason so little money has been spent to address addiction has been Fitch’s communications with cities and counties controlling opioid settlement dollars, according to public health experts. Representatives for the attorney general’s office have repeatedly told the local governments they don’t have to document their spending or use the money to address addiction in letters, emails and legal opinions.
Attorneys general in states such as Utah and North Carolina provided detailed guides for local governments on how to prevent more overdoses with the funds.
Dr. Rahul Gupta, the former Office of National Drug Control Policy director, served as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in many of the opioid settlement lawsuits. He said the local payouts weren’t meant to be spent secretly or for plugging budget holes. Rather, they were supposed to address addiction issues facing specific communities, while the state dollars could focus more on issues that impact large swaths of Mississippi.

“The whole goal of 100% of the funds is to use them in unison,” he said.
After her son died while struggling with addiction in 2019, Pine Belt resident Jane Clair Tyner has worked to make Mississippi addiction response resources more accessible. Her goal is to prevent more of the type of irreparable harm done to her family. 
She said she sees public service announcements throughout the state claiming that help is available for anyone with substance use disorder. But that wasn’t the experience she had with her son, at least for options that were affordable. 
Tyner said she wants Fitch and local government leaders to show a commitment and urgency to preventing more overdoses, and she wants them to be good stewards of this money.
“That is not at all what is being done,” Tyner said. “It’s being squandered.”

(Courtesy of James Leuschen for Congress)OMAHA — Another Democrat with ties to Washington, D.C. is running to be the Democratic nominee for Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.
James Leuschen, an Omaha native and a 20-year congressional staffer, told the Examiner this week that he is running because President “Donald Trump’s policies are hurting Nebraska families and hurting our community.” 
“We need to stop him,” Leuschen said. “This is an existential election.”
He joins a crowded field of Democrats trying to represent the Omaha-based 2nd District. The list of Democrats includes State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, business owner and political action committee co-founder Denise Powell, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades and Navy veteran Kishla Askins.
Leuschen moved back to Nebraska earlier this summer.
Mark Johnston withdrew from the Democratic field earlier this year because he said he lacked the infrastructure to raise funds. Evangelos Argyrakis said he was running as a Democrat. He has switched parties before, including to the Libertarian Party in early August. This week, he was registered as a Democrat. 
Leuschen has been working as an economic policy staffer for several House members over the past two decades. He served as a policy director for former Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, working to pass the Affordable Care Act under former President Barack Obama and expand the child tax credit. 
He also worked with the last Democrat to represent the 2nd District – the late U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford – to get an Omaha VA medical clinic built. Another connection between Ashford and Leuschen: John Ashford, his son, will serve as his campaign treasurer. 
“The VA medical facility in Omaha wouldn’t exist without James Leuschen,” John said. 
Leuschen is banking on his Washington experience to separate him from the other Democrats in the race.
“I have more experience to get to Washington and push back against the Trump administration … I know how Washington works,” Leuschen said. “I know how to lower costs for Nebraska families.”

That effort, if elected, will be his primary focus, he said, to “bring down costs for Nebraska families.” He says Trump’s tariffs and his budget and tax bill that passed earlier this summer are increasing the cost of groceries, utilities, and health care. 
Leuschen called Trump “the king of promising populist policies and … not following through.” He said he would push back against Trump’s ability to impose tariffs without congressional approval and work to protect Social Security and Medicare. Leuschen describes himself as a “common sense Democrat.” 
National Democrats are attempting to emerge from the political wilderness at a time when Trump and Republicans have made gains with blue-collar voters and voters of color.  The 2nd District race is increasingly critical for Democratic efforts to retake control of the House in 2026.
Nebraska Democrats are hoping that the backlash to the second Trump administration will help them make gains. 
Leuschen said, “Democrats get stuck in sort of technocratic or perfectionist policy” and look past what normal folks are looking for. He said regular people are primarily focused on the cost of living and “issues that folks talk about around their kitchen tables.” 
Part of what is luring more Democrats into the race is the announced retirement of U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. Another reason: Democratic House nominees have lost the 2nd District four straight times by single digits.  
Leuschen said the district, which includes all of Douglas and Saunders County and part of western Sarpy County, has an appetite to hold Trump accountable. The GOP’s contested primary is not as crowded, but it has two experienced candidates in Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha. 
National and state GOP strategists acknowledge that Democrats can win an open-seat 2nd District race, but they emphasize that Republicans can hold the seat with the “right candidate and the right messaging.” 
“This district has rewarded folks who have focused on solving problems,” Leuschen said. “That’s what I’m doing.”

Phil Murphy's administration has put more than $42 billion into state pensions since he took office in 2018, putting the funds on a path to recovery.","Gov. Phil Murphy's administration has put more than $42 billion into state pensions since he took office in 2018, putting the funds on a path to recovery. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Pensions are poised to top Gov. Phil Murphy’s list of achievements regardless of what else the term-limited Democrat accomplishes before he leaves office in four months.
Since his initial election as governor in 2017, Murphy has boosted annual pension payments — long ignored by governors of both parties — to record highs, reversing declines in a key metric used to measure the health of the funds that pay retirement benefits to public workers at all levels of New Jersey government.
“I think it’s probably paragraph one or bullet point one under making New Jersey a more responsible state again, a state you can trust,” Murphy, a Democrat, told the New Jersey Monitor in an interview.
New Jersey’s pension problems began their downward trajectory in 1997 under Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who cut about $590 million from the state’s annual pension payment — a roughly 86% reduction at the time — and borrowed nearly $2.8 billion to cover obligations and balance the state budget, including large income tax cuts.
Subsequent governors of both parties largely did not move to restore pension funding. Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat, made pension payments of just over $1 billion in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, but the havoc wrought by the Great Recession on New Jersey’s budget brought pension payments back down to zero for fiscal years 2010 and 2011.
Pension payments edged up under Republican Gov. Chris Christie, their growth aided by changes that placed more retirement costs on workers and delayed some pension-related cost increases. By Christie’s final budgetary year, the state was paying nearly $2.5 billion into its pensions, but even that was only half of what actuaries said was needed to restore the fund.
The disinvestment ballooned pension funds’ debts while denuding their assets and driving funding ratios — a key measure of pension health that compares a pension’s assets to its liabilities — down to among the lowest levels in the nation. Only Illinois had worse-funded pensions, according to researchers from the Pew Charitable Trusts, with that state’s troubles driven by a similar pattern of disinvestment and fallout from the Great Recession.
“Prior administrations, and even the first years of Murphy administration, needed to weigh pension funding versus other policy and moral funding issues such as K-12 aid, property tax relief, health care, support for developmentally disabled and other programs to support vulnerable communities,” said David Rousseau, a former state Treasurer under Corzine.
The level of contributions needed to restore fund health rose alongside debt. Had the disinvestment not occurred, administration officials and Murphy say, the state would only be required to pay about $1 billion annually. Instead, New Jersey actuaries say the state needs to pay roughly $6.9 billion.
New Jersey is expected to pay more than $7.2 billion into its pensions this year, including contributions from the state lottery. That would bring aggregate contributions under Murphy to above $47 billion, more than twice the $22.7 billion paid by other governors since the 1997 fiscal year.
“It’s like paying off a mortgage,” said Charles Steindel, who was the state’s chief economist under Christie from 2010 to 2014. “You’re paying off current unfunded liability.”











I think it’s probably paragraph one or bullet point one under making New Jersey a more responsible state again.


– Gov. Phil Murphy



Still, the health of New Jersey’s pensions remains precarious. Funding ratios across the state’s major pension funds, which, according to Treasury disclosures, cover more than 720,000 state workers, continued to decline until the state made its first full payment in the 2022 fiscal year.
Most of New Jersey’s pensions — and its large funds in particular — remain well below the 80% funding ratio experts consider indicative of a healthy pension fund, and those funds are expected to take a decade or more to reach that level.
Apart from two small pension funds that, combined, covered just 49 workers in the 2024 fiscal year, the state’s pension funds are not expected to reach a 100% funding ratio until about 2050, at which point the state’s annual pension payment would drop dramatically over only a couple of years, according to state actuarial reports.
But whether or not the pensions recover to that point will depend on how future governors treat the state’s pension obligations.
“I think we’ve succeeded in drawing a line in the sand above which we will have good behavior in the years ahead, regardless of Democratic or Republican administrations,” Murphy said. “We will put the sort of bad budget behavior in the past.”
The two major-party nominees vying to succeed Murphy, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R), have both said they would continue to fund state pensions if elected.
Though reducing pension payments would not immediately imperil benefits, cutting them may be difficult for the same reasons cutting Social Security is difficult at the federal level: Workers have paid into those funds for years or decades.
“A pension, after all, is nothing more than a deferred salary,” Steindel said. “You pay people their salaries.”
Economic shocks, whether from a recession or a more constrained downturn in financial markets, could also delay pensions’ recoveries. Pension funds are invested, and officials set a baseline expectation of 7% annual returns on those investments. Better returns could accelerate the recovery.
“Are the pension problems over? The answer is no,” Steindel said. “But the big deal — this heavy lift of this huge increase of state appropriations for the pension funds — that’s pretty much over.”
Pension payments increased under Gov. Chris Christie, but the payments were half of what actuaries said was needed to restore the pension fund. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Cost-of-living adjustments to pension benefits that have been paused for more than a decade under a bipartisan 2011 bill signed by Christie could also delay pensions’ eventual recovery by increasing the benefits New Jersey is required to pay to retired public workers.
Under the provisions of the 2011 law, pensions are barred from indexing the benefits they pay to workers until their funded ratio reaches at least 80%, a level the funds could reach late next decade.
Cost-of-living adjustments are not required, though the political pressure in their favor from labor unions and retirees who’ve unsuccessfully lobbied for increases is likely to be fierce. A retiree earning a $50,000 pension in 2011 would require $71,450 in benefits this year to maintain the same purchasing power.
It’s not likely future administrations would seek to raise pension benefits by such a degree, if only because doing so would likely strain state coffers and significantly delay pension recovery. How costly any future adjustments end up being would also depend on how the increases themselves are structured.
Reviving annual cost-of-living adjustments would drastically raise aggregate pension costs over the long run, Rousseau said, though other methods could be less costly.
“If it’s a one-time thing that’s then going to stay in the base, it’s expensive but not as expensive as doing it every year,” said Rousseau.
New Jersey’s spending on its pensions could save the state money elsewhere. Credit rating agencies’ view of the state’s ability and will to meet its debt obligations helps determine the interest rates charged on state-issued bonds. Higher ratings allow New Jersey to bond on more favorable terms, though the impact of prior downgrades was limited in New Jersey.
“Even when ratings were going down, New Jersey got decent interest rates since there were usually more bids for bonds than bonds being offered, which allowed rates to be negotiated down,” Rousseau said.
Ratings agencies have, among other things, cited pension payments under Murphy in a series of credit upgrades to the state. Those upgrades could also broaden the pool of potential bond buyers, since some investors are barred from buying lower-rated bonds, Steindel said.

A pending ""amendment"" to the BLM's Rock Springs management plan is likely to open previously undeveloped areas to oil and gas drilling, observers say.
The post Conservationists worry a Trump re-do will imperil Wyoming’s climate-stressed Red Desert appeared first on WyoFile .","RED DESERT—Wildlife biologist Tom Christiansen stood atop a ridge and gestured to a sea of sagebrush stretching south for miles before giving way to open patches of ancient seabed dirt and the vast Killpecker Sand Dunes.
All manner of plant and wildlife that reside in Wyoming’s Red Desert are adept at surviving the area’s sparse precipitation, poor soils and seasonal extremes. But a warming climate threatens to push this place to the brink of cascading degradation, Christiansen explained to a group of journalists during a tour of the desert by wing, tire and boot earlier this month.
“Normally, we’d have 80 or 90 fawns for every 100 [pronghorn] does,” he said, noting the ratio is down by about one-third for the Sublette Herd.
“There’s example after example of this kind of stuff, and you can see it in the vegetation monitoring,” Christiansen added. “It all goes back to the climate and how we’re drying out.”
Aside from a two-track road here and there, the vantage point where Christiansen and his audience stood revealed a vista devoid of rooftops, highways or power transmission lines — a place where only the hardiest of plant and animal species have evolved to flourish in the harsh, arid landscape. In this particular spot, an area on the northern edge of the Red Desert dubbed “The Golden Triangle,” resides the largest intact concentration of sagebrush and the largest concentration of greater sage grouse in the world.

The hearty sagebrush-steppe biome, a feature beyond The Golden Triangle and throughout the desert, also provides sustenance for thousands of pronghorn and mule deer that migrate out of the surrounding mountains and foothills to survive western Wyoming’s brutal winters, Christiansen explained. Retired after a 33-year career as a Wyoming Game and Fish Department biologist, Christiansen has studied everything “from mice to moose.” 
That biome is an increasingly rare commodity, he added, noting sagebrush-steppe habitat is disappearing and degrading at a rate of 1.3 million acres per year in western North America. The northern Red Desert, in his mind, is sort of an accidental ecological refuge.
“One of the reasons we still have this open landscape here — it’s not because of our intensive and intentional design to keep it wild and free and open. No,” he said. “It’s because the soil sucks and the precipitation sucks. 
“We’re already on the edge of existence,” Christiansen continued. “You can’t turn this into a wheat field. If you could, it would have been done. It’s not out of the goodness of our hearts that it’s still sage-grouse habitat.”

Yet the fate of this desert refuge will be no accident, according to Christiansen and the Wyoming Outdoor Council, which organized the tour. Christiansen serves as secretary on the council’s board of directors. 
The group, along with Friends of the Red Desert and others, are hoping to elevate the “invaluable” qualities of the Red Desert in the hearts and minds of the American public as federal officials retool a management plan that will determine the future of this place as it undergoes increasing climate-related threats such as wildfire and invasive plant species.
Resource management in limbo
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management updated its Rock Springs Resource Management Plan in December, establishing conservation, agricultural and industrial development and recreational priorities for some 3.6 million acres in southwest Wyoming, including much of the Red Desert.
The plan blocked about 1.1 million acres from new industrial-scale development, mostly in the northern portion of the desert — the accidental ecological sanctuary, as Christiansen suggests — in part because it already lacks oil, gas and mining infrastructure. Though the BLM initially wanted to block about 2.5 million acres, conservation groups still cheered the smaller implementation of rights-of-way “exclusion areas.”

There’s a logic, both conservationists and — at the time — the BLM agreed, in not only protecting the unique environmental and cultural values of the northern region, but in recognizing there already exists an industrialized east-west swath of oilfield, mining, pipeline and powerline infrastructure following Interstate 80 and the railroad “checkboard” in the southern portion of the desert. Even with the expansion of rights-of-way exclusion areas, about 75% of the 3.6-million-acre BLM Rock Springs Field Office management area is already leased or technically available for energy development, according to a Wilderness Society report.  
But the plan, after being savaged by conservative critics for being overly restrictive, is in limbo.
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has said the Rock Springs management plan will be “reviewed and, as appropriate, revised.” The BLM is “preparing to amend” the Rock Springs plan under the Interior’s Secretary Order 3418, which aligns the agency’s actions with President Donald Trump’s Unleashing American Energy executive order, according to the Wyoming BLM office. That process will begin “in the near future,” and will include an environmental assessment “with some public scoping,” an agency official told WyoFile via email. 
Conservation groups like the Wyoming Outdoor Council worry the Trump administration might exceed even what energy industry officials have asked for in terms of relaxing environmental protections. In addition to bolstering fossil fuel development on public lands, the administration proposes to roll back the BLM’s Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, rescind the Forest Service’s Roadless Rule, rescind the “endangerment finding” (the basis for limiting greenhouse gas emissions), to end a greenhouse gas reporting program and dozens of other actions to undo federal climate and conservation measures.

“The Trump administration has obviously led with prioritizing extractive industries over all other uses on public lands,” Wyoming Outdoor Council Conservation Director Alec Underwood told WyoFile. “Our concern would be … they might target some of those areas that are now closed to oil and gas via rights-of-way exclusions.”
Federal staffing concerns and new oil and gas assessment
When tour attendees climbed out of a gaggle of vehicles to chat with a local rancher near the Whitehorse Creek Overlook, a breeze was pungent with the sweet, earthy smell of sage. The unsettled sky above threatened to rain. But, true to the nature of this place, the timidly humid air merely added to the olfactory senses, and nary a drop was felt.
“It’s very dry — the driest we’ve ever seen,” said Jim Helleyer, who helps run a family cow-calf operation that, in part, relies on range in the desert. To cope, the ranch recently reduced its stock by half, he added.
A lifelong Lander resident and University of Wyoming graduate, Helleyer proudly described a recent upgrade to the ranch’s Red Desert grazing range, which encompasses a lot of BLM-administered surface. It included a water well that contributes to a small riparian area and new fencing (wildlife friendly, Helleyer noted) to keep cattle from trodding through it and to generally help sustain cattle grazing along with other natural resource benefits.

Even though the small project fit nicely with the BLM’s stewardship priorities, it took nearly 10 years to get permitted, he lamented. Outdoor Council members on the tour said they worry whether the BLM will be sufficiently staffed to steward whatever activities — and climate challenges — come next, given recent staffing reductions across all federal agencies via the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency program.
Asked whether there’s much oil and gas activity that intermingles with the ranch, Helleyer said no. Decades ago, Amoco drilled a deep well near here, he said, “and didn’t stick around.”
You can find evidence of similar attempts to tap petrol all over the northern Red Desert, according to those familiar with the place. If companies had struck paydirt, there’d be oil and gas fields here, they say.
But, just months after the Trump administration took office this year, the U.S. Geological Survey published a new assessment proclaiming a massive volume of oil and natural gas previously “undiscovered” and now “technically recoverable” under a large region of northwest Colorado and southwest Wyoming. The unrealized bounty, according to the report, stretches into the northern reaches of the Red Desert.

The potential riches weren’t exactly unknown, according to Wyoming oil and gas industry officials. It’s just that they were considered technically uneconomic to recover in terms of now outdated conventional methods.
“We’re constantly advancing [drilling] technology, and this new available science says that there’s a significant amount of recoverable oil and gas in the area,” Petroleum Association of Wyoming Vice President and Director of Communications Ryan McConnaughey said. 
Though perhaps not all of the reserves identified in the USGS assessment are economically viable to tap today, McConnaughey added, “that may very well change in the future. So we don’t want to see a potential area locked up forever.”
McConnaughey said he believes drilling can advance into previously undeveloped areas of the desert without compounding climate-related stresses that conservation groups point to as a reason for blocking the activity. “Oil and gas production in Wyoming is done in a more sustainable and environmentally sensitive way than anywhere else in the world.” 
For now, the northern Red Desert remains “remarkably intact,” the Outdoor Council’s Underwood said. 
“When you look at the various values up there, including the recreational opportunities, hunting, fishing and the cultural resources, what you see is one of the highest quality landscapes to go out and enjoy the outdoors,” Underwood said. “It also happens to be one of the most ecologically significant areas in the United States of America. If that place isn’t worthy of protection, I don’t know what is.”

Francesca Hong, a Madison Democratic Socialist, chef and bartender, is joining the growing Democratic field for governor — saying she hopes to be a relatable candidate who can bring working class people together to foster a government that works for them. 
Hong launched her campaign with a 90-second ad shot in the kitchen of L’Etoile, a high-end restaurant across from the Capitol in Madison and in the dining area of the adjacent restaurant Graze. Hong points towards the Capitol, which is labeled in the ad “MAGA-controlled Legislature,” and says that “a lot of people in that building don’t get why it’s so hard to get by right now.” 
“Working hard doesn’t mean you can always keep up. One wrong step can lay you out flat. This is by design,” Hong says.
Hong told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview that she is running because she sees the current moment as ripe for a “movement” for “building working class power,” as “more and more people are realizing that the system is rigged.”
“It’s about politics rooted in care — where we care for ourselves, our children, our small businesses and our workers. The movement requires building coalitions, meeting folks where they are, honoring and receiving all different types of talents and treasures and time that people are willing to give to engage with others. It’s happening, and it needs to happen faster here in Wisconsin.” 
Hong said she feels a sense of urgency because of the direction the Trump administration and Republicans are taking. 
“We have an authoritarian regime that endorses mass suffering, gutting food from children and gutting health care from working people and dismantling public education and programs,” Hong said. “It’s irresponsible to be thinking about incrementalism as a way to make this moment. I think it’s unrealistic to rely on incremental policy, and what working class people are demanding is that they have their needs met… Wisconsinites, they f-ing hustle, and they deserve a governor who is going to be working as hard as they are.”
Four other Democratic candidates are already in the open race, including State Sen. Kelda Roys of Madison, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley and Mukwonago beer vendor Ryan Strnad.
Two Republican candidates have entered the race on the GOP side so far: Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany has said he will make a decision about entering the race by the end of the month. 
Hong was first elected to the state Assembly in 2020, becoming the first Asian American to serve in the body. At 36, she is the youngest candidate to join the race so far.
Gov. Tony Evers’ decision not to seek a third term opened the way for a competitive primary. “I think that this is probably the only time where someone like me can run for governor and win,” Hong said. 
She acknowledged that her campaign will be different in style and substance from more traditional campaigns. “I think there’s going to be some skepticism that’s going to come from the establishment folks in political circles about some of the campaign strategies we may lean on, especially when it comes to creative digital,” she said.
Hong formerly owned Morris Ramen, a restaurant in downtown Madison she opened with Matt Morris and restaurateur Shinji Muramoto in 2016 and closed last year. She currently bartends and picks up shifts at another restaurant every once in a while. She is also a single mother who rents her home in Madison.
“It’s going to sound corny, but I really love this state,” Hong said. “It’s where I have failed and succeeded. When it comes to my culinary career or winning an election and being sent to the Capitol. It’s where George [her son] was born. It’s my parents’ home. They’ve lived here longer than anywhere else, and the state has given me and my family a lot.” 
She says she began considering running for governor after the recent state budget process.
Hong voted against the budget and called on other Democrats to do the same because it made no increases in general state aid to Wisconsin’s public schools. During her time in the Legislature, Hong has also been a champion for providing school breakfasts and lunches to all students free of charge. 
This session Hong joined the Legislative Socialist Caucus. She said she identifies as a Democratic Socialist. 
“That means I’m dedicated to building working class power where everyone has their basic needs met to be able to take care of themselves and the people that they love and their neighbors and somebody that they don’t know,” Hong said. 
Her campaign comes at a moment when other Democratic Socialists are running high-profile campaigns across the country. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders has been traveling the country on a “Fight Oligarchy Tour” that made stops in Wisconsin. In New York City, state Rep. Zohran Mamdani recently won the Democratic nomination for mayor.  
Hong said Mamdani’s message  resonated with her. 
“Mamdani has showed us that meeting voters where they are, building a diverse, multi-generational, multi-faith, multi-racial and multi-ethnic coalition is how you build trust with voters,” Hong said, adding that she appreciates his focus on  “affordability and concrete ways that government can do its job and be a force of good.” 
The policies that she has proposed in the Legislature have been “practical,” Hong said.
Hong was a leading sponsor on a state law that requires schools teach Hmong and Asian American history. Hong, the daughter of Korean immigrants, also helped launch the state’s first Legislative Asian Caucus alongside two of her new colleagues this session and has authored resolutions to proclaim 2025 as the year of the snake and celebrate 50 years of Hmong, Lao, Cambodian and Vietnamese people residing in Wisconsin.
This session, she has also coauthored a resolution to declare that Wisconsin have an Economic Bill of Rights and a bill to prohibit state employees’ cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in public buildings without a warrant. 
“We can make better possible when there are universal policies that support working class people — universal child care, guaranteed paid leave, fully funded public schools, access to capital for small businesses and investing heavily in a care infrastructure where we can take care of our seniors,” Hong said. “Regardless of political identity, these types of social insurance programs are designed to ensure that working class people can not only get by, but be able to take care of themselves and their families in the ways that they see fit.” 
Hong said it is “imperative” that Democrats flip the state Assembly and Senate to make progress towards those policies. New legislative maps adopted in 2024 brought that goal into sight for Democrats for the first time in many years.
Hong said she is going to do everything she can to support candidates running for the Assembly and to help flip districts currently represented by Republicans. The Wisconsin Legislature has been led by Republicans since 2010.
This will be Hong’s first time running for statewide office. Hong said she is anticipating an array of challenges for her campaign. She said she will continue putting in a lot of hours as a state lawmaker, and she may not be able to pick up as many shifts at Gamma Ray, the Madison bar she works at.
Hong said she is also committed to meeting people where they are in a wide variety of places, including bowling alleys and pro wrestling matches and the rodeo. She said those are the places where people might be willing to share their stories. 
Hong recalled stopping at a bar in Chippewa Falls. She said she got her usual Miller High Life, while two men next to her had a Miller Lite light and a regular Miller Lite. She said she made a comment along the lines of “you might as well just be drinking water at that point” and it led to a conversation about concerns one of the men had about hospital access in a part of the state grappling with recent hospitals closings.
“He was worried that his elderly mother, who was almost 90 and still drives herself to the hospital… she’s not going to get the care she needs,” Hong said. “That is real. Health care is very real for folks, health insurance is too expensive. We have policies that are going to help make health insurance cheaper, both for small businesses and for workers. 
Hong hopes she can give people the sense that “there’s somebody in their corner,” and show them that she “can be a strong messenger for helping people realize that together we can make better possible.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Usually, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office legally represents state government agencies. 
But in 2024, the Idaho Legislature and Gov. Brad Little approved a law to carve out the Idaho Department of Lands as an exception, directing the agency to have its own attorney that is independent of the Attorney General’s Office.
Then this June, the Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners voted to extend that exception to itself. The Land Board manages the state’s public lands, including deciding whether to sell land. 
Now, attorneys for the Land Board and Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador are squabbling about that policy in court — in an unrelated federal lawsuit about access to land in the Boise foothills, which neither agency is a party to. 
“The statutes setting forth who may represent state officers and entities in Idaho are not complex,” Labrador’s attorneys wrote. Quoting a state law about the attorney general’s duties, they wrote “The Attorney General has the authority and obligation to ‘represent the state and all departments … [and] boards’ in ‘all courts.’”
In response, attorneys for the Land Board and the Department of Lands argued Labrador lacked authority to even get involved in the federal lawsuit — and that the Legislature was clear about its intention.
“The Legislature expressly repealed the AG’s authority to represent the State’s interest in state land and timber matters,” they wrote.

 How did legal representation for the Land Board change?

The Land Board provides direction for the Idaho Department of Land’s management of about 2.5 million acres of state endowment lands.
Idaho Land Board votes to hire outside legal counsel instead of AG Raúl Labrador

Under the state’s constitution, the attorney general serves on the Land Board, along with several other state constitutional officers, including the governor. 
But until the Land Board’s new policy went into effect, Idaho’s attorney general also served as the Land Board’s legal counsel. 
This year’s decision for the Idaho Land Board to have its own attorneys is part of a years-long dispute over concerns that the attorney general had too much power in the governing body, even before Labrador took office in 2023.
In 2016, Idaho lawmakers considered amending the state’s constitution to remove the attorney general from the Land Board, the Spokesman-Review reported. That came years after the former attorney general, Lawrence Wasden, successfully sued the Land Board in 2010, the newspaper reported. 
Labrador was the only member of the Land Board to vote against approving the new legal representation policy, which states that the “land board shall be represented by its legal counsel in all courts.”
At the time, Labrador claimed the policy was contrary to state law and the state’s constitution. 
That dispute has boiled over into court.
 In court, Labrador’s attorneys claim new policy violates state law. Land Board’s attorneys argue the Legislature ‘repealed the AG’s authority.’

Labrador’s attorneys’ legal filing on Aug. 22 asked a federal judge to strike the Land Board’s request to file an amicus brief, which is when someone outside of a case wants to weigh in — because it was filed by the Department of Land’s in-house attorneys.

“The attorneys who submitted the motion for leave to file the amicus brief have no authority to represent the State or the Land Board in court, and the Attorney General — who does have that authority — did not authorize the motion,” Labrador’s attorneys wrote.
Labrador’s attorneys say that the Legislature “did not authorize the Department of Lands’ counsel to represent the State of Idaho,” and argued that the Land Board’s recent policy “violates the plain text of Idaho law — as the Attorney General advised the Board before it was adopted.”
In a legal filing last week, attorneys for the Land Board asked the judge to deny the Attorney General’s Office’s request, arguing that Labrador lacked authority and that the Idaho Supreme Court would be a better jurisdiction to consider the issue. 
“The allegation that the AG has supreme constitutional authority to represent the Land Board and ‘State of Idaho’ in state land matters is contrary to the Constitution, statute, caselaw, and the Idaho Rules of Professional Conduct,’” the Land Board’s attorneys wrote. 
The Idaho Attorney General’s Office could not be immediately reached for comment.

Organizations including the Idaho Conservation League, the Idaho Trails Association, the Sawtooth Society, Idaho Rivers United, the Sawtooth Interpretive and Historical Association, the Wood River Trails Coalition and the Environmental Resource Center have partnered with the U.S. Forest Service for the annual cleanup event.
The cleanup campaign began Monday and runs through Sept. 29.
For the event, interested volunteers can sign up online and pick the date they would like to clean up the Sawtooths.
Volunteers can select a cleanup mission in the front country (which organizers define as areas that can be reached by car, such as a developed campground) or in the backcountry (which organizers define as an area that can only be reached by foot, such as a trail in the Sawtooth Wilderness where motorized travel is not allowed).
“While this is a volunteer opportunity and there is a service aspect to it, this is also a great opportunity to go out and enjoy yourself on our public lands and appreciate those lands for yourself and reconnect with why public lands are so special and so important,” said Lexi Black, a Ketchum community engagement associate with the Idaho Conservation League. 
Black said the cleanup campaign is a self-directed effort where volunteers select the date and areas they would like to volunteer on within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area in Central Idaho. The online sign up page lists potential sites for volunteers to choose to protect, such as Pettit Lake or campgrounds at Stanley Lake. But volunteers can also select their own spot to clean up even if it is not listed.
Once they sign up online, volunteers will receive an email with instructions and an opportunity to pick up any materials they will need. 
Last year, 51 volunteers signed up for the cleanup. 
 How recreationists can ‘Leave No Trace’

This year’s public lands cleanup campaign could be especially significant because of federal cuts that reduced the U.S. Forest Service staff, and resulted in reduced hours and cutbacks at local offices in Idaho, including Sawtooth field offices.

One of Idaho’s crown jewels, the Sawtooth National Recreation Area includes jagged mountain peaks, crystal clear alpine lakes, wild rivers, miles of hiking trails and a diverse fish and wildlife habitat. Congress protected the Sawtooth National Recreation Area in 1972 to preserve it.
During the cleanup, volunteers may collect garbage, remove human waste and dismantle illegal fire rings and other artificial manmade structures.
Once they are in the field for the cleanup project, Black encourages volunteers to think about what their area would look like if the previous users practiced Leave No Trace principles. Leave No Trace principles for outdoor recreation include properly disposing of or packing out all waste, minimizing campfire impacts, respecting wildlife and camping and traveling on durable surfaces.
Essentially, Leave No Trace users seek to preserve the outdoors in its natural state and never remove anything natural from the environment.
“When they go through an area, we always encourage them to look for areas where other folks might have left a trace and then going through the effort of undoing that for them,” Black said.
The annual Sawtooth public lands cleanup campaign got its start in 2020. Since the beginning, volunteers have removed a total of 240 industrial size garbage bags full of waste from the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, organizers said.

Beginning October 7, Tennessee will no longer formally track or publicly report on the demographics of individuals interviewed, hired or promoted to jobs in the executive branch of state government. 
Also eliminated is a requirement that state agencies take steps to recruit, promote and hire women and minorities if they are underrepresented in the state government workforce.
The rule change drew pushback from Democrats, a minority on the Republican-dominated Joint Government Operations Committee.
Republican supermajority passes bills to “dismantle” DEI in state, local government

“We won’t have the data to know if there’s a problem or not,” said Rep. G.A. Hardaway, a Memphis Democrat.
The rule redefines Tennessee’s so-called equal employment opportunity plan, which spells out data-gathering requirements for the executive branch.
The data has been used for decades to guide government hiring managers into proactively taking steps to find, recruit and hire qualified individuals from demographic groups that are underrepresented in the government workforce.
The plan was formerly described as “a statistical document that identifies patterns in the participation and utilization of women, minorities, individuals with disabilities and veterans in the workforce.”
The new definition describes the plan as a “statistical document which identifies and analyzes patterns in the participation and utilization of certain groups in the workforce, based on federal and/or state law requirements.”
The rule change was necessary to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order ending affirmative action in government employment for women and minorities and recent state laws that bar Tennessee from taking race, ethnicity, sex or age into account in employment decisions, according to Melanie Koewler, deputy general counsel for the state’s Department of Human Resources. 
Koewler said the state of Tennessee will still be required to track its employment of veterans and people with disabilities under separate federal laws. 
“If you recognize there are deficiencies with women or other socioeconomic groups, will you be able to address those with affirmative steps or not?” Hardaway asked.
If lawmakers or members of the public want to learn how many women or minorities occupy state jobs, they will have to ask, Koewler said.
“Any information that is a public record any citizen can request a report,” she said. “We would receive it and process it just like any other public records request.”

(Photo courtesy of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library) The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in Medora may not open to the public until July 4, 2026, but the education and virtual learning events for the 26th president begin next week.
The library is hosting a virtual programming series featuring book talks, discussions of Roosevelt’s favorite recipes and a behind-the-scenes virtual tour of the library. 
Matt Briney, chief communications and marketing officer, said the library plans to hold about two virtual events every month, continuing after the facility opens. In addition, the library will hold in-person events once it opens, including single-day and multi-day symposiums, he said.
“You can fully expect a complete schedule from us moving forward,” Briney said.
The first event on Sept. 22 will feature David Gessner, a creative writing professor for the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and his book, “Leave It As It Is,” which retraces Roosevelt’s footsteps and conservation legacy. 
Many of the virtual events will feature authors who published books on the president that explored a specific time during Roosevelt’s life, such as the 1912 election, his time exploring the Amazon or his time at his North Dakota ranches, according to the event website.

Susan Sarna, senior curator of collections for the library, said those authors provide unique and detailed aspects of Roosevelt’s life, and together give a greater view of the former president’s life as a whole.
With the virtual learning series and exhibits, Sarna said the library is accumulating a one-stop shop of information and artifacts on Roosevelt. About half of the pieces that will be on display are from private collections and never before seen in a public setting, such as a diary Roosevelt kept after the deaths of his wife and mother occurred on the same day, Sarna said.
“At the library, we really try to start from scratch and go all the way through to after his death and how the world was affected by his death,” Sarna said. “No other site has the time, the square footage, to cover all of this and I think that’s one of the most exciting things is that you are going to get a full picture of this man.”
Construction of the library remains on track for its July 2026 grand opening, Briney said.

(Photo courtesy of Tandem Lens)Making America great again.
We’ve heard all about that for more than a decade, with political parties sharply divided over what constitutes greatness. Politicians will continue to grapple with that topic.
For my money, what makes America great again – while putting a shine on the Gem State that is as bright as the morning sun – are the roughly 300 people who attended the recent Idaho Nonprofit Center’s annual conference. Collectively, they had compelling stories to tell, a passion for their causes and a desire to make their communities a better place.
Bea Black is an Idaho success story worth celebrating

Donna Murray-Brown, who delivered a splendid keynote address, described what she saw on the faces in the crowd.
“I saw what I see every day in this sector: extraordinary individuals who believe with every ounce of their being that they can make a difference – and, that working alongside other visionaries, they will make a difference,” she said.
Murray-Brown has plenty of expertise in the field. She is principal of the Louisville-based DMB Coaching and Consulting, LLC, which helps strengthen leadership, culture and strategies for nonprofits nationally and beyond. She’s a former president and CEO of the Michigan Nonprofit Association and served as vice president of strategy and development at the National Council of Nonprofits in Washington, D.C.
“Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of speaking with and learning from nonprofit leaders across the country,” she said. “And no matter where I go, I see the same spirit I saw in Boise – people fueled by vision, driven by purpose and determined to serve their communities in ways that create lasting change.”
Over the two-day session, I met with some of those nonprofit leaders. There’s not enough space to mention them all, but the leaders I met had a clear purpose for their work and a vision for what they want to accomplish. They are dedicating their lives to solving real-life problems in their communities, and not waiting for the government to take action.
In Sandpoint, there’s an organization called Panhandle Special Needs, which focuses on training adults with disabilities in independent living skills that empower them to lead more self-sufficient and fulfilling lives. 
In Twin Falls, there’s a place called Valley House, a shelter for people facing homelessness. It’s not a hand-out, but a hand-up for those wanting to get back on their feet. There are strict requirements for their services, along with some tough love. The winners are those who come out at the other side as productive citizens.
I visited with a representative of the Salmon-based Mahoney House, which offers support and services to survivors of domestic violence (men included) and sexual assault. And there was the Mental Health Coalition of Teton Valley, which serves a gorgeous part of the state where too many suicides occur.
My experience over those two days was educational and exhilarating. But it was a mere sample of what Murray-Brown sees in her travels.
“The energy is inspiring, even as I know many are carrying heavy burdens: growing demand for services, limited resources, staff shortages and lingering burnout from years of serving through crisis,” she said. “My keynote was meant to encourage them and to offer practical ways to keep moving forward while serving the public good day by day.”
Yes, these are the people who are making America great – again and again. Murray-Brown hits the target with her thoughts.
“As a community called America, we all benefit from nonprofits. They are catalysts for change and the source of human solutions to our toughest challenges. And there is great power when each of us contributes – whether by giving our time, our treasure, or our voice – to fuel this work. That investment makes stronger communities possible in every corner of our country.”
Murray-Brown provides leadership and inspiration where it counts.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The chances that National Guard troops will soon patrol Louisiana cities grew more likely this week when Gov. Jeff Landry voiced support for President Donald Trump’s proposal to send the military into Democrat-led urban centers.
The governor has previously endorsed the president’s idea to direct the Louisiana National Guard into New Orleans, but he’s stopped short of asking Trump to do it. Landry, as governor, has the power to mobilize the Guard on his own and does not need permission or action from the president.
Echoing Trump, Landry framed the idea as a way to curb violent crime in cities, saying the troops can be used as a “force multiplier” to support local police.
“I think the president recognizes that our cities in America are way too violent,” Landry said. “People say, ‘Oh, this is a militarization of our big cities.’ Our cities are already war zones. Too many people are already dying.”
The governor’s comments came at a news conference Tuesday that detailed new state economic development efforts, which Landry said was another reason to curb crime in Louisiana. 
“You can’t have economic opportunity in the face of violence,” he said. “I applaud what the president’s doing. I think what he did in Washington, D.C., is remarkable.”
Trump used his federal authority to bring National Guard troops from around the country to the nation’s capital, despite opposition from Democrat D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. The forces on the ground include 135 military police from the Louisiana National Guard.
The president also supported mobilizing Guard soldiers to Memphis, Tennessee, which also has a Democrat mayor, at the request of Republican Gov. Bill Lee.  
Trump also ordered 700 Marines and more than 4,000 Guard soldiers into downtown Los Angeles to assist federal immigration enforcement against the wishes of Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats who have been highly critical of the president.
Chicago, Baltimore and St. Louis are other Democrat-led cities Trump has mentioned as possibilities for military deployments. 
For weeks, Trump has also mentioned New Orleans as a destination for military troops, and speculation intensified over the weekend after the Washington Post published leaked Pentagon plans to send 1,000 National Guard members to Louisiana. One of the documents, a memo from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, suggests the plan would only move forward if the governor first asked Trump to send the troops. The Guard would be sent to “urban centers” such as New Orleans and Baton Rouge to assist with law enforcement operations, according to the report.
Crime rates are already at a 30-year low in Washington D.C. and a 25-year low in Memphis, according to federal crime data. 
The same has been true for New Orleans, which has seen violent crime plunging over the past few years. Data the FBI has compiled show violent crime rates in New Orleans have fallen significantly over the past several years, reversing what was an upward trend that began around 2010. The federal database includes homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault in its violent crime category.  
Recent local data reveal a similarly significant decrease in New Orleans following a nationwide violent crime spike in 2022. 
So far this year, the city’s homicide rate is down 57% from 2022. Non-fatal shootings, carjackings and armed robberies are all down by even greater amounts, according to the Metropolitan Crime Commission, which analyzes New Orleans Police Department data. 
FBI data indicate a similar plunge in Baton Rouge, with violent crime falling 72% from 2022 through 2024. 
Other cities, such as Lafayette and Shreveport, saw violent crime increase over the same period 79% and 47%, respectively. However, preliminary figures for 2025 show significant improvements in both cities, according to the FBI database. 
Overall, the state reached a 25-year low in violent crime last year, which was 39% below the 1999 mark.
Landry framed the potential National Guard deployment to New Orleans as no different than its assignment after the Jan. 1 terror attack on Bourbon Street. Troops were used to help secure a large section of downtown ahead of the Super Bowl on Feb. 9 and again through Mardi Gras parade season from Feb. 26 through March 6. 
Landry already implemented an alternative to deploying the military in New Orleans by establishing a state police presence there last year. Troop NOLA is a detachment of roughly 40 Louisiana State Police troopers who supplement New Orleans Police efforts with additional patrols in the French Quarter and other neighborhoods. 
The latest proposal from the governor and president differs from the Guard’s time in New Orleans earlier this year, said retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who’s best known for taking over the military response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. 
The federal government designated the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras as top-level security events, while the proposed deployment would be for routine law enforcement, Honoré said. 
“It’s not a normal mission for the guard to do crime fighting,” the general said. “But they have provided security before.”
Troops would not likely be used in any sort of investigatory roles, Honoré said. They could detain people until law enforcement arrives, but their primary use would be as a visible crime deterrent, he added. 
Honoré said using Guard troops to detain or arrest people would likely require them to be armed, and he believes the ideal soldiers for that role would be the Louisiana National Guard’s military police batallion, which the governor sent to D.C. last month Honoré said. 
The use of National Guard troops to achieve political purposes, such as Trump’s immigration crackdown, crosses a line, the general said. 
“That’s the mission I’m most uncomfortable with,” Honoré said. “I’m concerned about the immigrant community and what’s gonna happen to our essential workers.”
The Louisiana National Guard did not respond to a request for comment for this report.
Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, who oversees tourism promotion for Louisiana, said he’s been fighting for years to bring crime down in tourist areas such as the French Quarter. Speaking on the phone from a promotional tour in Montreal, Canada, Nungesser said Landry’s establishment of Troop NOLA has been beneficial to tourism and questioned whether the military would be necessary.
“As far as whether it’s actually needed to fight crime, I don’t really have a strong feeling about it one way or the other,” he said. 
Nungesser said a better solution would be for the president to send more money to the state to fund law enforcement agencies here. 
“I think a grant from the president could do a lot more long term instead of just sending some troops down temporarily,” he said.

(Photo courtesy of State Senate Democratic Committee) City of Racine transit and mobility director Trevor Jung is running as a Democrat for southeast Wisconsin state Senate District 21 — the final of three districts that Democrats aim to flip in 2026 to help them capture the Senate majority. 
“I owe everything to my hometown,” Jung, who was born in Russia and raised in Racine, told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. “This is a special place with a lot of warmth and compassion… The state really has turned its back on places like the neighborhood that I grew up in, and whether you’re in Racine or Franklin or Greendale, the state has really neglected us.”  
Jung launched his campaign on Tuesday from the waterfront in Racine, and was joined by some current lawmakers, including Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee). 
“For me, this is about giving back to the place that gave me everything, and focusing on affordability, good paying jobs and making sure that we avoid what everybody is really sick of, which is the nastiness, the politics that too often turn people,” Jung said. 
Democrats, who haven’t held a majority in either legislative chamber in over 15 years, need to flip two seats and hold their current seats in order to win the Senate majority in 2026.  
Along with SD 21, Wisconsin Democrats are aiming to flip are Senate District 17, currently represented by Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), and Senate District 5, currently represented by Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield).
The 21st district’s incumbent, Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine), has served in the Senate for the last decade. He was first elected to the Senate in 2010, but lost a recall election in 2012.  Wanggaard was unchallenged during his most recent general election in 2022. In his 2018 reelection bid, he beat the Democratic candidate with nearly 60% of the vote.
But this year the district has changed considerably under new maps adopted in 2024.The current district encompasses part of Racine County, including the northern part of the city, and part of Milwaukee County, including Franklin, Hales Corner, Greendale and Greenfield. 
According to an analysis by John Johnson, a research fellow at Marquette University, the area encompassed by the new district lines leaned Democratic by 1 percentage point in the 2024 presidential election and by 2.2 percentage points in the 2024 U.S. Senate race. 
“You’re going to have to earn every vote,” Jung said of the district. “We’re going to be out there. We’re going to be listening to people. We’re going to be having conversations about what priorities residents of the district have, and we’re going to make sure that folks know that this is not about left or right. This is about building relationships and solving problems and having honest conversations about how the state can work together with the private sector and local government to make the quality of life better for people who live in southeast Wisconsin.”
Shortly after Jung’s campaign announcement, Wanggaard criticized the Democratic candidate in a statement.
“While Trevor is a nice, friendly, soft spoken young man, he uses that to hide his crazy liberal ideas that are more at home in San Francisco than in Milwaukee and Racine counties,” Wanggaard said. “Do not be mistaken — he is every bit an extreme Madison/California liberal as there is. He will vote in lockstep with everything the Democrats stand for — from raising taxes to allowing boys in girls’ locker rooms.” 
Wanggaard said in a statement that he plans to make a decision about whether to run near the end of this year. In his most recent campaign finance report, he reported raising only $0.80 this year.
“My timeline for making a decision whether or not to run for another term remains the same,” Wanggaard said. “As I stated last November, last January, and in July, I will continue to discuss another term with my family and friends.”
Wanggaard said that he has been receiving support and encouragement to run. 
“The priorities for the next term will remain the same, and what I’ve heard throughout the district — grow the economy, improve public safety, eliminate fraud and abuse, and protect the vulnerable,” Wanggaard said. 
Jung said he will run a positive campaign focused on the issues that matter to people in the district.  
“While my opponent is going to try to make whatever the national narrative is that’s focused on politics and name calling, we’re going to be focused on having a vision for making people’s lives better in Wisconsin,” Jung said, adding that it is still unclear who his opponent ultimately will be.
Jung said his campaign is about responding to people’s needs. 
“We’ve got dramatic cuts in shared revenue to make sure that we’ve got proper public services and public safety,” Jung said. “You have the state of Wisconsin ranking 27th in spending per pupil in our public schools, when just a generation ago, we were one of the best states in the nation in terms of making sure our students have what they need to succeed.”
Jung said the 2023 changes to shared revenue were a “Band-Aid” for local communities such as his and that he wants to ensure public schools have adequate funding. 
“We’re funding two education systems, and that’s not efficient,” Jung said, referring to the expansion of taxpayer-funded private schools — though he fell short of saying he’d want to see an end to the state’s school voucher system. 
Jung said in his current position in Racine city government, he and others have worked to expand transit service to the Social Security office as a way to ensure that elderly and disabled residents are able to access their benefits. He said they have also worked to prioritize savings, by helping bring down the cost of public transit, service, by ensuring people get the most out of public transit and sustainability, through environmentally conscious decisions. 
In his current role, which he plans to continue as he runs for state Senate, Jung said that he has seen the state of Wisconsin fail to be an adequate partner. 
“Instead of being an ally in that work to save local government money and to deliver better service, in large part, they’ve been an adversary,” Jung said. “They too often focused on national politics rather than getting stuff done for people at the local level.” 
This isn’t Jung’s first time running for public office. He previously served as the youngest member of the Racine Common Council, elected at age 23. He ran for the office after graduating from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a degree in urban studies and a focus on urban planning. 
His position on the common council, Jung said, “gave me a really good insight into, because of levy limits and revenue constraints and shared revenue, cuts that we had to make — really difficult decisions that we shouldn’t have had to make because of the state turning its back.”
Jung said that he has several priorities that he would want to work on in the state Senate that boil down to what he calls the “five Ts”: talent, training, transportation, technology and tourism. 
“If we get those right, Wisconsin can be one of the fastest growing states in the union,” he said. 
“What do we do to keep young people here and attract the next generation of talent in order to be a competitive place?” Jung asked rhetorically. “We need to work with organized labor and create a pipeline for the skilled trades so that people have access to family-supporting jobs.” 
Jung said that the state also needs to support public transportation, “whether that’s a robust public transportation system that gets people to work, doctor’s appointments, school or investing in alternatives to the personal vehicle, like transit and rail.” 
“We’ve got this new revolution in robotics and green energy and advanced manufacturing,” he added. “What can we do to make sure that Wisconsin is a place that is a leader in these new sectors?”
“This is the most beautiful state in the country,” Jung said, laying out his argument that tourism can do more for the economy. “Southeastern Wisconsin has an incredible architecture on the shores of Lake Michigan. We have a beautiful opportunity to make sure that visitors coming here can sustain the quality of life for residents who live here.” 
Jung said the state needs new energy and leadership that rejects “austerity” in favor of “investment.” 
“We need a positive vision for the future,” Jung said. “I’m excited about the youthful energy that we can bring to this campaign, but also looking forward to collaborating with people of all different walks of life to make sure that this is a well rounded and informed effort.”

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A coalition of Colorado environmental groups is crying foul over a settlement state officials quietly reached with Suncor Energy over the terms of a water quality permit for its Commerce City refinery earlier this year.
The settlement agreement stems from a challenge that Suncor filed to an updated water discharge permit issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment in 2024. The department’s Water Quality Control Division agreed in the July 23 settlement to suspend several key permit requirements, including a provision sought by environmental and community groups to require public notification any time a water quality limit was exceeded.
“The agreement walks that back significantly, and creates this complicated three-tiered structure on just how bad it has to be before there’s any public notification,” said Ian Coghill, an attorney with Earthjustice. “All that data is still going to be public, but it’s going to take a lot longer for people to be able to have access to it, or know that any exceedances or violations actually happened.”

The sprawling Suncor facility, one of Colorado’s largest sources of air pollution, has also drawn scrutiny in recent years for its repeated violations of water quality standards. Under the federal Clean Water Act, Suncor has a state-issued permit to discharge into Sand Creek, a 14-mile-long tributary that flows into the South Platte River just north of the refinery site.
Concerns from environmental groups center on pollutants like benzene and PFAS, a set of compounds known as “forever chemicals” that can lead to a variety of adverse health outcomes. Water regulators at CDPHE toughened restrictions on Suncor through a series of permit renewals beginning in 2021.
Critics, however, say the new restrictions didn’t go far enough. Represented by Earthjustice, a coalition that includes Denver Trout Unlimited, GreenLatinos, and the Colorado Sierra Club has filed its own appeal to Suncor’s March 2024 discharge permit, seeking lower PFAS limits, an accelerated compliance schedule, groundwater protections and more. That appeal, filed last year, is still pending.










Communities living in the shadow of Suncor have borne the brunt of toxic pollution for decades, and once again their voices have been shut out.


– Jessica Herrera, counsel with GreenLatinos


The same groups had also intervened as parties in Suncor’s own appeal process. But despite their intervenor status, they say they weren’t notified of CDPHE’s July 23 settlement with the company “until several weeks after it had been signed.”
“It’s really the behind-the-scenes way that all this has operated that’s one of the most concerning elements of it,” Coghill said. “No one’s approved it, no one was involved in the negotiations. It was just kind of dumped.”
Some permit conditions take immediate effect
In a statement, Kaitlyn Beekman, a Water Quality Control Division spokesperson, said the groups were aware of settlement discussions, and the agreement “ensures faster public health protections without the uncertainty of litigation.”
“This agreement is a win for Colorado and for nearby communities because it allows the vast majority of the new, stronger permit conditions — especially those tied to public health protections — to take effect immediately,” Beekman said. “This means stronger limits for PFAS and other organic chemicals, tighter inspection and public notice requirements, and greater accountability without delay.”
The settlement agreement will also allow Suncor to avoid the 2024 permit’s limitations on salt effluent. High salinity levels can impact wildlife and agriculture but “there are no acute public health effects associated with these levels,” Beekman wrote.
Denver Trout Unlimited has advocated for strengthened water quality protections for Sand Creek since an angler’s discovery of an oil spill near the refinery in 2011 led to scrutiny of the waterway’s benzene levels. Meanwhile, Suncor’s location amid the predominantly low-income and Latino neighborhoods on Denver’s north side has long sparked environmental justice concerns.
“Communities living in the shadow of Suncor have borne the brunt of toxic pollution for decades, and once again their voices have been shut out,” Jessica Herrera, counsel with GreenLatinos, said in a statement. “A closed-door deal that weakens permit protections is not just a bureaucratic failure, it is a betrayal of the Latino, immigrant, and working-class families who live, work, and play along these waterways.”

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)A Memphis lawmaker who opposes the deployment of National Guard troops to the city’s streets is urging Tennessee’s governor to place them under the “direct leadership” of the local police chief.
Democratic Rep. Jesse Chism said he recognizes the “seriousness” of Memphis’ public safety problems but wants to make sure troops ordered to Memphis by President Donald Trump, with the approval of Gov. Bill Lee, work with city police rather than undermining the force.
“The National Guard should supplement trained law enforcement, not replace it,” said Chism, chairman of the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, in a letter to Lee.
Memphis Police statistics show crime is down some 22% over the last year, because of new strategies and community efforts, he said.

“It is vital that these gains are not lost and that our city is not made to look or feel like a military state. Residents need to see that this deployment is about reinforcing their safety, not instilling fear,” Chism’s letter said.
Backed by Lee, U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty and federal officials, Trump set up a “Memphis Safe Task Force” this week and directed the Tennessee National Guard to the majority Black city. The force will include the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
Trump is further testing the bounds of the law by ordering troops to a city. At least one appeals court found his deployment of the California National Guard to Los Angeles amid protests over his immigration policies was illegal.
Chism is requesting the force be placed under the direction of Memphis Police Chief C.J. Davis. He points out Memphis officers have the expertise to deal with local residents and should lead a coordinated effort.
In addition, Chism asked federal and state governments to keep providing resources for law enforcement, community programs and other initiatives that strengthen schools and economic opportunities.
While Chism is calling for a “unified command,” Memphis City Council member Jerri Green, a Democratic candidate for governor, introduced a resolution with five colleagues urging Lee to reverse his stance and stop Guard troops from going into Memphis. 










Sending in troops is not a solution – it distracts from the real work of tackling poverty, strengthening families and creating opportunity.


– Memphis Councilmember Jerri Green


With a vote expected Sept. 25, she is backed by Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope (MICAH), Memphis for All, labor unions and Tennessee Immigration & Refugee Rights Coalition.
“Public safety comes from opportunity not occupation,” Green said in a statement. “Sending in troops is not a solution – it distracts from the real work of tackling poverty, strengthening families and creating opportunity.”
The League of Women Voters at local, state and national levels also opposed the deployment, saying Memphis is the “latest target” of the Trump administration’s attack on U.S. cities, despite a reduction in crime and without consultation with Shelby County and Memphis officials. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the move as well.
Shelby County’s Republican lawmakers have largely supported the troop deployment to Memphis.
Republican Rep. John Gillespie of Memphis filed House Bill 1445 Wednesday creating a fund to recruit law enforcement officers to departments with 10% vacancies. A release from the House Republican Caucus said Memphis hit a 20-year low in police staffing this year, according to the Memphis Police Association.
Lawmakers would need to approve the funding, and the state treasurer could invest money to bolster grants.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island had a higher percentage of children living in poverty in 2024 than any other New England state, according to an analysis of new census data.
Last year, the Ocean State’s child poverty rate rose from 13.4% to 16.3%, which made it the highest in New England. The Ocean State ranked 33rd nationally, according to new American Community Survey (ACS) data analyzed by Rhode Island KIDS COUNT.
The survey conducted annually by the U.S. Census Bureau counted 32,549 children experiencing poverty, up from the 26,901 children in 2023.
In 2024, the federal poverty threshold was defined as $26,650 for a family of three with one adult and two children, and $32,150 for a family of four with two adults and two children.
While this ACS data does not offer more granular breakdowns — like the percentage of children living in deep poverty, defined as living with less than half of the federal threshold — Rhode Island KIDS COUNT’s Executive Director Paige Parks said the news is still a cause for concern.
“I think sometimes in Rhode Island, we may feel like we are different than other states,” Parks said. “New England is very much known for doing well in many rankings, but this is where we are not, and we cannot ignore how many children are living in poverty in Rhode Island. I mean, we rank last in all of New England.”
KIDS COUNT examines the ACS estimates every year as one dataset which informs its annual Factbook, a compendium of data on children in Rhode Island and their wellbeing. The Rhode Island outfit of KIDS COUNT is one state-level affiliate of the nationwide Annie E. Casey Foundation, which collects data and produces similar reports in all 50 states. 
Children who live in poverty — especially those who experience poverty for a long time — “have many negative outcomes into adulthood that follow them,” Parks said.
“It is the indicator that is connected to every single data point that we collect in the Factbook,” Parks said.
A 618-page consensus study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2019 titled “A Roadmap to Reducing Child Poverty” concluded that the evidence is strong and plentiful for childhood poverty causing negative outcomes, rather than just being correlated to them. The report’s recommendations include expanding public health insurance, Earned Income Tax Credits, and food stamps to improve children’s outcomes.
The academies also estimated that childhood poverty dents the U.S. GDP by about 4% to 5.4% every year, which amounted to about $800 billion to $1.1 trillion in 2018. The expert panel cited Impoverished children growing up to earn less as adults, incurring criminal justice system-related costs, or suffering poorer health and its negative consequences as contributing factors.
Housing and inflation are culprits
A number of pandemic-era social supports expired in 2024, but the end of these subsidies did not alone create Rhode Island’s jump in child poverty, Parks said.
“The cost of housing continues to increase. Inflation continues to increase, and the pay that families are receiving just is not keeping up with the increase in cost of living in Rhode Island,” Parks said. “That’s a major contributor to this.”
According to the Factbook, the average rent was $2,316 for a two-bedroom apartment in Rhode Island in 2024. A person needed to make about three times the minimum wage — $44.54 an hour, or about $92,671 a year —  to afford that rent without being cost-burdened, defined as spending more than a third of income on housing. Overall, rents have risen by 17% since 2020.  
A slightly more recent annual report from Washington D.C.-based Out of Reach found Rhode Island renters need to earn $31.71 an hour, equivalent to $65,954 a year, to afford the typical two-bedroom apartment priced at $1,614 a month. That report also noted that costs swing by region, with places like Aquidneck Island exhibiting pricier estimates.
A report released Tuesday by the Providence City Council’s Housing Crisis Task Force further underlines the housing market’s escalating costs and pressures in the capital city, where there have been more than 24,000 evictions since 2020. 
“Nationally, households with children are twice as likely as other households to be threatened with eviction, and Black renters are about five times more likely to be evicted than white renters,” according to the KIDS COUNT Factbook.
Federal changes cause for concern
The survey data shows that the rate of children lacking health insurance also climbed modestly — a little under one percentage point — to 3.7% in 2024. That means about 8,087 young Rhode Islanders under 19 were without health coverage, although the state still ranks high nationally on this metric and is 12th overall.
A sea change in federal funding policies — including cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or colloquially as food stamps — has organizations like KIDS COUNT worried about the future.
Parks cited H.R. 1 — legislation perhaps best known by its sobriquet, The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as an uneasy omen for programs affecting children’s welfare. Signed into law on July 4, the bill package installs new requirements for social programs. 
An Urban Institute estimate from May 2025 found that about 13,000 Rhode Island families — including an approximate 3,000 families with children — would lose some or all SNAP benefits under the legislation’s expanded work reporting rules, for an average per-family monthly loss of about $227. Parks said these losses could then ripple to services like free school lunches and breakfasts, which often use federal markers like SNAP enrollment to determine eligibility.
“When we see national reports about how people in poverty are impacted by federal changes, I hope Rhode Islanders are not misled to think that they’re not talking about us,” Parks said. “We’re talking about us. We’re talking about our kids. We’re not doing great by our kids in poverty.”
Parks called for continued investment in Rhode Island Works, the state’s cash assistance program. Rhode Island Works now pays eligible families a monthly benefit that varies by income, housing situation and family size. Monthly earnings would include $701 for a family of two, $865 for a family of three, and $990 for a family of four.
Parks also said the state could improve its earned income tax credit of 16%, which lags compared to 40% in Massachusetts and Connecticut.

Lauren Boebert of Windsor, Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton, all Republicans, held a virtual press conference on Sept. 17, 2025, after they wrote a letter asking Colorado Gov.

Jared Polis, a Democrat, to call a second special session of the Colorado Legislature to address crime in the state. 
U.S. Reps. Lauren Boebert of Windsor, Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton said in a letter to Polis that the Legislature needs to make changes to several crime-related bills that have passed since the governor took office. The bills are related to cash bail, personal recognizance bonds, sentencing, competency to stand trial, and cooperation with federal law enforcement on immigration enforcement. 
The letter says surveys and data show that Coloradans don’t feel safe and worry about crime daily, and that the state and Denver by some measures are both ranked as dangerous.

“Coloradans know the truth — that despite the meager improvements in some crime rates from their record highs in 2022 — they still don’t feel safe in our state,” the letter says. 
State data shows that violent crime and property crime in Colorado have both decreased over the last two years. Denver data shows that violent crime and property crime have decreased in the city over the last three years as well.

In a press call on the letter, Evans said the crime issue in Colorado is unique to the state and is tied directly to Democratic policies approved at the state Capitol. 
“We can’t work together when the rhetoric coming out of the state Capitol says one thing, and the policies and the bills that get signed into law are 180 degrees the opposite direction,” Evans said. 
The Republicans’ letter said Denver was ranked as more dangerous than Washington, D.C., where President Donald Trump has activated National Guard troops to address crime in the city. Trump has deployed military troops to other American cities controlled, like Denver, by Democrats, such as Los Angeles and Memphis. Evans said that action in Washington, D.C., is unique to that city because it is “at all times under federal control,” and federal law is “really clear” that “federal troops can’t engage in policing actions” unless there are specific circumstances and exceptions. 
“You have to have state governors involved any time that there’s a National Guard deployment for a policing action, which of course brings us right back to the fact that we have a governor who is unwilling to engage in making communities safe and unwilling to allocate the resources necessary,” Evans said. 
Bill passed with bipartisan support
U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, refuted the claim that crime in the city she represents is growing. She said in a statement that “my colleagues from outside of Denver should worry about the crime rates in the cities they represent.”
The letter came in response to a Sept. 8 post on X from the Weld County Sheriff’s Office alerting residents that a person being released from custody presented “a potential danger to the community” after courts deemed him not competent to stand trial. The post attributed the release to House Bill 24-1034, which limits how long a person can remain in custody once deemed incompetent. 
That bill passed the Legislature with bipartisan support and passed the Senate unanimously. The Republicans said in their letter that they “could not help but respond with bewilderment” to Polis’ reaction in a post on X calling the Weld County situation “absolutely unacceptable,” even though he signed that bill into law. 
Boebert, Crank and Evans said they would have welcomed Polis naming public safety as a subject of the special session he called in August to address an approximately $750 million gap in the state’s budget that followed the passage of the federal tax cut and spending law, also known as H.R. 1, in July. 
In a statement, Polis said he will collaborate with local officials and the federal congressional delegation to improve public safety, even if that means “fixing or eliminating any bills that are hurting public safety.” Evans said addressing public safety needs to be a collaborative effort, too, but added “the state does not want to be part of that team” and that “the rhetoric is all right, the policies are all wrong.” 
The Republicans in Congress who wrote to Polis “are attempting to distract Coloradans from issues they own,” Polis said, noting that cuts in H.R. 1 are what led to the recent special session. The Trump administration is withholding public safety funding from Colorado, Polis added, which he said he hopes will draw “the same outrage from these members of Congress.”
“Many of the laws in this letter had bipartisan support at the legislature. I’ll partner with anyone to reduce crime, and we are actively working with District Attorneys, the Colorado Department of Human Services, and legislators on a policy solution related to HB24-1034,” Polis said in a statement. “I would encourage these members to do their part to support Coloradans and help fix the problems within the federal government.”
In a letter responding to Boebert, Crank and Evans, Polis said they should focus on avoiding a government shutdown and advocate the extension of premium tax credits to avoid rising health insurance costs. He mentioned the federal public safety funds being withheld from Colorado and asked them to “get to work and get us our public safety money.”
Crank said in the press call that Polis is “gaslighting and blaming it on someone else” by focusing on federal policies in his response. He said if Polis does not have enough funding to reduce crime, “it’s because he didn’t make it a priority.” Concern about crime is “one of the top issues” Crank said he hears from constituents in his district.

The street — a thoroughfare for Lewisburg — is home to restaurants, art galleries, boutiques and more. (Photo by Chris Jackson/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia is so poor, miserable, and misgoverned that it bans abortion and suicide in desperation to make people live here. Former Gov. Jim Justice paid people and businesses to move in. As for the current Gov. Patrick Morrisey, I suspect his proposed artificial intelligence farms are part of a secret plot to manufacture and sneak in robot West Virginians programmed to vote anti-woke.
If our governors and Legislature were actually awake, maybe they would get the bright idea to populate West Virginia adequately by improving the quality of life here. It would also encourage incoming people to stay, like doctors with foreign backgrounds who often hang around only a few years (including my cancer doctor who grew up in Brooklyn).
But don’t expect West Virginia’s stuck-up ruling class to do much for the rest of us: It is not their way. Instead, we must find our own ways, whatever they might be. Here are a few West Virginia ways of life that I recommend for us common folk:
Country
If you were raised like me (or even weren’t), you might be attracted to country roads. I grew up in a house built by my father and maternal grandfather (no running water, electricity or phones). My father worked in the coal mines while my mother kept house, gardened and raised chickens and hogs. And surprise, they had no bills and a growing bank account.
With no television or electronic games, my three brothers and I spent half our time in the woods and streams or reading. My mother canned stuff, and we all fished and hunted (everybody a crack shot). We ate a healthy, even gourmet diet. When was the last time you had crackling cornbread, squirrel and dumplings, or delicious roast groundhog (vegetarian-fed)?
If you have or can acquire land in the country (often cheaply), hold on to it: It is a key to independence and happiness for you and your immediate family and to pass on to following generations. It’s still possible to live a good country life, especially now with all the modern conveniences and automobiles.
I know families who live in quiet parklike settings, grow their own pesticide-free organic vegetables, have full freezers of deer and turkeys they shoot from their back porch, and spend much of their time outdoors. They tend to work at jobs as needed and change often, since most pay low wages anyhow.
Today a lot of country property comes with housing, sometimes old and rundown, but it can be fixed up gradually. If there’s no housing, you can install a trailer permanently or while you build your own dream house and shape the landscaping, preferably away from floods and forest fires caused by the changing climate.
Computers
 My ideal house is something like the Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois., by architect Mies van der Rohe, or Fallingwater in Mill Run, Pennsylvania, by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. These are architectural masterpieces, originally very expensive, now museums. Just their cost of admission is out of my price range ($42 for Fallingwater).
But potentially, with West Virginia’s tradition of glassmaking, supply of cement and rock (even mine waste) and heavy equipment, affordable housing using similar techniques and fire-resistant materials could be mass-produced here, maybe in modular form. With cement or steel girders, such houses could be firmly attached to hillsides and perched on ridges.
This upscale lifestyle, supported by computers and other communication devices, might attract retirees, business owners and remote workers escaping cities and seeking cool breezes and scenic views. Yet some parts of West Virginia are close enough to big cities like Cleveland, Ohio; Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C., for occasional commuting.
As mentioned above, West Virginia has an incentive program to attract remote workers and business owners (see Ascendwv.com). They should check tax laws to avoid possible income tax in two states. Unfortunately, people already living in West Virginia are not eligible.
Communes
At the other extreme are the many West Virginians struggling economically or personally. Sometimes they can find or create communal living arrangements, where people share equally, socialize and provide each other moral support, reflecting some old West Virginia traditions. These arrangements typically need startup funding or property from governments, charities or individuals but then are expected to sustain themselves.
An example is the network of well-run drug-and-alcohol rehab centers that have grown up in West Virginia in response to the state’s drug crisis, now staffed mostly by people in recovery and attracting clients from other states. It is uncertain how much this vital program will be damaged by expected cuts in Medicaid.
Other examples (not necessarily found in West Virginia but needed) are more long-term or permanent, like homes for autistic adults or the homeless, communal farms or other co-ops, employee-owned businesses and retirement centers owned and run by the seniors themselves.
Some people join communes just because they enjoy the lifestyle, like the flower children of my generation or the lost and lovelorn of today. The more the better, I say.

(Campaign photo courtesy of Hendrickson)Calling affordability the top issue, child care provider and advocate Corrine Hendrickson launched her bid Wednesday to be the Democratic nominee for the state Senate’s 17th District seat in 2026.
“A lot of people are getting priced out of their homes because property taxes are too high, because our state refuses to invest in the local school districts, the local fire districts, municipalities, highways, counties — and so the local people have to absorb the cost themselves or go without the services,” Hendrickson said in an interview.
“And so communities that are doing OK are increasing their own property taxes, but it’s pricing people out of their houses,” she added. “Other communities can’t do that.”
The 17th District encompasses Crawford, Grant, Green, Iowa and LaFayette counties and the southwestern corner of Dane County. Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) currently represents the district.
Hendrickson formally filed to run Sept. 2, but rolled out her campaign Wednesday with an announcement in a local park in her hometown of New Glarus.
Two other Democrats have announced campaigns in the district: State Rep. Jenna Jacobson (D-Oregon) and Lisa White of Potosi, a small business owner.
Hendrickson said most of the counties in the district have lost population — a symptom of unmet needs in rural Wisconsin.
“Something that we really need to look at is the infrastructure of our communities and how do we bring businesses and people back in and how do we make them vibrant again,” she said. “And we really just need to start investing — and that means fair taxation.”
It also means funding services such as quality child care, Hendrickson said, rather than saddling parents with the entire cost.
Hendrickson has been steeped in the child care issue, operating a home-based family child care business for 18 years, and founding with her friend and care provider colleague, Brooke Legler, the advocacy organization WECAN to push for more state child care funding. The name stands for Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed.
While the 2025-27 state budget included some direct child care funding for the first time, Hendrickson is among providers who were frustrated that the amount — $110 million for one year — fell short of the nearly $500 million that providers spent months campaigning for. After the budget was signed, she closed her child care operation at the end of August because she felt the state support wasn’t enough to sustain it.
While virtually every Democratic hopeful for the state Legislature has mentioned child care support as a talking point, Hendrickson said she brings to the subject “the personal lived experience” of a care provider.
But she said she has also gained knowledge from care providers and child care experts across the country and studied how states such as Vermont and New Mexico have begun to include broad support for child care in their state budgets.
“I have the opportunity to talk to people within the actual field and bring the ideas to them and say, ‘how does this actually work for you in your business?’” Hendrickson said.
As a candidate her agenda is broader than child care, and as an elected official, she would consult the expertise of others on public policy, she said.
“We shouldn’t have to be experts in everything,” Hendrickson said. “We should know experts in everything that we can then turn to and ask — whether they voted for us or not — like, is this a good idea? Does it solve the problem? Does it create new problems?”
Hendrickson served one term on the New Glarus school board from 2020 to 2023. She also has been involved in her community, leading Cub Scouts, active in parent-teacher organizations and building WECAN with Legler, she said.

Instead of recommending broad availability, the agency restricted access only to people aged 65 and older, or those under 65 with a high risk condition. And just last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nodded to vaccine restriction in his new MAHA report, which is essentially a list of 128 health priorities he hopes to achieve.
Now, there is another major group that will have limited access to COVID-19 vaccines: health care workers.
The shift in vaccine policy is more than just a technical medical change. RFK Jr. has disrupted the evidence-based, established process for approving and determining who will benefit most from vaccines. Although RFK Jr. pledged he wouldn’t “take away anybody’s vaccines,” the recent actions by the FDA will significantly decrease health care personnel access to COVID-19 vaccines. That carries real risk for patients and providers alike.
I know this because I’ve experienced it firsthand.

As an infectious disease physician in Colorado, I have treated many patients with COVID-19. Patients like Ms. J., who was a young healthy college soccer player who ended up on a ventilator in the critical care unit. Thankfully, she survived with the support and dedication of her critical care team, specialty physicians, nurses, advance practice practitioners, and respiratory therapists.
Health care personnel, or HCP, treated her each day in homemade hair covers, eye shields, respirators and gowns even before the availability of the vaccine. We did it to uphold our duty and calling to heal the sick and save lives, and to improve the health of individuals and communities throughout Colorado and beyond. However, being on the front lines is not without risks. After watching patients and sometimes even staff acquire infections in the hospital, I now specialize in infection prevention, and am on a mission to ensure health care is safe for patients and HCP alike.
The evidence is clear that HCP are known to be at increased risk for exposure to COVID-19. Assisting patients with activities of daily living and working in a hospital — rather than other health care settings — has been shown to be particularly high risk for acquiring COVID-19. In addition, health care workers can serve as a source of transmission of COVID-19. This can lead to outbreaks of hospital-acquired COVID-19 among staff and patients in hospitals.
COVID vaccines have proven safe and effective for preventing symptomatic COVID-19 among HCP. Vaccination of HCP helps reduce staffing shortages and maintains a healthy workforce, ensuring that we do not see a repeat of hospital beds filling up and patients denied care. It is true that many HCP choose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, with coverage rates between about 15% to 30%.
However, they had a choice. We should not take immunization choices away from those who would choose protection. If it is not recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, whose members were ousted and replaced with new decision makers, several of whom have made anti-vaccine claims, many health care facilities may not not offer it due to logistical considerations of requiring a prescription, eligibility determination, and cost.
Amidst all these changes, there has been limited explanation to the reasoning behind major decisions such as leaving out HCP when it comes to COVID vaccine recommendations.
Did they deliberately leave HCP off the list? Or was it an oversight due to side-stepping the previously established, rigorous, multistep vaccine approval and recommendation process?
Similar to the move to restrict COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women — despite the overwhelming evidence that the vaccines are safe and effective — there has been very little explanation given to the public for not recommending COVID-19 vaccines for HCP. These inconsistencies in the new recommendations underlie the importance of a transparent and evidence-based vaccine approval process.
It is unclear if the ACIP will amend the list of high risk conditions. If they do, they should remember the nation’s doctors, nurses, caretakers and other critical HCP. Due to the increased risk to HCP and to patients, COVID-19 vaccines should be available to all HCP who would like protection. Their choice — and protection — should not be taken away because of political beliefs without scientific evidence.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Early voting begins Friday in Virginia’s high-stakes general election, opening a six-week window for voters to cast their ballots in races for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, all 100 seats of the House of Delegates and some local offices. This year’s early voting period arrives with several notable changes to state election law, including a shorter registration deadline and new reporting requirements for provisional ballots.
According to the Virginia Department of Elections, in-person early voting runs from Friday, Sept. 19 through Saturday, Nov. 1. The agency reminds Virginians that every county and city must offer early voting, but that voters are only allowed to vote early in the jurisdiction in which they are registered.
On the gubernatorial ticket, Democrat Abigail Spanberger faces Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee. For lieutenant governor, state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, is opposed by conservative radio show host John Reid. In the attorney general contest, incumbent Republican Jason Miyares is being challenged by Democrat Jay Jones.
This fall marks the first general election under a revised registration schedule. The deadline to register is now 11 days before an election — Oct. 24 this year — instead of the 22-day cutoff that applied in previous years.
After that date, Virginians can still register through same-day registration, but those ballots are cast provisionally and verified later. Registrars must also now report the number of provisional ballots at the precinct level, a change state officials say will improve transparency.
Early voting locations vary by locality; some jurisdictions operate multiple satellite sites with different hours of operation, while others rely on a single registrar’s office. Voters must bring an acceptable form of identification to cast a ballot, though anyone lacking an ID can still vote provisionally. 
Curbside voting remains available for Virginians over 65 or those with disabilities, and voters with visual or manual dexterity impairments can mark absentee ballots using electronic tools. 
Absentee voting also begins Friday, with ballots mailed to military and overseas voters as well as those who have already requested them. 
Any registered voter can apply for an absentee ballot online, by mail, or in person without giving a reason. The deadline to request a mailed absentee ballot is Oct. 24. Completed ballots may be returned by mail, delivered to a registrar’s office, or placed in designated drop boxes during the early voting period or on Election Day. To be counted, mailed ballots must be postmarked by Nov. 4 and received by noon on Nov. 7.
Election officials and candidates alike are urging Virginians not to wait. 
“With early voting in Virginia’s general elections beginning on Friday, I encourage all eligible Virginians to get registered, double check their registration status, and make a plan to vote early or on Election Day,” Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, said in a statement. 
The expansion of early voting in Virginia is still relatively new. Lawmakers approved no-excuse absentee voting and broadened access to early in-person voting beginning in 2020, aligning the commonwealth with many other states. 
Studies have found those reforms boosted participation. Analysis by the Center for Election Innovation & Research shows that voting before Election Day has steadily increased since the changes, helping reduce long lines at polling places and raising turnout overall.
In fact, Virginia’s turnout in the 2024 presidential election was estimated at 73%, well above the national average. Election experts say the extended early voting period, combined with mail-in options, made it easier for people with demanding schedules or long commutes to participate. 
“The one thing we know above all about early voting is that it’s very popular. A lot of people would prefer to vote ahead of time, particularly if they don’t have to provide an excuse,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.  
“The people who vote early are usually the most intense partisans, people who vote Democratic or Republican, no matter when they voted,” Farnsworth said. “This enables the campaigns to focus on those voters who are less likely to turn out, or maybe more persuadable. And so it serves a great purpose for the campaigns to have those partisan voters locked in early.” 
Analysts also note that the elderly and military families have made particularly heavy use of absentee ballots in recent cycles.
“It’s important to know that this is a great assistance to older voters who might find it more difficult to get to the polls on Election Day in terms of transportation, and to military voters, who are away from their home precincts,” Farnsworth said. 
​​State officials are hopeful that momentum continues this fall, given the stakes of the 2025 election. Control of the governor’s mansion and the full House of Delegates will shape policy decisions on issues ranging from taxes and health care to education and criminal justice. The election is also widely seen as a referendum on the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House. 
With party control in Richmond potentially up for grabs, both Democrats and Republicans are mounting intensive get-out-the-vote efforts designed to maximize early turnout and bank votes before Nov. 4.
The Department of Elections is directing voters to its website to check registration status, locate early voting sites and find acceptable forms of identification. Those with questions can also call the department at 1-800-552-9745 or the nonpartisan Voter Assistance Hotline at 844-482-8683.
Election officials stress that voters should not assume hours and locations are the same as in past years, since each locality sets its own rules within the state framework.
Key dates remain front of mind for election officials: the Oct. 24 registration and absentee ballot request deadline, the Nov. 1 close of early in-person voting, and Election Day itself on Tuesday, Nov. 4, when polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.

(Courtesy of Project:HOMES)Over the summer, the University of Richmond launched the Live and Learn website, a new feature of a study examining the connection between housing segregation and educational inequality in Richmond and its surrounding areas released last year. 
The new interactive site will help inform educators, experts, and policymakers about the local links between housing and education.
Michelle Quach, a recent graduate from Richmond, was one of the students who worked on the project. The Henrico County native helped with the visualizations and came away from the experience feeling “grateful,” she said. 
“It was really cool for me, specifically to have the opportunity to work on this project, especially as an undergrad,” said Quach, who graduated with a double major in health studies and geography and a minor in data science. I think I was the youngest person in the room at times, and it was still really cool to be able to be part of these conversations and to understand a little bit more about where I grew up and where I came from.”

Some of the visualizations revealed unequal educational opportunities and outcomes for some Central Virginians, which were linked to housing segregation and funding disparities. Researchers focused on eight localities in the metro Richmond area: Richmond, Henrico, Chesterfield, Hanover, New Kent, Goochland, Powhatan, and Charles City.

The second release of the study, based on data collected between 2011 and 2024, revealed several notable data points that showed the region becoming more racially and economically diverse, Black students facing racially disproportionate discipline and being excluded from school at twice their enrollment rate, and schools in higher-poverty areas having higher percentages of inexperienced or provisionally licensed teachers.
Researchers also found that four school divisions — Charles City, Chesterfield, Henrico, and Richmond, all with a majority of students of color — had inadequate funding to meet the national average assessment scores for their students.
Tom Shields  — one of the co-authors of the report — said that researchers have known that localities are often segregated by race and income, but the pairing of the data was able to reveal how zoning also “creates segregated schools.”
The report lays out a series of policy recommendations to address housing and educational equity at the state and local levels. Lawmakers have already been working on some of these ideas. 
Researchers recommend that lawmakers remove education barriers by creating more regional school choice options, helping students learn multiple languages by teaching them in two languages, and combining school districts. 
Another idea is to address equity concerning resources by allocating more funds to schools with a high proportion of disadvantaged students, offering incentives for top teachers to work in schools that need them most, and improving how the state measures school success. 
Over the past three years, Gov. Glenn Youngkin, state lawmakers and education leaders have taken major steps to improve public K-12 education through investments and reform efforts. However, what remains unsettled is overhauling the funding formula, which determines how schools receive their funds.
Va. lawmakers prepare to overhaul decades-old school funding formula

Under the researchers’ list of housing policy ideas, one recommendation is to fund the 5,000 Families program. The idea is a bipartisan state budget amendment that Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, have carried.
If implemented, the program would provide rental relief to certain families with school-age children to prevent displacement during academic years.
Researchers also suggested more robust funding for Richmond’s Eviction Diversion Program, and adjusting local zoning to allow more flexibility on the types of housing that are allowed to be built. They recommended redrawing the school zone lines to “help break the neighborhood-school segregation link,” the study states.
Zoning is a local issue that city councils and boards of supervisors have authority over, but state lawmakers have proposed ways to incentivize stagnant boards to allow for increased density in certain areas. The legislation advanced through this year’s legislative session for a time before eventually being voted down. 
“We’ve been relying on localities to do this for long enough,” HOME policy director Laura Dobbs recently told The Mercury, of localities’ efforts to support affordable housing. “They just aren’t going far enough or not keeping up with the demand.”
The organization was involved in crafting the report and interactive website and has lent its policy insights to state lawmakers when working on legislation. 
Shields concurs that “state laws are where we could get a lot more bang for our buck.”
But there are still local tools to utilize, he added. 
For instance, the report recommends that the Richmond region adopt small area fair market rents that could allow Housing Choice Voucher administrators to calculate payment standards at the zip-code level rather than the metro levels. The idea is that it would help ensure payment standards reflect local markets and help voucher-holders find homes. 
In the meantime, nonprofit organizations like Housing Opportunities Made Equal, have stepped in to take on discrimination cases for voucher-holders or help them find homes when they struggle to land one.
Virginia housing nonprofits and residents are monitoring federal cuts, fraying state safety nets

Another recommendation was a bill that cleared the legislature this year before meeting Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s veto pen. Carried by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, the bill would have allowed localities a right of first refusal when subsidized housing is up for sale in order to help preserve it from becoming market rate. 
Youngkin explained his veto as an “intrusion” on local government. If such a bill passes the legislature again next year, gubernatorial candidates Winsome Earle-Sears or Abigail Spanberger could potentially sign or veto it. 
The study team consisted of researchers from the University of Richmond, Virginia Commonwealth University, the Partnership for Housing Affordability, Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia and the Commonwealth Institute.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Last week, George Mason University Board of Visitors’ Rector Charles “Cully” Stimson pushed back against calls for him to resign, spurred by the publication of a report entitled “Uncovering Radical Efforts to Disguise DEI” by conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, where he serves as senior advisor to the president.
George Mason University rector rebuffs Va. Senate Dems’ request for his resignation

As rector of GMU’s board, Stimson bears the highest fiduciary duty to Virginia’s largest public university. That duty is clear: board members must act with loyalty, prudence, and care — always prioritizing the university’s interests. This responsibility is not optional; it is the core principle of governance for every nonprofit and public university board.
Stimson — who said he is “fully walled off from Heritage’s work concerning education policy” — wants us to see him as just another citizen sharing his personal views and professional background. However, the rector of a public university is not a private citizen. He serves as the presiding officer of the board and has a fiduciary duty of loyalty that requires him to prioritize the university’s interests over his own or those of his employer. To act otherwise undermines the gravity of the office he holds.
Yet in his recent letter responding to concerns from the Senate leadership,  Stimson demonstrated a profound misunderstanding of what fiduciary duty of loyalty requires. His defense — that he has compartmentalized his work at the Heritage Foundation and that he cannot be held accountable for the writings of his colleagues — misses the point entirely. 
Fiduciary duty isn’t about building walls in one’s head. It is about eliminating conflicts so deep that the public can be certain your judgment is undivided. His claim that he can simply “check his personal views at the door” is not a standard recognized in law or governance. Fiduciary loyalty requires more than a promise of compartmentalization — it requires the elimination of conflicts that erode public trust.
The Heritage Foundation, where  Stimson serves as senior advisor to the president, has publicly attacked George Mason University by name and called for federal funding to be withdrawn. That stance directly harms the very institution he is sworn to protect. No “wall” can resolve that conflict. The duty of loyalty requires he choose: serve Heritage or serve Mason. He cannot do both. Whether Mr. Stimson himself writes Heritage’s attacks on Mason is irrelevant. Fiduciary duty is not limited to specific topics. When your employer seeks to cut off federal funding to the university you oversee, your loyalties are irreconcilably divided.
What makes this lapse worse is that  Stimson is not just an ordinary person; he is an attorney. Thirty years in the Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps should have taught him that duty involves not only avoiding impropriety but also the appearance of it. Stimson highlights his JAG service and his unanimous confirmation in Richmond, but these credentials make his failure to understand the duty of loyalty more, not less, concerning. Senate leaders have now clearly stated that his dual roles present “an untenable ethical conflict.” Credentials alone do not resolve conflicts of interest.
Nor is this the first time  Stimson has betrayed a core ethical duty. In 2007, while serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs, he publicly encouraged corporate clients to penalize law firms representing Guantánamo detainees. The backlash was swift and bipartisan, leading to his resignation. At that time, NYU law professor Stephen Gillers coined the term the “Charles Stimson Rule”: never attack lawyers for representing unpopular clients.
The New York Times took a firmer stance in a 2007 editorial titled ”Apology Not Accepted.” As the Times stated: “It is hard to render a convincing apology when you are not really apologizing…” 
The editorial condemned his “loathsome attempt to punish lawyers.” It argued that his “appalling behavior should not be overlooked by the relevant bar disciplinary committee,” emphasizing that the legal profession imposes “a higher duty on those holding public office to obey proper standards of behavior.”
Back then, he criticized lawyers for defending detainees; today, he undermines the university he is sworn to defend. Different stage, same failure to understand ethical responsibility.
Stimson also fails to mention another revealing part of his record: During President Donald Trump’s first term, he was twice nominated to serve as General Counsel of the U.S. Navy. Both times, his nomination did not advance to the Senate floor for a vote, even in a chamber controlled by his own party.
Stimson assures us that the  board is “securing the University’s funding.” Yet his employer has publicly urged Congress to withhold federal support from GMU. No Rector can credibly claim to protect funding while working for an organization that calls for stripping it away.
The Senate leadership clearly stated in their recent letter that this represents an “untenable ethical conflict.” Stimson claims he can separate his roles, but fiduciary duty involves unwavering loyalty, not divisions.
The Times’ 20-year-old judgment still holds today. For George Mason University and for Virginia, the message needs to be even clearer now: “Excuses not accepted.”

(Courtesy of the campaign team of Daira Smith-Rodriguez)Another anti-establishment Democratic candidate has entered the race against long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. 
Daira Smith-Rodriguez, a union member and U.S. Air Force civilian contracting officer, officially launched her campaign on Thursday, though she filed to run with the Federal Election Commission last month. 
In her campaign launch video, she shared stances — such as calling what’s happening in Gaza a genocide and what’s happening in America an oligarchy — similar to those that have led many progressive Mainers to be drawn to Graham Platner, another Democratic candidate who had a splashy campaign launch in August and has been endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
The two candidates also have teams that include progressive strategists with records of successfully running against establishment Democrats. Like Platner, Smith-Rodriguez’s campaign is staffed by some of the same people working for New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. Her team also includes pollster Celinda Lake, a prominent Democratic pollster who worked for former President Joe Biden’s campaign.
Platner has also tried to appeal to Maine’s independent thinking by rejecting the label of liberal while embracing a working man’s pitch to appeal to some supporters of President Donald Trump. 
Smith-Rodriguez’s pitch to Mainers strikes a similar tone, with a focus on fair labor and affordability. But she’s also focusing on other issues that have been of concern to MAGA voters, such as “Big Food,” national security and government oversight.  
“Food labeling, broken. Food safety, broken. Supply chains, broken,” she said in her campaign video. “And nobody is looking out for us. But keep your receipts. Send them to me. I can tell you exactly why it’s making you sick, and why it’s so damn expensive.”
While Smith-Rodriguez highlighted her ties to the military like Platner has, she’s doing so with a particular focus on national security. 
“My dad was a test pilot. My husband is a Maine Air National Guardsman and I’m a decorated civil servant,” she said. “National security is the family calling.”
She said she did “aggressive auditing and oversight” for the Air Force and vowed to do so in the Senate. She’s against American tax dollars being used to send weapons to Israel. 
“America is not a business, no matter what they tell you,” she said at the conclusion of her video. “We’re dreamers and patriots and families. We’re one people with one more chance.”

(Photo by Lourdes Balduque/Getty Images)Kitty Larochelle, who has worked for more than 30 years in child care and now serves as director of The Growing Years Early Childhood Center in Manchester, traveled to Washington, D.C., alongside child care workers from across the country this week to meet with federal lawmakers about the challenges facing early care and education.
She said taking care of her staff, both in terms of mental health and wages, was the biggest concern she brought to lawmakers.
“Because as you know we’re not making a million bucks here,” she said.
Larochelle said she met briefly with Sen. Maggie Hassan and spoke more in depth with her team and the teams of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Rep. Chris Pappas. She said they were “eager to hear from us” and she’s hopeful the three — all Democrats — will be able to work with Republicans on bipartisan solutions, particularly increasing staff wages. The trip was organized by Save the Children, an international humanitarian organization.

“I’ve been raising the flag about that for a few years, that we’ve got to take care of the workforce or there will be no workforce,” she said, “Child care is the workforce behind the workforce. We support all businesses in taking care of children of all ages and from all over the state. So if we’re not here, then parents can’t go to work and can’t do their jobs and can’t pay their rent and can’t do a lot of things.”
Research backs this up. A February report from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute suggests New Hampshire businesses lost between $36 million and $56 million in 2023 because of staffing disruptions from employees forced to quit or decrease hours to take care of children. Families in New Hampshire lost an estimated $114 million to $178 million in earnings because they couldn’t find suitable child care, the report found. The report also estimated this may have resulted in $9 million to $14 million in lost state and local tax revenue.
State lawmakers recently appropriated $15 million in federal funding for child care workforce development to alleviate staffing challenges that drive up child care costs. However, Larochelle doesn’t think that’ll be near enough.
Larochelle said it takes around $50,000 to $60,000 to give each of her staff (26 employees) a $1-per-hour raise. The Growing Years is a large operation, caring for around 100 children ranging from infants to 9-year-olds. She said roughly 85% of the center’s revenue goes to payroll. But the dollar amount of the appropriation isn’t the only problem. Questions remain about how much flexibility the state will have to apply the federal funds toward workforce grants. 
Larochelle also hopes the USDA, which provides free and reduced-price meals for some of the children at The Growing Years, will increase its support.
“I would love to see the USDA just cover all early childhood programs,” Larochelle said. “Period. End of story. Forget the eligibility piece, because during COVID, they took care of public school. They just said everybody was eligible for free meals, yet we had to prove eligibility continually throughout all of that time and again, there is such great importance to the first five years of life, so if we’re able to ensure that we’re providing healthy meals and snacks to kids, that’s going to help their overall health and learning capabilities and help to support their early childhood journey.”
The average cost to put an infant in center-based child care in New Hampshire was $16,040 per year in 2023, according to a recent report from Child Care Aware of America, a nonprofit that surveys child care supply and pricing. That’s 11% of the median annual income ($150,029) for a New Hampshire married couple and 36% of the median income ($45,086) of a New Hampshire single parent. For a toddler, the average annual cost was $14,870.
“​We cannot expect that parents can continue to pay more and more and more for the rising cost of child care solely,” Larochelle said. “That’s a big ask of parents.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/childcaretoyskids-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 05:56:28.598563

That’s according to the new Mississippi River Basin Drought and Water Dashboard.
Dozens of metrics are used to determine drought and that can make it complicated to measure and track. But it’s a bit easier now thanks to the new government dashboard, which tracks drought across the Mississippi River Basin. 
“Drought doesn’t obey county or state boundary lines,” said Kelsey Eigsti, who co-led the tool’s development out of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. “It crosses regions and so being able to look at that broader regional context is really important for communicating about drought.”
The river is one of the world’s busiest commercial waterways and provides drinking water to more than 50 cities. Two years ago it hit historically low water levels, which caused commercial ships to run aground and lowered the river’s water quality. 
That was the impetus for making a dashboard that provides past, present, and predicts future drought conditions across the basin. 
Users can view data for the entire basin, zoom into smaller sub-basin regions, view original data sources, download map images with custom boundary lines and otherwise customize the data to communicate the state of drought in the basin. 
The dashboard is a multi-agency collaboration between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Geological Survey and state and local partners. 
The new tool was announced to the public Wednesday at the annual meeting of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative and is online now at www.drought.gov/watersheds/mississippi-river-dashboard. 
The data it uses already exists: for example, it has a section of current drought conditions in the basin, which it pulls from the U.S. Drought Monitor, a nationwide tool to assess dry conditions. But the dashboard gathers data from scattered sites in one place for the first time. 
“There’s a lot of data out there,” said Sean Duffy, executive director of the Big River Coalition, which represents the Mississippi River navigation industry. “We want it more streamlined. We want it where it’s easier to understand, so a 12-year-old can understand it and to put it into one website, instead of having to glean it from 10 or more, which often still happens.”
Eigsti said the dashboard is primarily aimed at drought communicators — such as local governments and journalists  — but was also created with decision-makers in mind. A separate tab on the website has educational information on the impacts of drought. 
Missouri State Climatologist Zack Leasor said the new dashboard makes his job of drought assessment and communication easier.
“This is the entire hydrologic cycle,” he said. “You’ve got precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and then lots of hydrologic data as well. So kind of a one-stop shop here.”
Leasor said having access to basin-wide data at his fingertips is useful because how those metrics look in one area can have downstream — and upstream — effects to the rest of the region. 
“Impacts don’t always align exactly where the drought’s occurring, especially when we talk about economic impacts and large-scale hydrologic impacts,” he said. 
Those impacts can be significant. 
For example, when water is low, it can degrade the river’s water quality. In the lower Mississippi, low flows can cause saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico to run upriver, causing issues for people who depend on it for drinking water. 
To mitigate those impacts, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sometimes constructs an underwater barrier to stop saltwater intrusion. That had to be done in 1988, 1999, 2012, 2022, 2023 and 2024. 
The barriers, along with low water levels more generally, can slow down barge movement on the river. 
Approximately 175 million tons of freight are moved on the upper Mississippi each year, according to the National Park Service. 
“The Mississippi River is the primary transportation mechanism for agricultural products from the central United States to the rest of the country, the rest of the world,” said Texas State Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon. “When the river is running low, barge traffic is limited or potentially shut down completely, and makes it quite challenging for producers to get their products to market.”
Duffy said low — and high — water events have been happening more frequently.  But communicating these trends, which he refers to as increased “climate variability,” to people in the navigation industry can be challenging. He’s hoping the easy-to-use dashboard, which he helped beta test, makes communication easier. 
“There are very few people that really look at the water and understand the system and the places where you’re exposing your king,” he said. “The channel is king, and everything we do is to try to protect it and keep everything moving.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)Attorneys representing the state of Ohio and women’s health clinics made oral arguments Tuesday over whether other provisions in the state’s 2019 six-week abortion ban law can be maintained, even though the ban itself has been struck down.
During oral arguments in front of three judges from the First District Court of Appeals, both the state and attorneys for the reproductive health clinics made it clear that the six-week abortion ban itself was not up for debate, and was settled when a trial court struck down the ban in October of last year.
The trial court’s decision came after 57% of Ohio voters approved a reproductive rights amendment to the Ohio Constitution in 2023.
The 2019 law had been blocked by courts from the time it was signed by Gov. Mike DeWine until the U.S. Supreme Court struck down nationwide abortion rights in 2022. When the June Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade came down, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost moved quickly to implement the state’s six-week ban, which included no exceptions for rape or incest.
The ban was in place for several months before being held up by an Ohio court injunction. As that court case was proceeding, voters passed the new amendment, after which the trial court concluded the law had been rendered unconstitutional.

While the state is not fighting the rejection of the six-week ban, the reason the state Attorney General’s office appealed the case was to fight for the other provisions in Senate Bill 23, the state law under which the six-week abortion ban was enacted.
Yost’s team argues provisions such as record-keeping for abortions could stand on their own.
The state has consistently argued that the other provisions can stand under a “severability” clause of the law, which is a legal way of allowing certain parts of laws to stay in place even if another part of the law has been removed or successfully challenged in court.
“There’s basically two issues (in the appeal),” Deputy Solicitor General Stephen Carney told the district court on Tuesday. “What did the legislature intend and, separately, are (the provisions) capable to function by themselves.”
Carney argued the language of the state law clearly states if anything in the law is declared invalid, “it shall not affect any other sections.”
The specific language states that the law’s provisions are “severable.”
“In particular, it is the intent of the General Assembly that any invalidity or potential invalidity of a provision of (the law) is not to impair the immediate and continuing enforceability of the remaining provisions,” according to the Ohio Revised Code.
The state also pointed to previous record-keeping regarding abortion that existed in state law before the Dobbs decision and the six-week abortion ban.
Attorney Cassie Mitchell, of the law firm WilmerHale, represented Preterm-Cleveland, Planned Parenthoods in Southwest and Greater Ohio, Women’s Med Group Professional Corporation, and Northeast Ohio Women’s Center, along with an individual physician in the case, in partnership with the ACLU of Ohio.
Mitchell argued that provisions that were included in Senate Bill 23 along with the six-week ban should also fall because they are directly connected to enforcement of the ban itself.
Laying out the provisions at dispute in the case, Mitchell said four “just clarify the scope of the ban,” including definitions of the law, the fact that the ban didn’t apply to ectopic pregnancies, and that a pregnant individual wouldn’t be held liable, among other provisions.
“Those don’t just stand on their own; they have no meaning without the rest of the ban in place,” Mitchell told the court.
Another four provisions specify punishments for violating the six-week ban, including felony charges and license revocation for medical professionals.
“S.B. 23 created a new punishment for failing to check for cardiac activity that was the same, very severe punishment for actually performing an abortion after the detection of cardiac activity,” Mitchell said. “It was clearly intended to prevent any runarounds of the six-week ban … and it didn’t exist prior to S.B. 23.”
For the state, Carney said a ruling by the appeals court saying the entire law is struck down not only would be “doing something radical that no one has ever done before,” but would also have consequences in other cases on completely different topics.
“You’re threatening how courts review environmental laws or anything else, and then we’re going to feel obliged to appeal that because we’re here because of the effect on all state laws,” Carney said.
The deputy solicitor general went on to say the rejection of the six-week abortion ban section of the law “did not create a super abortion exception” that applies to all provisions of all Ohio laws.
“All we’re asking is that you follow the rule of law, the normal rules of the road that every plaintiff has to meet, versus creating this radical roadmap for everyone to strike down a lot of state laws,” Carney said.
On behalf of women’s clinics, Mitchell said the court could allow closure in the case by giving its ruling as the final say, rather than sending the case back to the previous court to re-litigate a case that has already been down that road.
“This court can resolve this now, it can give plaintiffs and their patients the certainty they need as to what the requirements of Ohio law are, and we can just all move on,” Mitchell said.

(Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images)When the U.S. Department of Justice asked Kansas Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab to turn over a copy of his state’s full voter list, including sensitive personal data, he responded with gratitude for the Trump administration.
“We appreciate the efforts of DOJ and other federal partners to assist in ensuring states have access to federal resources” to maintain voter rolls, Schwab wrote in an Aug. 21 letter to the agency.
But Schwab did not provide the full data the Justice Department wanted. Instead, the second-term state secretary of state and candidate for governor wrote that he was “initially” giving its lawyers only publicly available voter information.
As the Trump administration demands that states turn over voter data, some Republican state officials are pushing back.
At least four states with Republican chief election officials have offered public data but not the sensitive information — driver’s license and partial Social Security numbers — sought by the Justice Department, even as they take pains not to pick a fight with President Donald Trump. Another has refused to turn over any data.
One state so far has given the federal government everything and another appears likely to follow.
On Friday, Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales, a Republican, confirmed he provided the Justice Department with all the requested data, making Indiana the first known state to hand over sensitive personal information. And in South Carolina, the state Supreme Court has cleared the way for election officials to share its data.
Many Democrats and even some Republicans fear Trump wants to use the voter data to build a federal database of voters he can use to target political opponents or hype rare instances of noncitizen voting. At the same time, supporters of the effort say the Justice Department is focused on maintaining accurate voter rolls.
For Republicans, the demands pit the traditional conservative belief in states’ authority — and their skepticism of federal power —  against the will of a president who holds a vise-like grip over their party. They also come after Trump spent years advancing the false claim that he won the 2020 election.
The Justice Department, controlled by Trump allies, has contacted over half of the states and signaled it will eventually reach out to all of them, ensuring more GOP officials will likely confront choices over what to give the administration. Their responses will go a long way in determining whether the department succeeds in obtaining personal data on tens of millions of American voters.
“It raises concerns to me about trust, about transparency, about the potential for politicizing a process that folks on all sides of the political spectrum need to feel comfortable and confident is being handled appropriately,” said Matt Germer, director of the Governance Program at the R Street Institute, a center-right think tank in Washington, D.C.
Germer, who calls himself a pro-democracy conservative, said others like him, as well as many Democrats, “have some worry that this is less about building a case against specific incidents of fraud and more about sowing fear in election processes.”
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

While Republicans have taken varied approaches to the demands, Democratic election officials have largely spurned them. They warn Trump is encroaching on the authority of states to run elections and are fearful of how he may use the data. Some Democrats have pointed the administration to publicly available data, but others have fully refused the requests.
The Justice Department on Tuesday announced it was suing the Democratic secretaries of state in Maine and Oregon over their refusal to provide voter data. The lawsuits mark the first legal challenges the department has brought against states in its effort to obtain voter registration records across the country.
At least 27 states have so far received a demand from the Justice Department for voter data, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which tracks the requests. Fifteen of the states were won by Trump.
Along with Kansas, Republican election officials in Alaska, Florida and Utah have so far offered only public voter data. New Hampshire’s Republican secretary of state has turned over no data, citing restrictions in state law, and Texas officials have said they can’t currently provide a copy of their voter rolls because of ongoing technical upgrades.
Since taking office in January, Trump has tried to exert unilateral control over elections, mostly unsuccessfully. Federal courts blocked an executive order in March that attempted to require voters to prove their citizenship when registering. He threatened to sign another order purporting to ban mail-in ballots but has so far not followed through.
The Constitution gives states the authority to administer elections and Congress the power to step in and set national election standards and regulations. Federal legislation that would implement a proof-of-citizenship voter registration requirement passed the U.S. House this spring, but hasn’t advanced in the Senate.










President Trump today in 2025 is more popular, more influential, more powerful within the Republican Party than he was in 2017.


– Former Kentucky Republican Secretary of State Trey Grayson


Even without a nationwide proof-of-citizenship requirement, the Trump administration is assembling a patchwork operation to find noncitizen voting, which is an extremely rare phenomenon. As the Trump administration presses states for voter rolls, it confirmed last week that the Justice Department is sharing voter data with the Department of Homeland Security, which runs a powerful online search program that can identify noncitizens and verify citizenship.
Several election experts question whether the Justice Department has the authority to demand the voter data and say it’s misinterpreting federal law. “There is zero federal law that entitles the Department of Justice to that sensitive data,” said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research.
The Justice Department said in a statement to Stateline that Congress gave the department authority under multiple federal laws to ensure states have proper voter registration programs and procedures to keep voter rolls free of ineligible voters. The requests for voter rolls have been made under that authority, it said.
“States simply cannot pick and choose which federal laws they will comply with, including our voting laws, which ensure that all American citizens have equal access to the ballot in federal elections,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said in the news release announcing lawsuits against Maine and Oregon.
Navigating DOJ demands
In New Hampshire, Republican Secretary of State David Scanlan has twice refused the Justice Department. Scanlan first declined to provide the state’s voter list in July; after the agency pressed him again, he sent a four-paragraph letter reiterating his position.
Dhillon responded to Scanlan in a letter Aug. 18 that the department was entitled to the voter data under federal record retention laws. She wrote that the agency needed the data to determine whether New Hampshire is complying with the Help America Vote Act, a 2002 federal law that revamped election administration in the wake of the disputed 2000 presidential election.
Scanlan has said New Hampshire law is clear in only permitting the secretary of state to release voter lists, without sensitive personal information, in limited circumstances. Political parties, political committees and candidates may request the list; other outside organizations and agencies, like the Justice Department, cannot.
Scanlan, first elected in 2022, has avoided politically charged rhetoric during the dispute over the voter list. He will be up for reelection next year, but not before voters. In New Hampshire, the Republican-controlled legislature elects the secretary of state every two years.
In an interview with Stateline, Scanlan said he’s approached the situation in a “matter of fact” manner.
“I know other states may have different statutes that allow them to provide that information and beyond that, I really don’t have strong feelings about where this goes,” Scanlan said.
“I’m just going to administer the New Hampshire statutes, taking into consideration what may apply at the federal level through statute or through the courts,” he said. “But for the time being, I think our position is pretty clear.”
Schwab, the Kansas Republican secretary of state, will face voters next year — but as a candidate for governor. A former state lawmaker first elected secretary of state in 2018, he is running in a large Republican primary field where candidates, including him, are competing to link themselves to Trump.
But Schwab has also long taken a clear stance against election denialism and knocked down false claims about Kansas elections. In 2022 he won a primary election, 55%-45%, that pitted him against a Republican activist who promoted conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.
As the Justice Department push for voter rolls moves forward, Schwab has attempted to find a middle ground. He provided only Kansas’s public voter data, but held open the possibility of turning over more. And in his August letter to the department, he praised the Trump administration’s priorities on election security.
“We agree that routine voter maintenance is critical to ensuring accurate voter rolls and confidence in elections,” Schwab wrote.
Schwab declined Stateline’s interview request. In response to questions, John Milburn, a spokesperson for the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office, wrote in an email: “We remain in conversation with the DOJ and have no further information or comment at this time.”
Trey Grayson, a former Republican Kentucky secretary of state in the 2000s, said if he was in office, he could see potentially providing publicly available voter data to the Justice Department. The department is an entity “you have to take seriously,” Grayson said, though he added he wished it would disclose more about how it plans to use the information.
There’s also politics.
“President Trump today in 2025 is more popular, more influential, more powerful within the Republican Party than he was in 2017,” said Grayson, who sits on the board of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonprofit organization that works to build confidence in elections.
Indiana, South Carolina support data sharing
Morales, the Indiana Republican secretary of state, invoked Trump when he announced last week he had shared full voter data, including driver’s license and partial Social Security numbers, with the Justice Department.
“If providing the Justice Department information can help Indiana with ensuring our voter list is accurate and up to date, we will do so. We will take all the help we can get. I am proud to work with President Trump and his administration to strengthen election integrity,” Morales said at a news conference on Friday.
A former aide to Mike Pence while he was governor of Indiana, Morales was elected in 2022 after calling the 2020 election a “scam” and writing the “outcome is questionable.”
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

Morales made the disclosure about the voter list in response to reporters’ questions, but he had called the news conference to highlight an alleged case of noncitizen voting by a man with a Mexican passport who had voted six times since 2018. He didn’t identify the man, and criminal charges don’t appear to have been filed.
The decision to turn over the data disappointed Julia Vaughn, executive director of Common Cause Indiana, a voting rights group. She said her organization is prepared to challenge in court any unlawful sharing of the voter list for illegal purposes.
“We’re concerned about his willingness to allow the federal government to interfere in the administration of Indiana elections,” Vaughn said.
In South Carolina, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster went to court, fighting to allow officials to share the full voter list with the Justice Department. After the South Carolina State Election Commission received a request for the voter list in August, a registered voter sued to block its release.
Last week, the South Carolina Supreme Court, in a decision on procedural grounds, cleared the way for the state to hand over the data while the lawsuit plays out in court.
Speaking with reporters earlier this month, McMaster cast the sensitive data as already in the possession of the government and pointed out that the federal government created Social Security.
McMaster noted the South Carolina Constitution contains a right to privacy, but said the Justice Department’s request wasn’t an illegal overreach. “The federal government does have the authority to ask for these things,” he said.
But as the Trump administration seeks voter lists, Germer, of the R Street Institute, voiced concern about what the demands could mean for the future. The collection effort is beginning to set a precedent and a mechanism for future data grabs, he cautioned.
“It’s important to remember that these kinds of actions don’t occur in a vacuum,” Germer said, adding that “we live in a world where one president takes action and the next president builds upon it.”

No one had published a full accounting of the extraordinary amounts of public money spent on housing since 2020. We pieced it together. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont poured hundreds of millions of dollars into housing during the pandemic. What has it built?.","This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.

After the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Vermont’s long-simmering housing crunch reached a boiling point. Home prices jumped dramatically, the state’s rental vacancy rate constricted, and its unhoused population tripled. 
During that time, Vermont leaders funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into affordable housing development — including from federal pandemic stimulus packages, state surplus revenues, and other sources — an opportunity dubbed by many as “historic.”
“We need to put this money to work for working families,” Gov. Phil Scott said during his annual budget address in early 2022, about using federal stimulus funds to help plug Vermont’s housing deficit. “They’re depending on us, and with some creativity, and these historic resources, we can make this happen.”
There has been no comprehensive accounting of how much money the state poured into building housing in the first half of the decade, and how many homes it helped create.
VTDigger/Vermont Public gathered data on housing spending from the three major entities who oversee public funding for housing development in the state: the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board and the Agency of Commerce and Community Development.
An analysis by the news organizations found that between 2020 and 2024, the state directed over $789 million of public funds toward building new apartments and homes for sale, and rehabilitating housing that had fallen into disrepair. That dollar figure includes money from state and federal sources, and encompasses programs new and old — including state initiatives begun in the months after the pandemic hit, and federal financing streams like tax credits that have been available for decades.
That total does not include funding spent on homeless shelters and upgrades to manufactured home communities, nor does it include funds overseen by municipalities. It also excludes funding specific to flood recovery efforts. (Read more about our methodology here.)
The influx of public money has helped create 2,249 new homes. Another 1,156 units were rehabilitated — a catchall term that includes everything from creating new apartments in an old school to preserving an existing complex as subsidized housing. Additionally, a new initiative aimed at renovating vacant apartments that had fallen into disrepair and building accessory dwelling units in homeowners’ backyards helped create 1,015 homes. 
Generally speaking, housing projects need an affordability requirement to receive public funding, so the vast majority of these homes include some kind of income-restriction or cost cap for potential tenants and buyers. Some are still in the development pipeline and have not yet opened their doors.
 
‘Not enough yet’
Looked at one way, the windfall of federal funds helped kick the state’s affordable housing builders into “hyperdrive,” said Alex Farrell, commissioner of the Department of Housing and Community Development, who helped guide spending decisions after he began his tenure with the state as deputy commissioner in 2021. 
Building permits have trended upward over the last five years for all types of housing, and the influx of funds helped shore up the low- and moderate-income end of the market during a particularly vulnerable moment, Farrell noted.

Looked at another way, though, the skyrocketing cost of building during this timeframe meant Vermont got far less bang for its buck than it would have in a pre-pandemic economy. 
Couple that fact with the lengthy process involved in cobbling together funding sources for large-scale projects — along with lengthy government approvals, construction delays and legal challenges launched by neighbors in some cases — and it’s clear that the state has still yet to see the full impact of this windfall. 
 
According to data provided by the Vermont Housing Finance Agency from its directory of affordable rentals, 866 new apartments opened up to potential tenants between 2020 and 2024. That’s only a modest jump from 696 new rentals first occupied in the previous five-year period, before Covid – highlighting just how long it takes for many larger-scale affordable housing developments to come online.
“So far, our inventory of all the affordable housing in the state doesn’t yet show the big increase in homes that has resulted from this massive infusion of money,” said Maura Collins, executive director of the Vermont Housing Finance Agency.

And publicly-subsidized affordable housing only makes up a modest fraction of the overall market. Against the backdrop of the state’s severe housing shortage, the boost in funding during the Covid years did not prove enough on its own to correct course. About 2,400 building permits for all residences – not just affordable housing – were issued annually between 2020 and 2024. But recent assessments show the state must double or triple that pace to get the housing market to a healthy state. Meanwhile, homelessness remains at record levels.
For the people who gained an affordable place to live because of the state’s massive investment in home construction, the funding made a world of difference, said Gus Seelig, executive director of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board.
But “if you look at it from the way the housing market has changed, you’d say: ‘Not enough yet,’” he said.
New neighborhoods
As this money began flowing into the state, developers began charting out some of the biggest affordable housing projects in Vermont in recent memory. On the large end of that scale: entirely new neighborhoods. 
One such development is tucked behind a mattress store and a Nepalese restaurant in Shelburne, once home to an Econo Lodge motel. The nonprofit developer Champlain Housing Trust purchased the property more than a decade ago to operate it as emergency housing for people experiencing homelessness, but the trust’s leaders had long dreamed of redeveloping the five and a half acres off of Route 7 into something more.

That transformation is now nearly complete. One morning in early August, construction workers buzzed around the property, putting the finishing touches on 68 income-restricted apartments which will stay affordable in perpetuity. 
Some homeowners had already moved into more than two dozen brand-new, shared-equity condominiums, their potted plants lining balconies overlooking a freshly-paved road. Those condos are selling for under $190,000 each. Their market values are estimated at more than twice that amount — around $485,000 for a three-bedroom, according to the trust’s website.

Michael Monte, the trust’s CEO, took in the scene. “When you see people beginning to own their own homes and are just so happy when they move in, or when people move into their rental housing and finally have stable housing…” He paused as a power tool roared. “Big difference.” 
This Shelburne project, called Bay Ridge, is among the largest recipients of the state’s Covid-era windfall. 
 
Publicly-subsidized affordable housing projects typically bring in funding from a wide array of sources, and Bay Ridge is no exception: a funding source breakdown provided by Monte includes 25 different budget lines. A few of the biggest streams of funding for the project stemmed from the pandemic-era funding push, including more than $10 million of federal stimulus funding for the rentals, along with a $4.8 million from a Covid-era program dedicated to building middle-income homes for purchase. The single largest funding source was over $14 million in private equity from federal tax credits.
The total price tag for the project came to about $55 million, for both the rental and homeownership portions. That means it cost about $584,000 on average to build each of the 94 total homes. That’s not a far leap from the average per-unit development cost of new affordable rentals last year, which was over $500,000.
“It’s sometimes shocking to me to look at the dollar amounts that we’re talking about,” said Collins, from the Vermont Housing Finance Agency.

Collins often thinks about the number of homes Vermont could have built with this money under pre-Covid economic conditions. But high interest rates and a rapid rise in construction costs in the pandemic years dampened how far the funding could go. According to a 2019 VHFA report, the median per-unit development cost of affordable rental housing in Vermont between 2009 and 2018 was about $228,000.
“It has been daunting to watch the amount of money going out the door, creating not as many homes as [it] would have been five years ago,” Collins said.
Those factors have hampered building throughout the entire housing market. Yet building affordable housing with public funds has its own distinct cost-drivers.
When developers piece together state and federal funding sources, they must then comply with a thicket of state and federal rules. Some federal funds in recent years came with requirements to source materials inside U.S. borders, a rule that has proved onerous for many affordable housing developers. Within Vermont, developers might seek to make a building highly energy efficient to get priority access to funding, or build in a downtown location that might have toxic soils that need to be cleaned up, or need to set aside a share of units for people exiting homelessness and provide services for those tenants.
“When we say we’re building affordable housing, we’re doing so much more than that,” Collins said. “But…when public money comes with too many rules and regulations, then we need to look at if there are quicker, easier, better ways — so that we’re not inadvertently adding to the cost of housing through the way we do things.”

‘A lot of units at a very low cost’
At the opposite end of the spectrum, state officials also used Covid stimulus funds to dole out relatively modest grants for small-scale housing projects, like helping homeowners build accessory dwelling units and rehabilitating apartments that had fallen into disrepair.
The state’s main vehicle for these types of projects is the Vermont Housing Improvement Program, or VHIP, which launched in 2020. VHIP continues to provide funds to landlords and developers to fix up existing vacant rentals that need repairs in order to meet safety codes, add new units onto existing buildings and construct small apartment buildings.  
Between 2020 and 2024, the state spent $38.7 million on VHIP grants and loans, which helped produce 1,015 homes. The average grant is $38,000, according to state data. Property owners have to match at least 20% of the funds they get with their own money.
“What’s exciting about VHIP is it delivers a lot of units at a very low cost,” said Farrell, the housing commissioner.
David Begin stumbled upon the VHIP program when catching up on the news in 2020. A master plumber with a family rental business in Canaan, a town of fewer than 1,000 residents in Vermont’s far northeastern corner, Begin decided to apply for a grant. He received $30,000 to rehab an abandoned duplex, he said.
“There’s a family of four kids and mom and pop living in it. Been there for five years,” he said. The four-bedroom apartment rents for $950 a month.

VHIP has a different philosophy than most large-scale affordable housing developments in Vermont. Rather than require that the homes stay affordable permanently, VHIP’s original iteration stipulated that the rentals remain under the federal government’s “fair market rent” standard for five years. (The current version of the program has a 10-year loan option.) The program also mandated that funding recipients prioritize vulnerable tenants, like people exiting homelessness and refugees.
As the rules start to lift this year, some landlords will face a choice: keep renting to their current tenants at below-market rates, or raise prices and threaten eviction.
According to data provided by the Department of Housing and Community Development, 68 homes will hit the end of their affordability-compliance period in 2025. Another 157 will hit that cliff next year.
 
Farrell, the housing commissioner, said initial conversations have led him to believe many landlords intend to keep renting at below-market rates.
Begin is one of them. 
“We got good tenants…and we’re happy with what we’re doing,” he said. He was pleased enough with his first VHIP experience that he went on to get a second grant to work on three apartments in an old post office building in town. “I don’t do that Airbnb thing. I’m more – take care of the local people,” he said.

A blip?
For now, groundbreakings and ribbon cuttings for affordable housing projects that received Covid-era funds keep getting announced. But in the near future, as the federal dollars get used up, many housing leaders expect those celebrations to wind down.
“We’re going to see, two years from now, production of new units really fall off — unless, as a state, we make a choice that we’re going to figure out how to raise revenue,” said Seelig, from the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board.
The Democrat-controlled Legislature, which holds Vermont’s purse-strings, has yet to make that choice. In 2024, a bill that would have created new taxes on higher-earners to fund affordable housing production passed the House but died in the Senate. Lawmakers did not consider a similar proposal this past session. Some affordable housing boosters, like Monte from Champlain Housing Trust, hope legislators will take up the idea again in 2026. The prospect of success appears dim, though, as tax-averse Republicans have gained more traction in the Statehouse with the backing of Scott, a Republican.
 
That political dynamic leaves Vermont leaders with less funding to pour into affordable housing as federal support for housing and homelessness is threatened under the Trump administration – and as Vermont’s need for more homes remains stark.

As the Covid-era stimulus funds have run dry, lawmakers and the governor have enacted other policies to try and tamp down housing costs and spur more building, from land use reforms to financing tools aimed at boosting the infrastructure needed for new construction. 
In an executive order aimed at boosting more homebuilding issued this week, Scott noted that despite the “unprecedented, focused commitment of state resources” during the pandemic years, Vermont still has a deep housing deficit – which, he argued, “can only be addressed through more private investment, and substantial regulatory reform.”
Collins, from the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, sees plenty more room to streamline the homebuilding process. Vermont must flood the overall market with homes to regulate supply and demand, she noted. 
“But if there’s not funding…then I’m worried that while we’ll be helping all housing, we may run the risk of having affordable housing – and housing for the lowest-income Vermonters – fall short,” she said.
If Vermont strays from its focus on the housing issue, she said, the Covid-era boost in building affordable homes will be nothing but a blip.
Methodology
VTDigger and Vermont Public gathered data on housing spending from the three main agencies that oversee housing funds in the state: the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board and the Agency of Commerce and Community Development.
We looked at funds spent on housing development between 2020 and 2024. Our dataset includes funding that flowed through the three agencies from federal Covid-era stimulus packages like the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. It also includes state General Fund surplus funding – because it was the result of additional federal aid statewide – as well as regular state and federal financing streams for housing spent during this timeframe.
Our goal was to look at new units added to Vermont’s housing stock with these funds. That was not always possible based on how the agencies reported whether units were “new” or “rehabbed.” In inter-agency datasets provided to us by VHFA and VHCB, for example, “rehab” is a broad term that includes both existing affordable housing projects getting renovations to increase longevity, as well as older buildings getting turned into apartments for the first time. We opted to include this broader category of “rehab” units in our analysis in order to capture a fuller picture of new homes added to Vermont’s housing stock, and because removing them from the datasets would have required project-by-project research.
Apartments rehabilitated through the VHIP program need to be vacant by definition, with the repair money going toward bringing the unit back up to health code standards. (In a small number of cases, grants have been awarded to occupied rentals for urgent health upgrades; in those instances, property owners were required to house tenants elsewhere while renovations took place.) Therefore, these are effectively apartments reentering Vermont’s housing stock – so we included them in our analysis.
We opted to exclude certain kinds of rehab projects that did not straightforwardly add homes to Vermont’s housing stock, including funding for homeowner health and safety repairs and infrastructure work at manufactured home communities. We also excluded funding for housing projects that serve hyper-specific subpopulations, including farmworkers and people with intellectual and development disabilities. We excluded shelters for people experiencing homelessness.
We thoroughly reviewed the data sources to remove duplicate projects between different agencies and different years. We also fact-checked our methodology with each agency to ensure accuracy.
Regardless, with any data project there are some caveats. To arrive at the total amount of funding, we combined different programs that utilized a combination of tax credits, loans and grants, meaning that when and how money was outlayed could vary from project to project. While we researched many projects in the course of our reporting, we did not fact-check the details of every project with its individual developers. 
We also included two additional data sources in the story to help contextualize the Covid-era funding figures. One is the Vermont Housing Finance Agency’s online database of affordable rentals, which allowed us to look at the overall construction of affordable rental housing before and after the start of the pandemic. The other was the U.S. Census Bureau’s survey of building permits, which captured new construction of both affordable housing and market-rate housing in Vermont.

(Stock photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)A bipartisan pair of Ohio Senators are working to rebuild a housing safety net program aimed at lower income seniors and disabled Ohioans.
The Ohio Housing Finance Agency’s Save The Dream program started during the COVID-19 pandemic, and gave eligible homeowners help with mortgage payments, utility bills, and property taxes.
State Sens. Hearcel Craig, D-Columbus, and Michele Reynolds, R-Canal Winchester, want to restart that program by authorizing the agency to spend up to $10 million in homeowner assistance grants.
Save The Dream
In 2022, the Ohio Housing Finance Agency launched Save The Dream with $280 million in federal funds. The idea was to reduce foreclosures and utility shut-offs brought on by financial hardship tied to the pandemic.
Applicants had to fall below an income threshold — about $100,000 for an individual or just shy of $148,000 for a family of four — and the program capped assistance at $25,000.

According to Ohio Housing Finance Agency reporting, that program wound up spending $260 million of its total appropriation and helped almost 35,000 households.
The lion’s share of that funding, more than $213 million of the total, went to mortgage assistance. It handed out another $27 million to help cover property taxes and about $15 million in utility assistance.
Although it set a relatively generous income cut off of 150% of the area median income, the vast majority of recipients made far less than that.
More than 60% of the households who received assistance reported incomes at or below 50% of the area median income.
The housing finance agency Public Affairs Director Penny Martin said they heard from people “regularly” about how helpful the program was.
“It helped them kind of, I’m going to use the term rebound, from the impacts of the pandemic,” she said. “We still do get calls every now and then asking if the program’s going, if the program is still available.”
The state proposal
The program Sens. Craig and Reynolds envision takes the federally funded program as a model, but it’s dramatically smaller.
Instead of the Department of the Treasury authorizing $280 million, the senators are talking about $10 million. And with that smaller nest egg, eligibility is narrower, and the support available is smaller.
Under Craig and Reynolds’ Ohio Senate Bill 255, homeowners would need less than 75,000 in income to qualify. They’d also need to a senior, disabled, or the caretaker of someone who’s disabled.
Like the federal program, S.B. 255 caps the total amount of assistance a homeowner can receive. Instead of the $25,000 ceiling under the original program, the state plan caps assistance at $3,000.
Still, Craig contends the proposal will deliver important assistance even if it does so on a smaller scale. A missed mortgage payment or utility bill, “can quickly spiral into foreclosure or loss of basic needs,” he said.
“The need is there,” he added, “as you look across the landscape in Ohio.”
Ohio electric bills likely to keep going up after latest PJM auction

For many Ohioans, the financial strain from the pandemic never really went away.
Some have had to find multiple gigs to make up the one job they lost. The inflation rate is no longer flirting with double digits, but costs haven’t gone back to pre-pandemic levels.
Meanwhile, Ohioans are seeing higher utility costs and property tax bills.
Craig thinks a new Save the Dream program could help lighten the load.
“We believe that there’s lots of integrity in the process,” he said. “And it certainly is a process that is needed, and even more valuable now, since you know, things have grown exponentially with regard to access to affordable housing (and) keeping seniors in their homes, certainly. And so, we believe that it has great merit and it’s a process that certainly needs to continue.”
It seems some other policymakers are considering the same issue. City leaders in Columbus, for instance, are rolling out a rental assistance program to soften the impact as a federal rent program expires.

To qualify, a Columbus State graduate must be an Ohio resident, file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid annually, be a full-time Ohio State student, and have a family adjusted gross income of $100,000 or less. 
Buckeye Bridge will cover all tuition and mandatory fees for up to eight semesters at Ohio State. 
“It’s about eliminating uncertainty for students and families,” Columbus State President David Harrison said. “It’s about creating a clear, predictable, guaranteed, debt-free pathway.”
More than 1,000 students per year transfer from Columbus State to Ohio State. 
“This effort will strengthen the associates to bachelor’s pipeline for central Ohioans, creating new pathways for students, further their education, and earn the skills necessary for many of our state’s in-demand jobs,” Ohio State University President Ted Carter said.  
This initiative is about access and opportunity for Ohio students, he said. 
“Every student who’s willing to work hard should have the opportunity to pursue a four-year degree no matter their background,” Carter said. “Programs like Buckeye Bridge send a message to our young people that we want you here, and we’re working hard to reduce barriers to a college education.” 
This will also benefit Ohio’s economy, he said. 
“More Ohio students will have the opportunity to earn their bachelor’s degree, building a strong pipeline of talent for Ohio employers and meeting the need for more highly skilled graduates to fill in demand jobs across our state,” Carter said. 
Imanie Williams, a computer information systems student at Columbus State, will be graduating with her associates degree in the spring and plans to transfer to Ohio State to earn her bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. 
“From a young age, I faced obstacles that could have discouraged me — from losing my sense of home to navigating my 20’s as a caretaker for my grandmother, all working long hours,” said Williams, who was born and raised in Columbus. “Becoming a first-generation student has been a battle, but has built my resilience and strengthened my determination.”
Columbus State helped make her dream of going to college a reality and she is excited to be part of Buckeye Bridge next fall. 
“It shows Ohio State not only believes in hard working students, but is also committed to making sure students like me have the resources we need to succeed even after we transfer,” she said. “This support removes the many barriers I faced and allows me to fully focus on my studies, building my career, and to be able to give back to the community that has raised me.”
More than 60 companies have recently moved or expanded into Ohio, Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel said. 
“There are going to be so many opportunities for our Ohioans to reach their God-given potential,” he said. “This is going to be a great message for the rest of the state that let’s find ways to get together, because we have the greatest opportunities we may have ever had in the history of our state.”

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The largest educator unions across Ohio have filed a lawsuit against the state for removing their voices from the retired teachers’ pension fund.
On Tuesday, the Ohio Education Association (OEA), the Ohio Federation of Teachers (OFT), and the Ohio Conference of the American Association of University Professors (OC AAUP) sued the state, arguing the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board changes are “unconstitutional and discriminatory,” according to a press release.
“This policy is the latest in a long line of attacks against educators in Ohio,” said Glenetta Krause of Cincinnati Public Schools in the press release. “Statehouse politicians have underfunded our public schools, rolled back our collective bargaining rights, fully eliminated Ohio’s elected State Board of Education, and told us what we can and can’t teach. Now they’re taking away our representation on our own retirement board. This lawsuit is about restoring fairness and protecting our fundamental right to have a say in how our retirement is managed.”
A last-minute provision in the state budget changed the makeup of the board from seven elected teachers — five contributing and two retired — to three elected, after seats are phased out over several years.
Two of the educator seats will be for active educators, and only one retiree seat will be available.
Under the current statute, signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine, those four removed educator seats will be filled with newly appointed members.
Right now, the governor gets to appoint one investment expert. The Speaker of the House and the Senate President jointly appoint an expert. The treasurer gets an appointee, and so does the director of the Department of Education and Workforce.
Eventually, the treasurer will get two appointees, the legislative leaders will get one each and one combined, equalling three.
The chancellor of the Department of Higher Education will get one, and the governor and the Department of Education and Workforce each get one.
The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates educators’ right to equal protection under the law because only STRS was changed, not the other four Ohio public employee pension funds.
The educators also take issue with the manner in which the provision was passed, without having it be considered on at least three different days, and that it was included in legislation that was more than one subject. The budget, which was thousands of pages, covered everything from tax policy to STRS to LGBTQ+ rights.
Lawmakers made the decision due to the past year of controversy, they said.
“We stand by the law that was passed and look forward to the law being upheld in court,” state Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, said Tuesday. “We believe the change was needed to provide stable governance to protect the pensions for hardworking teachers, current retirees, and future retirees.”
Bird was the one who drafted the provision. House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, was among those unhappy with how the pension fund has been run.
“I think there’s been pretty widespread concern about some of the management of the state teachers’ retirement system,” Stewart said during the budget process.
WEWS’s extensive reporting was cited in the press release.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both public corruption schemes and the mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
A 14-page whistleblower memo given to DeWine in May alleged a massive public corruption scandal brewing and moving quickly within STRS.
Attorney General Dave Yost soon after filed a lawsuit to remove former members Wade Steen and Rudy Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract-steering “scheme” that could directly benefit them.
The lawsuit accuses the pair of “colluding” with investment startup QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel, to secure a contract giving them 70% of the STRS assets — about $65 billion at the time. The memo accuses QED of helping to elect board members who may be more sympathetic to their proposal.
Steen and Fichtenbaum have continued to maintain their innocence, arguing that Yost and DeWine are part of a “political scheme” to prevent educators who want more transparency and to change the investment structure. The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.”
This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund.
Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
Steen and Metcalf, the men with the relationship at the center of the conversation, also spoke with me in response to the governor’s comments in their own Q&A that can be found here.

(Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)I recently emailed Kansas’ senior senator, Jerry Moran, to ask about life in Washington, D.C.: “How does it feel to live in an occupied city?”
As President Donald Trump moves the country ever closer to a full-fledged autocracy, I wrote: “I wish I could say that I was surprised you have, as far as I can tell, said nothing. But I’m not. In fact, at this point, I would be surprised if you raised your voice (or even said NO with your Senate vote) in any meaningful way. It is past time to stand up and demand some real ‘Kansas Common Sense’ in the spirit of Thomas Paine’s clarion call for ‘Common Sense’ of 1776. If Trump’s cruel takeover of America is not stopped, what will be left to celebrate on the country’s 250th?”
Fifty years ago, as our country readied itself for the bicentennial, this was not the case. At that time, Kansas still had Republican leaders capable of independent thought and action, and our senior senator, James B. Pearson, was one.
Pearson (1920-2009) moved to Johnson County after service in World War II. He engaged with Republican Party politics, served a term in the state senate, and identified with the party’s moderate or progressive wing. After U.S. Sen. Andrew Schoeppel died in January 1962, Pearson’s friend and political ally, Gov. John Anderson, appointed him to the vacant seat to which he was reelected twice (1962-1978).
Pearson became known and respected for bipartisan legislating and a willingness to challenge his party’s administration when he thought it was wrong: Vietnam, nuclear weapons policy, judicial and cabinet nominations, and so on. This did not stop in the wake of the Watergate scandal that took down his party’s president.
Pearson was a prominent minority party member of the Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency (later the Special Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers) chaired by his friend and frequent collaborator, Sen. Frank Church, an Idaho Democrat. The committee conducted an investigation and held hearings in 1973 and 1974, and it introduced “A bill to terminate certain authorities with respect to national emergencies still in effect, and to provide for the orderly implementation and termination of future national emergencies.”
The National Emergencies Act passed the Senate in October 1974 but did not become law until amended in the House, accepted by the Senate, and signed by President Gerald Ford on Sept. 14, 1976. Although admittedly imperfect from the outset, the NEA should be used to reign in the Trump administration before it moves into more “blue cities” across America.
Pearson made his case for reform in this area via an editorial published in the Wichita Eagle and Beacon on Aug. 18, 1974, just nine days after Richard Nixon resigned rather than face almost certain impeachment, conviction, and removal from office.
“To say that a contemporary president would not likely abuse emergency power available to him is no guarantee that some future president under unforeseen conditions might not do so,” Pearson wrote.
Even when done with best of intentions (and clearly this is not Trump), executive orders and the application of emergency powers are a convenient way for the president to make “decisions which should be properly shared with the Congress. … If we are to maintain a proper balance of power over the long haul,” warned the senator, “we must continually be on the alert to prevent the unnecessary exercise of presidential power and the undesirable decline of congressional authority.”
And, I would add, an erosion in the rule of law.
Unfortunately, it does not appear that Moran, who really does seem care about the state and its people at one level, will rise to the occasion and take on the role of statesman, not the mere partisan. Kansas once had members of Congress who understood that abuse of power can come from within one’s own party and acted against it. I am hoping against hope, however, that Moran will follow Pearson’s example and do the right thing at this perilous juncture in our nation’s history.
As Paine wrote in 1776: “I’ll tell you friend … in America THE LAW IS KING. … In free countries the law ought to be King; and there ought to be no other.”

(Courtesy of the Buffett Early Childhood Institute) In early 2025, Step Up to Quality, the Nebraska Department of Education’s voluntary quality-improvement program for early child care providers, reached an exciting milestone: More than 1,000 providers now participate in our program.
This is an important achievement, not only for our expanding community of providers, but also for elevating the caliber of early childhood education in Nebraska. Since launching our program in 2014, nearly 54,000 children in the state have benefitted from enriched learning environments.
Step Up to Quality helps great child care providers become even better through a five-step program that provides specialized training, access to professional coaches and financial incentives. The program also helps parents find high-quality care in their area.
Early childhood is one of the most important times in a person’s life. High-quality early child care and education are crucial to a child’s future success, with 90% of brain development occurring before age 5. Early learning builds the foundation for skills needed in school, work and life.
Children who receive quality early child care and education are more likely to show improved reading and math skills, graduate high school, attend college, have a job and earn higher wages.
In Nebraska, there’s a pressing need for high-quality early child care and education. As of March 2025, 10 of Nebraska’s 93 counties reported no child care providers, according to an analysis by the Buffett Early Childhood Institute. As of 2023, nearly 111,000 Nebraska children under the age of 6 needed child care, according to the 2024 Kids Count in Nebraska Report, the state’s most comprehensive resource on child well-being.

This shortage has a direct impact on Nebraska’s economy. The Kids Count report noted that 74.6% of children under age 6 had all available parents in the workforce in 2023. But when parents don’t have access to care, they can’t work. Estimates show Nebraska loses nearly $745 million a year due to inadequate childcare access, and nearly $1.4  billion a year when factoring multiplier effects across the broader economy, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Bureau of Business Research.
At Step Up to Quality, we’re working to bridge this gap. Our community of rated providers currently operate in 86% of Nebraska counties, a number that has grown significantly since the program started in 2014. We’re proud that so many early childhood educators are stepping up and making the effort to improve the care they provide through Step Up to Quality.
When we invest time and other resources into early childhood education, everyone benefits. Investment in early childhood education returns over $7 for every dollar invested, particularly when reaching disadvantaged families, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. These investments reduce remedial education costs, increase high school graduation rates and increase earnings and tax revenue.
When we invest in our young people, we invest in the health and well being of our entire state.
By joining Step Up to Quality, participating child care providers commit to defining and elevating quality for Nebraska’s children. They exceed licensing requirements by attending extra training, analyzing their business operations, updating their educational offerings to match best practices and continuously improving the quality of the care they provide. The 1,036 Nebraska child care programs participating in Step Up to Quality (as of June 2025) include child cares in homes, centers, Head Start and public school preschools and private preschools.
At Step Up to Quality, we are committed to continual improvement ourselves. We recently redesigned our website, stepuptoquality.ne.gov, adding a search function, consolidating parent and provider resources and partnering with an accessibility consultant to ensure the new site is as accessible as possible, including color contrast, image descriptions and short summaries at the bottoms of main pages.
In addition to joining a community of supportive, like-minded professionals in early childhood education, Step Up to Quality offers advantages to participating child care providers. Since the program began in 2014, 4,820 people have completed our orientation, 361 programs have received free guidance from a professional coach and more than $542,000 has been awarded in incentive bonuses for quality.
These incentives are designed to support existing providers and encourage new providers to enhance the quality of their care, ensuring our children receive the building blocks they need for a bright future.
Lauri Cimino is the director of Step Up to Quality. She has served in early childhood education roles in public schools, nonprofits, federal government programs and privately run child development centers.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)The Maine Legislature has debated how aggressive the state should be in protecting consumer privacy online for the past several years. But competing proposals — along with sizable behind-the-scenes influence from lobbyists — have left the state still without a comprehensive data privacy law.
When lawmakers return in January, the issue will again be in play. However, this time, they will have insight into how the more stringent version of such law actually works in practice.
Deviating from the more than a dozen states that have adopted a model favored by industry groups, Maryland passed a version that places stricter standards on what data companies can collect or sell, similar to the proposal in Maine that has been favored by the majority of the Judiciary Committee. That law will take effect on Oct. 1.
In an interview with Maine Morning Star, Maryland Sen. Sara Love (D-Montgomery), one of the lead sponsors of the soon-to-be law, said it took several years and intentional countering of a sizable lobbying effort to get it passed. Quoting Maine Morning Star’s 2024 article on lobbying in Maine and across the country, Love said it was like “death by a thousand cuts” with trade organization lobbyists backed by Big Tech asking for more and more amendments.
“A legislator wants to work with groups and compromise with them, but all of a sudden you realize, if you do that, you have nothing — you have a bill that is not worth the paper it’s written on,” Love said. “So we decided ahead of time, what are the most important things to us? Where can we compromise, and where are we drawing the line?”
What ultimately got the bill over the finish line, Love said, was supportive committee chairs and “I think for us, the tech community overplayed their hand.” Another effort to undermine the Maryland law was attempted this year with a bill that Google explicitly supported, though it failed.
In Maine, there is still steep opposition from some lawmakers and local businesses to the proposal most similar to Maryland’s law. Some of the resistance is similar to that seen in Maryland, including concerns about untested language, but an uncertain economic landscape is now also part of the picture, including impact from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
‘Death by a thousand cuts’: A look at Big Tech’s efforts to influence data privacy

The proposals in Maine
Lawmakers started 2025 with three separate proposals.
The one favored by the Judiciary Committee was carried over into next year and, despite not actually making it to a vote in the Maine Senate or House of Representatives, it drew the most lobbying spending. This bill, LD 1822 sponsored by Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), would make Maine have some of the strictest consumer protections in the country.
The committee nixed a competing plan that was the favorite of business interests, LD 1224 sponsored by Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick), unanimously voting it down in an attempt to limit the number of proposals considered by the full Legislature.
A similar plan, LD 1088 sponsored by Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford), did make it to the floor but died upon adjournment after the House rejected it. But Henderson plans to propose her version again as an amendment to LD 1822 next year.
Disagreement over what the fundamental framework of such a law should be remains.
Kuhn’s bill relies on a data minimization standard, which broadly means limiting the collection of personal information to only what is necessary to fulfill the consumer service. This is the standard Maryland’s law uses.
The version businesses favor uses what’s referred to as an opt-in model, allowing companies to collect data as long as consumers agree to it.
“The whole point of a data privacy law is to reduce the amount of data overall that is collected about us, and this, in fact, would do that,” Kuhn said of her proposal.
Whereas Henderson said, “I know for sure that it does not go too far,” referring to her proposal’s regulations on businesses, “and that isn’t something I can say for LD 1822.”
Roberts did not respond to Maine Morning Star’s request for comment.
How will the proposals impact small businesses?
In both 2024 and 2025, a key point of pushback from businesses to the stricter proposal was that it would limit their ability to do targeted advertising, a tactic opponents say is disproportionately relied on by small businesses with limited marketing dollars.

Kuhn built her bill off of one considered in the 131st Legislature and said she met with small businesses to try to address remaining concerns before the 132nd Legislature began.
She preserved exemptions that had already been negotiated, including for entire companies whose data collection is already regulated by federal laws. She also made a handful of tweaks based on feedback from businesses.
Notably, she eliminated data identifying an individual’s “online activities over time and across 3rd party websites or online services” from the definition of sensitive data, which would have reduced the ability to track cookies.
“It is critically important that Maine small businesses have access to these digital marketing tools,” Kuhn said. “That question is not in dispute.”
However, business interests are not satisfied.
Targeted advertising
Kuhn’s proposal wouldn’t restrict a business’ ability to do targeted advertising to existing customers, Curtis Picard, CEO of the Retail Association of Maine, which testified against LD 1822, told Maine Morning Star.
But Picard said it would place limits on how they can target new customers — a claim that Kuhn argues is false.
Picard gave the example of someone coming across an ad on social media that they engage with and then after the company pushes an ad or an email giving that person a discount on their first purchase.
“This is an example of a commonly stated generic concern — ‘businesses won’t be able to reach future customers’ — that has been frequently made without any substantiation,” Kuhn said.
Kuhn pointed out that, in that scenario, if a consumer is presented with an ad on social media and then clicks on the link, the consumer has requested a product or service — in this case, access to the website — and received it. Therefore, she said, cookies can be attached and subsequent ads are permitted.
Kuhn’s proposal sets two thresholds for data collection.
It would restrict the collection of personal data (information that can be reasonably linked to a consumer) to only what’s “reasonably necessary and proportionate” to provide the service requested by a consumer. It would also restrict the collection of sensitive data (such as race, citizenship, genetic and other information as defined in the bill) to only what’s “strictly necessary” in that scenario, and outright ban such information from being sold.
Appeals court rules provision of digital ad tax violates First Amendment protections

“A lot of well meaning small businesses are saying it’s going to hurt them but they can’t articulate how,” Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), a co-sponsor of Kuhn’s bill who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, told Maine Morning Star. “The only answer we’re getting back is uncertainty, which is, in Augusta speak, we don’t actually have any policy concerns with the bill anymore.”
At a work session on May 23, Kuhn asked Stacy Stitham, managing partner at Brann & Isaacson who was working on behalf of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, “Where in the bill is there a barrier to reaching a new customer?”
Stitham responded, “You have to go back to basically the first sentence of the statute which limits the collection of data to what’s reasonably necessary and proportionate to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the consumer,” which is the data minimization standard.
This mirrors the Maryland law. Stitham added, “As we know, the Maryland law is not in effect yet. We don’t know how that’s being interpreted, but it’s much different than the standard that’s used by other states which talk about disclosed purposes.”
During the final work session for the bill this year on May 30, ​​Maine Assistant Attorney General Brendan O’Neil from the consumer protection office said, “I don’t see a restriction on targeted advertising in the bill.”
There is currently a patchwork of state laws and parts of federal legislation governing internet privacy, as there remains no one overarching federal law, despite several proposals. Connecticut was the fifth state to enact an omnibus privacy law in 2022 but its version, the one favored by industry groups, has been the model adopted by most states that followed.
In the work session, O’Neil pointed to the Connecticut’s attorney general’s recommendation for its state Legislature to amend the law to strengthen data minimization provisions rather than rely on its current “exploitable” consent model.
Reading from the officer’s report, O’Neil summarized, “‘serious privacy and data security concerns could have been offset, if not fully alleviated, if companies had properly minimized the data they collected and maintained.’ That’s really what LD 1822’s data minimization standard aims to do.”
Connecticut tweaked its law in several ways this spring, but did not ultimately adopt the data minimization standard as seen in Kuhn’s proposal and the Maryland law.
Consumer consent
On May 29, a coalition of business groups including the Maine State Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee outlining their major concerns, notably the data minimization standard.
But the letter also took issue with the sensitive data restrictions — which mirror those in Maryland’s law — arguing instead that data use should be tied to consumer consent, not based on data type.

This was another common argument brought up by those who favored Henderson’s version.
“They want to completely remove consent so that a consumer can’t even consent to have their information used to get discounts or to be marketed to and I want to keep that consent piece,” Henderson said.
Stitham, representing the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, made a similar point this spring.
“While clearly intended to be more consumer protective,” Stitham said, “by shifting the focus from consumer consent to disclosed purposes to whatever the business can characterize as needed to provide or maintain a requested product or service, the bill actually eliminates consumer choice and control, and potentially leaves room for businesses to justify broad data collection practices without the consumer’s clear, informed consent.”
Kuhn and lawmakers who favor her proposal said this argument rests on a false contention that Maine consumers engage in informed and voluntary consent now.
Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) said Henderson’s bill “was essentially preserving the status quo with regard to the protections that consumers currently have in the absence of any data privacy law.”
It would take the average person more than 40 hours per month to read the privacy policies that an American consumer typically encounters each month, according to testimony given to the committee and affirmed by recent studies.
Kuhn gave the example of health tracker apps that require consumer consent to the terms and conditions in order to use the product when saying, “That’s not voluntary consent. It’s a mandatory threshold.”
Henderson drew a distinction between lengthy terms and conditions and what would be required in her bill. “It has to be clear, conspicuous, bold,” she said of the privacy notice allowing consumers to opt out of having their data sold or used in marketing.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When asked to comment on their latest stance on Kuhn’s bill, L.L. Bean deferred to the company’s testimony, in which legal counsel Christy van Voorhees argued LD 1822’s data minimization standard effectively bans the vast majority of personalized, targeted advertising.
This testimony echoed that of many businesses, but also underscored that the current political landscape is another key factor.
“These restrictions are being proposed at a historically challenging time for Maine retailers,” van Voorhees said. “The ongoing retreat of Canadian customers from U.S. businesses, coupled with the increased costs associated with new universal and threatened reciprocal tariffs, is squeezing marketing budgets. That means that the marketing investments we do make have to be efficient. Personalized, targeted ads are among our most efficient marketing investments.”
Concern of economic uncertainty — which was also raised by industry associations such as HospitalityMaine and individual businesses like Union River Lobster Pot restaurant — makes Kuhn believe the decision to carry over her bill to the next session was the best choice, as well as opportune timing with the start of Maryland’s law.
With an effective date of Oct. 1, Maryland’s law will provide three months of results by the time the Maine Legislature returns in January, though there is also a cure period, giving entities 60 days to adhere after a notice of violation from the Maryland Attorney General on or before April 1, 2027.
“We’ll be able to see, what impact did this phrasing, this language, have on small businesses in Maryland?” Kuhn said. “Were they able to continue to draw ads just as they can now?”
As Maine has considered a data privacy law, businesses have stressed the importance of interoperability between states.
“I’m getting tired of Maine being this petri dish for national groups trying to get first-in-the-nation type of legislation,” said Picard, of the retail association. “I do think Representative Kuhn was trying to make it work, but ultimately it ends up being convoluted and complex language that has been untested.”
Now, Kuhn and supporters of her proposal say Maryland’s law will provide that test, affording a preview of how passing such a law would go in Maine.
But others say it’ll be too soon to tell.
“You’re not going to see the sky fall in a few months,” Henderson said.
Kuhn and Henderson said if either version of a data privacy law is finally passed next session, continuous adjustments will still be needed. Both of their bills would require annual reviews by the state attorney general, similar to those required in other states.
Currently, LD 1822, Kuhn’s bill that was carried over, is still in possession of the Maine House. It’s unclear whether the body will recommit it to committee or take action on the floor when lawmakers return.
Other than shifting the implementation date back, Kuhn doesn’t plan to amend her proposal, but she said she’s leaving the possibility open if any glaring need for changes become apparent once Maryland’s law is in effect.
There is also a concept draft, LD 595 sponsored by Carney, being carried over into next year. It currently reads that it could “further update certain consumer privacy laws in response to recent developments in federal and state consumer privacy laws.”
Carney said she originally filed the placeholder bill not knowing what the changes would be made to Connecticut’s law or possible federal law. The legislation will now serve a similar purpose next year as a way for the Judiciary Committee to address the moment — whatever it may look like — if needed.

(Ocala-Marion County webpage)Florida has three national parks — Everglades, Biscayne, and Dry Tortugas, all in the southern end of the state. Now newbie U.S. Rep. Randy Fine of Brevard County wants to create a fourth one, this time in the north end, for Florida’s springs.
He’s filed a bill, H.R.4656, called the “Path to Florida Springs National Park Act.” It directs the secretary of the Interior Department to conduct a study to “determine the suitability and feasibility of establishing Florida Springs National Park in Central and North Florida.”
“When I saw these Florida springs, places unlike anything else you’ll find in Florida, unlike anything else you’ll find in America, unlike anything else you’ll find in the world, I thought these, too, are worthy of designation,” Fine said during an Aug. 25 press conference at Juniper Springs to unveil his bill. “We literally are the Yellowstone of springs.”
The study area, spelled out in Fine’s bill, covers about 2,800 square miles between Jacksonville, Orlando, and Gainesville. That’s bigger than Biscayne (270 square miles), Dry Tortugas (100 square miles), and even Everglades National Park (2,350 square miles).
Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? But not everybody thinks Fine’s bill is so fine.
In fact, as the Daytona Beach News Journal reported last week, there’s now a petition opposing it. As of Wednesday, the number of signatures topped 8,000.
“While we value public access to natural spaces, this bill threatens the long-term health of one of Florida’s most ecologically sensitive regions,” says the Change.org petition.
They’re concerned that Fine’s park plan is just a ploy to promote commercial development in areas that are now quite placid.  
I wondered, who’s right? Whose vision for the springs truly springs from a desire to do right by these natural gems?
Measureless caverns
I have to say that Fine is not wrong about the wonderful qualities of our springs.
We have more springs gushing up from our aquifer than any other place on earth. Florida’s ancient inhabitants regarded them as sacred places.
Doug Stamm via Facebook
“One has to look at springs as the first Floridians would have, seemingly magical waters rising from the forest to provide a source of perpetual fresh water and food and a place to stay,” Doug Stamm, author of the authoritative guidebook “Springs of Florida,” once told me. “Who would not think that was a sacred gift of the Creator to be treasured?”
Pioneering naturalist William Bartram’s account of Florida’s springs inspired Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem about Kubla Khan and his “caverns measureless to man.”
The springs were our earliest tourist attraction. Unscrupulous hucksters convinced wealthy Northerners that the cure for what ailed them was to sit and soak in Florida’s therapeutic waters, even the ones that smelled like rotten eggs.
They’re still a major tourist draw. Who wouldn’t want to splash around in cool, bubbling waters on a hot summer day? Florida State University says just one, Wakulla Springs State Park, contributes about $20 million annually in tourism spending. Think of how much a dozen or so bring in!
Yet former Gov. Rick Scott and sitting Gov. Ron DeSantis have done an incredibly poor job of taking care of them. Lots of our springs now suffer from a loss of flow due to overpumping from the aquifer, as well as pollution caused by leaky sewer lines and septic tanks plus fertilizer and animal poop in stormwater runoff.
The springs were showing a steep decline in 2016 when the Legislature became alarmed. Legislators passed a law that said the Department of Environmental Protection “shall adopt uniform rules for issuing permits which prevent groundwater withdrawals that are harmful to the water resources and adopt by rule a uniform definition of the term ‘harmful to the water resources’ to provide water management districts with minimum standards necessary to be consistent with the overall water policy of the state.”
The law said the DEP had to complete that assignment by 2017. Instead, the agency gave itself another year, then another, then another, and so on. They kept hitting the snooze button, meanwhile issuing more and more of those damaging permits.
Imagine if you could do that with any law or order you didn’t like: “Sorry, Gov. D, I know you want this rainbow crosswalk painted out, but I’m giving myself another three years to comply.” It wouldn’t go over well, would it?
Then, in 2022, the DEP finally unveiled its new rules. They were pretty much the same rules as the ones in 2016 that had doomed the springs.
Ryan Smart via LinkedIn
An environmental group, the Florida Springs Council, has been fighting for years to get DEP to follow the law, so far with little success. I was curious about what their longtime executive director, Ryan Smart, thought of Fine’s national park proposal.
The answer: Not much.
“I can’t see any way in which it will benefit Florida’s springs,” he told me.
Restoring the springs
The idea of creating a national park featuring a lot of Florida springs has been floating around for several years, Smart told me. To him, it’s never made much sense.
For one thing, all of the springs within the proposed park are already permanently protected. They’re part of various state parks, state preserves, state forests, and national forests.
The ones that are state parks will be protected even better than a national park might, Smart said. Just this year, the Florida Legislature passed a new law to block any efforts — by the governor or anyone else — to bring golf courses, fancy lodges, pickleball, or some other not-a-park use. That means no commercial development can threaten them.
The state parks have another advantage over the national kind, he said. Local residents have input on management plans for the state parks. National parks are managed from Washington.
“Changing state parks or state forests into national forests or national parks,” Smart said, “doesn’t do any of the things that need to be done to actually restore the springs.” 
Hopeful but doubtful 
I talked to some more smart people besides just Smart.
Stamm told me that he thinks the national park study might be a good idea. But it would probably take too long and cost too much money to do the springs any good.
“I’m hopeful,” he told me, “but I doubt it will ever happen.”
Clay Henderson via subject
I made sure to call Clay Henderson, a former Florida Audubon president who has also written the definitive history of environmental land preservation in Florida, “Forces of Nature.”
He pointed out that a chunk of the study area lies within the Ocala National Forest, established in 1908 by order of President Teddy Roosevelt.
Thousands of people live within the forest boundaries, and they’re allowed to hunt there. If it were a national park, they would have to put their guns away.
“You can’t hunt in a national park,” he said.
He also reminded me that, under the sitting president — who Fine endorsed and who returned the favor when Fine ran for Congress — the budget and personnel for the National Park Service have been slashed to the bone.
Since the goal of the park service these days is to downsize, not add new parks, he said, “I don’t expect to see a favorable report.”
Re-run of a reject
The most interesting insights came from Haley Moody, executive director of the Howard T. Odom Florida Springs Institute. First opened 15 years ago, the institute in High Springs has done more than anyone else to take a deep dive into what makes the springs work and what’s harming them.
Haley Moody via Linkedin
According to Moody, her organization has already looked into protecting the springs by creating a national park — and rejected the idea.
“In 2021, we got a small grant from the National Parks Conservation Association,” Moody told me. “We worked on it for a couple of years to see if the idea had legs. We held several stakeholders’ meetings.”
A lot of the folks who live in the area “were not receptive to the idea of the federal government acquiring all the land,” she said. That doomed it.
Instead, she said, her organization is proposing something different: a Florida Springs National Heritage Area, which would not be as restrictive as a national park. It would cover the northern two-thirds of the state — everything north of Lake Okeechobee, basically. And the people who live in the area could contribute ideas on how best to protect it.
Fine would know all that if he’d just asked.
But he didn’t, so now we’re headed for a re-run of what the Florida Springs Institute rejected.
An expert visitor
I had a telephone chat with the congressman about all this. I confess I approached the call with some trepidation. When he was in the Legislature, Fine was widely regarded as the biggest hothead since the Fantastic Four’s Human Torch.
But perhaps being elected to Congress cooled him off. Rep. Fine and I had a very civil discussion, by which I mean he insulted other people but not me.
He told me he became interested in the national parks because he’s been taking his kids to visit as many of them as possible. So far, they’ve traveled to 61 out of the 63.
“I consider myself an expert on the national parks as a visitor,” he told me.
When he first saw the magnificence of a Florida spring, “I thought that the Florida springs should have a national designation too.”
When I asked why he didn’t consult any springs experts, he said that’s why he’s calling for a study. Let the experts weigh in then, not before the study gets off the ground.
When I mentioned the Change.org petition opposing his bill, he snapped, “How many are real people?” He compared the thousands of petitioners to the thousands of chatbots who follow his X account.
“The feedback I’ve gotten from actual humans has been good,” he told me.
He conceded that one of the petitioners’ concerns — that a national park would attract commercial development – is legitimate. But he had a response for that.
 “I thought there was a desire for more economic development,” he told me. “You can get a factory in there, or you can get something that protects the natural resources.”
When I mentioned some of the reservations I’d heard from people like Smart, he didn’t want to hear it.
“This bill should not be controversial on its face,” he said. “Anyone who opposes this idea is not a real environmentalist.”
Stop wasting time
When Fine told me he didn’t talk to any springs experts, he didn’t mean he didn’t discuss this with anyone, period. One person who did consult with the congressman on it was Jonathan Rubin, executive director and president of the Clean Earth Initiative.
Moody met him at the congressman’s press conference. She’d never heard of his organization before. Neither had Smart.
Jonathan Rubin via Linkedin
Maybe that’s because Rubin’s organization is fairly new. The Palm Beach County native started it less than a year ago. Before that, he spent four years running an organization in Boca Raton called Fresh Florida Farms to promote hydroponic crops.
Clean Earth Initiative’s website says it was set up to bring together a lot of different Florida environmental groups because “together, our voice is stronger and more effective.”
The 25 organizations who have joined so far range from the well-known Tropical Audubon Society to more obscure ones, such as the Crustacean Plantation. None of them are specifically for springs. In fact, most are from the southern half of the state.
Now Rubin is pushing the Florida Springs National Park and has even produced a video about it featuring Fine.
It occurred to me that the Clean Earth Institute might get the contract to do the study called for in Fine’s bill. When I asked Rubin about that, he said the decision would be up to the National Park Service.
I asked Rubin if he wrote the bill for Fine. After some hemming and hawing, he said he did not write it, but “I provided the proposal that his staff used to write the bill.”
He said the study will need to address important questions: “Do we close some of it to hunting or all of it? Do we allow commercial development on it or none?”
But those are questions that the Florida Springs Institute has already addressed. Why spend money that the National Park Service doesn’t have now, to study something that’s already been reviewed and rejected?
What would make more sense is if Fine were to use his clout with the Trump administration to put pressure on DeSantis to do his job. Maybe the White House could encourage him to focus on fixing the springs’ flow and pollution problems, instead of wasting his time painting over all those colorful crosswalks.

The easy grab, history shows, is authority-driven retaliation.","The picture remains blurred on the personal conflicts and motivations driving a 22-year-old video gamer, with developing thoughts on politics, to allegedly assassinate conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.
However, it’s clear we live in times again of deep social and political unrest, including inflammatory social, political, and cultural comments daily, similar to 1968, when the assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. also occurred in a charged environment.
Emotion often outruns reason, then tragedy strikes.
The Kirk shooting is only one of many horrendous, violent physical, verbal, and strategic attacks occurring as often as sipping water or targeting video game characters to die and resurrect with infinite resets of life. It’s also a time when we feel bodacious and entitled to be heard and forcefully thrust our beliefs on others.
In such a climate, we must be careful of the slippery slope of blaming fiery words as the cause of these actions and attitudes. The easy grab, history shows, is authority-driven retaliation, shrinking freedoms, and dissenters branded as enemies of law, order, reason, and the public good.
The paradox here is that fiery words come from all sides.
As an adjunct professor at Manchester Community College, I found this week a teaching moment —unlike most others— to discuss free speech, hate speech, and inciting speech with my students. The class at first was rooted in strong opinions without discernment between the expression of opinion and avoiding a blanket legal prohibition of those they find offensive.
What is acceptable one day could be unacceptable another, so how should we decide? I asked them.
The answers were all feeling-based, as I expected from 20-somethings. They haven’t the backgrounds, beliefs, or experiences to remember the 1960s; many can’t even express a clear understanding of the civil rights movement. They haven’t lived enough of life in many respects.
For them, as much as for the general public, it was an opportunity for educational understanding about the true value of their freedoms.
People make the polarized climate, I started explaining. Behavior about national issues stretches into your neighborhood, too. That same reflex plays out in local communities’ social media posts and public meeting comments, veering from unsettling to unhinged, some pushing the boundaries of what comes next.
So we must ask: What do we do about speech we strongly dislike —even hate— when the stakes are high, opinions differ, and emotions run strong, whether about national issues or local zoning, school, town, or city policy matters?
We, first, must hold two truths:

Yes, people’s words can harm —and the law must act when people cross clear lines.
But yes, a free society requires the freedom for people to speak, even when their speech offends. It is freedom for the thoughts we hate that matter most.

The legal standard is clear. Under Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), speech can only be punished if it is (1) intended to incite unlawful action, (2) imminent, and (3) likely to produce that unlawful act.
A second, more recent rule comes from Counterman v. Colorado (2023): true threats—particularly online— are only criminal if the speaker acted with at least recklessness. That means they knew their words could be seen as a threat and spoke anyway.
These standards draw a bright line. Ugly, outrageous, or offensive speech may still be legal. But direct incitement and true threats, made knowingly or recklessly, can and should be prosecuted.
What about social media? The law still applies.
Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, of the University of California’s Berkeley Law School, notes that Counterman helps courts distinguish real threats from hyperbole. University of California, Los Angeles’s Eugene Volokh adds that punishment should be limited to speech narrowly tied to imminent crime —not just because it’s inflammatory.
Nadine Strossen, former American Civil Liberties Union president, advocates “counter speech, not censorship” unless legal standards are met. Law scholar Danielle Citron argues that laws on threats, stalking, and “intimate privacy” already cover most online abuse. Other legal scholars, like Jack Balkin and Kate Klonick, remind us those platforms —not government— enforce most digital speech rules.
Where’s balance?
At a rally following the Kirk shooting, law professor Stephen E. Sachs urged the crowd to think differently about how we argue. It’s about how people handle their thoughts and feelings, separate considerations.
He drew on the writing of psychiatrist and essayist Scott Alexander (a pen name), who once noted that a short-term focus may be part of the problem.
As Sachs put it, “Everyone … knows that they are right. The only remaining problem is how to convince others. Go on Facebook and you will find a million people with a million different opinions, each confident in her own judgment, each zealously devoted to informing everyone else.”
Sachs acknowledged that debate can feel frustrating, slow, and rarely decisive. Yet he defended its worth, saying, “Logical debate has one advantage over narrative, rhetoric, and violence: it’s an asymmetric weapon. That is, it’s a weapon that is stronger in the hands of the good guys than in the hands of the bad guys.”
The professor contrasted the enduring strength of reason with the fleeting impact of coercion or force.
“You didn’t develop your opinions after a five-minute shouting match. You developed them after years of education and acculturation and engaging with hundreds of books and hundreds of people. Why should they (opponents) be any different?” Sachs said, urging patience and persistence.
He closed by reminding listeners that lasting change comes from teaching people “ways to distinguish truth from falsehood,” even when that learning must withstand blustery counterforce or competition in the marketplace of ideas for acceptance.
The path forward
Our laws regarding speech and incitement are meant in part to also help foster cooler heads. They also are directed at sending a message about prosecution to those who want to ignore the need in a democratic society for reason.
Reasoning —discernment— helps to define what is a harsh expression of opinion from a direct provocation that mobilizes or causes people to bring imminent harm to others or the country.
We have had much debate, especially with the Jan. 6 riots at the end of the last Trump administration, over that precise meaning.
As more facts emerge about the Utah shooting, let us mourn— but not lose our heads. Let’s also cool the often-inflammatory rhetoric on social media. Whether discussing national politics or town political or policy issues, let’s pause, observe, and ask: What is my intent? What’s the likely result? Can I disagree using discernment?
Let’s teach and model for our kids about that precise and detailed thinking, even if schools aren’t doing an adequate job with it. Parents and guardians need to be the controlling force.
We do this not because we’re hard on hate, but because we’re strong on liberty.
Student comments during and afterward were interesting, and the teaching moment broad and penetrating.
“Charlie did what a lot of people fear doing, which is ‘speaking out’ and ‘public speaking,’” one student said. “He took his freedom of speech and started a following with people who have the same beliefs and grew a platform, but he did more than that.”
“He also invited the people who didn’t have the same values/views as him, showing that freedom of speech isn’t just about expressing ideas but making room for difficult and uncomfortable conversations,” she added.
Yet, for most of these students and as mirrored by a CNN commentator this week, determining the line between “actionable” speech and vicious commentary is hard to distinguish.
Another student offered, “One crosses that line once the words they are saying start to entice violence against other groups, or just downright accepting violence, like when Charlie Kirk stated, ‘I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights’…or when he said, ‘Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.'”
“These statements accept violence and can be interpreted to entice violence against certain groups of people, and if left unchecked, this can turn into a 1930s Germany situation where people are calling for the extermination of certain ethnic/social/political groups (Jews, homosexuals, and Communists),” he added.
These and other kinds of comments required clarification, debate, discernment, and questioning —complex, difficult, and delayed in gratification for expressing a feeling or emotion,but needing to reconcile it with their thinking-level skills.
It is something many found startling in the face of discernment, but understandable as I, a nearly 70-year-old professor teaching nearly 40 years, looked at the youthful faces. They had much more of life to wrestle with yet.
The answer to hateful speech is not to ban all tough talk —but to uphold the law and protect the space for debate that includes thoughtful —perhaps sharp, even belligerent— commentary, but that avoids imminent provocation. It’s a thin line, almost impossible to define. It’s also one that preserves real free speech.
Let’s keep the Republic sane, I concluded. On that, they all agreed.

Driven by big dreams, tempered with strong work ethic and the resilience to overcome hardship, immigrants from every part of the world call this state home. This is as true today as it has been for generations. Immigrants have been integral to the state’s economic success, founding new businesses and developing world-changing inventions that have brought prosperity to native-born and immigrant alike.
Examples abound. The helicopter was invented by Connecticut’s Igor Sikorsky, who immigrated from Kiev, Ukraine – and for whom Sikorsky Aircraft is named.  Electric Boat, today the economic engine of Eastern Connecticut, was founded by immigrant Isaac Rice.  Holocaust survivor Joseph Gerber founded Gerber Scientific in Connecticut and revolutionized global manufacturing.
The hard work of immigrants is often hidden in plain sight – in the food we eat, the groceries we buy, the places we work.  Stop & Shop was founded by an immigrant family in New England, as were Big Y, Cumberland Farms, Sam’s Food Stores, and TJ Maxx.  Immigrants like Frank Pepe made New Haven the pizza capital of the world, and immigrant restaurateurs like Lobster Landing’s Enea Bacci and Mill On The River’s Helmar Wolf continue to shape our culinary culture today.  Carlos Mouta’s Parkville Market is a melting pot of cuisines brought to Connecticut from every part of the world.
The very face of our state was shaped by immigrants.  Hartford’s iconic Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch was designed by immigrant architect George Keller.  Another Irish immigrant, Kevin Roche, designed New Haven’s Knights of Columbus Building and Danbury’s Corporate Center – among many other famous works across the U.S.  Holocaust survivor David Chase revitalized Connecticut’s cities through the construction of Hartford’s Gold Building and Stilts Building, and New Haven’s Connecticut Financial Center.  The construction firms Gilbane, Manafort Brothers, and Tomasso Group, responsible for many of the largest projects in our state, were all established by immigrant tradesmen.
The next generation of thinkers and innovators are being educated at the University of Connecticut – led by an Immigrant Heritage Hall of Fame inductee, President Radenka Maric.  Yale’s School of Nursing is led by Persian immigrant Dean Azita Emami, and Yale’s School of Management is led by Guyanese immigrant Dean Kerwin Kofi Charles.  The chancellor of the CT State Colleges & Universities system, John Maduko, is the son of Igbo-Nigerian immigrants.
Immigrants continue to help our farmers raise crops, pick tobacco, and run Connecticut dairies.  It is hard and oftentimes dangerous work.  Yet, without the grit and determination of immigrants seeking a better life, there could well be no food on our tables.  This has been the case for each new generation: our state saw waves of Jewish, Swiss Apostolic, Italian, and Portuguese farmers over the course of just the 20th century alone.
Yet, every generation of immigrants has faced similar hostility from groups of Americans who mistakenly feared their differences.  Most who fear and reject immigrants today are descendants of immigrants who were similarly demonized.  The first Catholic immigrants were seen by many New Englanders as an existential threat.  It is now hard to imagine New England without their contributions.
At a time when newcomers face similar hostility, it is important that we remind ourselves, and others in our communities, of the contributions continually made by those who have come to this country and our state with an unyielding determination to build a new life for themselves and their families – and in pursuing that objective, contribute mightily to making America a better place.
Connecticut’s state motto, “Qui Transtulit Sustinet,” translates from Latin as “He who is transplanted, still sustains.”  Immigrants “transplanted” from elsewhere have indeed sustained  and thrived, and in doing so have strengthened the fabric of our state and nation.
Inspiring stories of immigrant achievement are celebrated at the Immigrant Heritage Hall of Fame’s annual induction ceremony.  


On September 25, we add four exemplary Connecticut immigrants to an impressive roster of inductees who have not only overcome obstacles to attain personal success, but who give back to the broader immigrant community and all who live here:

Ali Antar: emeritus professor of physics, founder and co-president of the Islamic Association of Greater Hartford, co-founder of the Muslim Coalition of Connecticut, interfaith leader, and a founding member of We Refuse to Be Enemies in coalition with Muslims, Jews, and Christians.
Dana Bucin: one of the most respected immigration attorneys in Connecticut, representing immigrants and refugees, including Afghan nationals applying for humanitarian status, and Ukrainian refugees following Russia’s full-scale invasion.
Demetrios Giannaros: economist, educator, and elected official, he served for 16 years in the Connecticut legislature, was Deputy Majority Leader and the first foreign-born individual to serve as Deputy Speaker.  Giannaros has served in numerous immigrant community nonprofit organizations, including the Connecticut Immigrant & Refugee Coalition.
Homa Naficy: founder of Hartford Public Library’s American Place, nationally-recognized for its work helping immigrants learn English, study for the citizenship exam, and succeed in their new homeland. Naficy was appointed by President Obama to serve on the National Museum and Library Services Board and served until 2023.

When residents from across Connecticut gather to honor these accomplished individuals, express our gratitude for their enduring contributions, and reflect on the remarkable history of immigrants in our state, past and present, it will be an appreciation well-earned and well deserved.  Evident as well will be the earnest hope that our shared pride will resonate not only here but well beyond Connecticut.
Asha Lassen is the president of the National Immigrant Heritage Center, the organizer of the annual Immigrant Heritage Hall of Fame event.  She serves as vice president of the Polish-American Foundation of Connecticut, and as vice president and chaplain of the American Legion Auxiliary Post 102 in Manchester.  More information about the Immigrant Heritage Hall of Fame Induction & Gala on September 25 is here.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/immigrant-heritage-1024x511.jpg,,,2025-09-18 00:56:40.793595

Sears",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/09/17/lawmakers-call-for-hearings-to-review-broken-social-services-administration/,"Maryland lawmakers plan to hold hearings in coming weeks on reports that the Social Services Administration may have let children in its care be housed with registered sex offenders, just one of many allegations in an audit of a ""broken"" agency.","Maryland lawmakers say they expect to hold hearings in the coming weeks on a new audit that uncovered a litany of problems at the Social Services Administration.  (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland lawmakers plan to hold hearings in coming weeks on reports that the Social Services Administration may have let children in its care be housed with registered sex offenders, just one of many allegations in an audit of a “broken” agency.
“We need to make sure that the state — who is charged with overseeing their care — is doing so in the best way possible and ensuring the safety of these children,” said Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), co-chair of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee, which received the audit on the administration Wednesday.
Hettleman said she expects the committee will hold a hearing in the near future to investigate issues at the administration, a unit of the Department of Human Services that oversees the delivery of care by the state’s 24 local social service departments to about 24,000 children.
The 70-page report from the Office of Legislative Audits found that, among other problems, the state may have approved the placement of children in  homes at addresses that were also listed as the address for seven registered sex offenders. Auditors also found that one group of foster care homes had an employee how had been convicted of sexual abuse of a minor, and another vendor that provided care for children being housed in hotels had an employee who was convicted of murder in 1990 — although it was not clear if that employee had access to children.
State may have put children in homes where registered sex offenders lived

Lisae Jordan, executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said that many children end up in foster care because of sexual assault — she said 28.4% of the child abuse or neglect in Maryland in 2020 was sexual abuse. Placing those children in the care of registered sex offenders is “beyond irresponsible,” she said.
“Rather than protecting them [children], the state is apparently exposing them further,” she said. “They’re one of the most vulnerable people in Maryland and they deserve better.”

Auditors said that many of the problems identified in the newest report were included in previous of the administration, but that they have not been addressed. The audit concluded that the SSA’s accountability and compliance level was unsatisfactory for the third audit in a row, with some repeated findings dating back to 2008.
That did not surprise Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel), who chaired the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee three years ago when it held a hearing to review the same issues at the administration.
“This goes back a long way, you know,” Lam said Wednesday. “While it still continues to this day, this extends as far back as audits that go only back to 2017 and there have been repeat audit findings that have come up in the past.”
Lam agreed with the auditors’ conclusion that job vacancies at the SSA “contributed, at least in part” to the problems. The audit said that the administration reported a vacancy rate of 12% to 22% over the last four years, and that as of June 30, 2024, about 19% of the agency’s 141 positions were vacant.
“You’re operating with an agency that’s very hollowed out … and so I think they probably are understaffed and don’t have enough people to be able to address all these concerns as well,” Lam said.
In a statement from the Maryland House Republican Caucus, GOP lawmakers said the audit’s findings were “not just disgusting and infuriating, but absolutely heartbreaking.”
“These are children who are under the care and guardianship of the state and deserve every protection we can give them,” said Assistant Minority Leader April Rose (R-Frederick and Carroll) in the statement. “This is a complete failure of the state’s most basic responsibility.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Chief Deputy Minority Whip Wayne Hartman (R-Lower Shore) concluded the statement by saying there is “no excuse, absolutely no excuse, for “this level of complete negligence.”
Lam cited what he thinks is a “void in leadership” at the administration to address the problems.
“I think it’s clear from this audit that this is a broken agency, that the Social Services Administration has a long way to go in reforming their practices, bringing it up to standards and ensuring the safety of those that are under their care,” he said.
He said lawmakers could withhold funding from the administration, but said doing that to an already understaffed and underfunded agency “doesn’t seem incredibly appetizing.” The other option, he said, is “to redouble our efforts to hold their feet to the fire and make sure that they’re accountable in response to these concerns.”
“So then we’re only left with the other tool, which is every couple years, bringing them up before the joint audit committee and hoping that public shaming will be effective in getting them to step up and address these significant fundamental shortcomings in their processes,” Lam said.
“Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to have had much of an impact either, because we’re facing a lot of the same findings of a broken department,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0490-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 23:56:29.279187

Moore is sweating: Should Maryland adopt Trump’s education tax credits?,Kalman Hettleman,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/09/17/gov-moore-is-sweating-should-maryland-adopt-trumps-education-tax-credits/,"Politically, governors in blue states may have no choice but to accept the disastrous education tax credits in the Big Beautiful Bill, writes Kalman Hettleman, but that doesn't mean they can't turn it to their -- and to public education's -- advantage.","The education tax credit included in the Big Beautiful Bill will take effect in 2027 and could weaken public schools, but blue states might be able to turn it to their advangtage, writes Kalman Hettleman. (Stock photo/Getty Images)School reform desperately needs to be jolted out of its disastrous policy and political stalemate. But not the big jolt in the big education tax credits in President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.
The tax credits seriously threaten the survival of public education. Here’s why.
For many years, Republicans have been zealously pushing school choice, like vouchers, and making headway in red states. I have warned of the dangers in this trend. But the tax credits under the BBB are a national gamechanger.
Parents of school-age children will be able to get a $1,700 tax credit for contributions to a nonprofit scholarship-granting organization (SGO). SGOs can distribute the funds to almost any school, with private secular and religious schools being the recipients sought by conservatives.
There are many open questions about how it will work. But the Treasury Department, under Trump, has great leeway in promulgating regulations that are sure to maximize the potential damage.
Liberal opponents cite many objections. First, it will accelerate a mass exodus of parents from public schools, costing schools precious funds and leaving them students who are mainly poor and of color. This will happen because parents with incomes of as much $300,000 in Maryland and other states could qualify.
Parents of disadvantaged students can get the credits too. But they are much less likely to apply because they lack the know-how to access the application process; and the $1,700 tax credit will not come close to paying the full cost of private schools.

Second, the tax credits will further erode the separation of church and state. Religious groups will probably be able to form their own SGOs, and in states with voucher programs, the vast majority have been used for religious schools. This means that all taxpayers are funding religious schools.
Third, while the tax credits will be paid out of federal funds, those funds could be better spent on public schools. The BBB credits will cost as much as $51 billion, which greatly exceeds the $30 billion in current federal aid for poor and disabled students. The stratospheric cost of the credits destroys even the remote possibility of more federal funds for public schools in the years ahead.
Under the BBB, states can opt out of the tax credit program. But that’s more political curse than blessing for elected officials in blue states. If they opt out, many constituents will lose valuable benefits, thus accelerating Democrats’ freefall from their former political superiority over Republicans on education policy.
Polls show growing support of Democrats for choice programs like tax credits. The CEO of Democrats for Education Reform says, “We’re not delivering policy-wise and are losing support politically.”
The dilemma is causing governors in blue states to sweat and waffle. Gov. Wes Moore is one of them.
But they may have a partial escape route.  A Brookings Institute report points out how tax credits “could become a boon for educational choice in red states and educational enrichment in blue states.”
The liberal journalist, Paul Gastris, encourages blue states to “Tutorize, Don’t Privatize, Public Schools.” Conservative efforts, like the BBB credits, “could be a golden opportunity for Democrats.”
How so? The BBB allows scholarship funds to cover a wide range of student services, not just tuition, but tutoring, services for students with disabilities, supplies like books and computers, and transportation.
Moreover, states can regulate requirements for SGOs and prohibit them from discrimination based on sexual orientation or religion.
So, how is all this likely to play out? That’s hard to say until the regulations are finalized.
One key variable involves how SGOs will be required or allowed to select which parents get what amounts of money. Another revolves around the mandate that SGOs are not allowed to earmark contributions for students whose parents were donors. This provision is certain to provoke intrigue and political maneuvering as donors seek favoritism.
The one certainty is continuing controversy. In the meantime, governors like Moore must confront the policy options and political trade-offs.
It’s hard to say exactly what those options are until the Treasury regulations are finalized. But it seems to me that, because of the wide political appeal of the tax credits, they have little choice but to embrace them in some way.  Sadly, chalk it up as another Trump triumph over the future of public education.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-115093584-scaled-1-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-09-17 23:56:29.279187

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Officials at the University of Alaska said this week that previously announced cuts to federally funded programs for Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian students will be worse than initially thought. 
At the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the canceled funding will amount to an estimated $8.8 million, and University of Alaska Southeast programs will also be affected but to a lesser degree. 
“​​It was quite a shock, because there was no forewarning to this,” said Bryan Uher, interim vice chancellor for rural, community and Native education at UAF in a phone interview Wednesday. 
Uher said the elimination of the grant funding for the University of Alaska Fairbanks affects programs at the Bristol Bay campus in Dillingham and in Fairbanks at the Community and Technical College focused on career training and workforce development, as well as student services. 
In total, for the five year grant programs, Uher said the cancellation is estimated at $8.8 million of $12.9 million in grant funding previously awarded.
“This award funding is unique in that it funds faculty for new program development, and then it also funds staff for student support — so advisors, outreach, individual wellness coordinators, admissions, graduation – student services, essentially,” he said. 
Uher said new programs in development that will be impacted — for students in person or through distance education — include American Sign Language, information technology technician training and private pilot ground school, helping students train for their pilot’s license.
Uher said those programs will continue through this academic year, and then the university will evaluate whether or how to continue them. University officials say they were given one year to close out grant-funded programs. 
UAF includes campuses in Fairbanks, Dillingham, Bethel, Nome and Kotzebue. Uher said while these programs must have at least 20% Native students to be eligible for the funding, they serve a wider student population, especially student services at rural campuses that serve wider regions of rural Alaska. 
“They provide follow ups, financial aid support like, how do you apply for financial aid? Are there scholarships out there?” Uher said. “They provide financial literacy to students. So it really is a comprehensive service that we provide to these students who are not living in or located in urban centers like Fairbanks or Anchorage.”
An estimated 17% of the University of Alaska student population identified as Alaska Native in 2024, or 3,254 students statewide, and roughly 1.3% or 266 students identified as Native Hawaiian. 
UAA and UAS expect less impact
University of Alaska Anchorage has grant-funded programs for Native students, but officials say they are not expecting them to be affected.
University of Alaska Southeast Chancellor Aparna Palmer said in a university-wide email Monday that a grant-funded program on its Sitka campus to support student services is already set to end this month, and the university is authorized to continue to spend remaining funds for another year. 
“I want to assure you that we will continue to support the many ways in which we are rooted in Alaska Native culture, history, language, and arts,” Palmer said, adding emphasis by underlining her statement.
Palmer said programs and courses in Indigenous studies, as well as support for Indigenous students, will continue. “Our programs and courses in Indigenous Studies at UAS are strong and will continue to thrive and grow. The UA President, Pat Pitney, and I are fully aligned on this,” she said. “Our Native and Rural Student Center will continue to be a space that provides support for Alaska Native students while welcoming all students.”
Faculty union president Jill Dumesnill, professor of mathematics at UAS, said by email on Monday that the announcement also disrupts future programs, faculty positions and student services.
“Writing these grant applications takes an enormous amount of faculty time and effort, and the Sitka proposal would have provided two additional faculty on the Sitka campus. That loss is significant because there are currently no Alaskan Native faculty members on the Sitka campus,” she said. “You don’t make campuses welcoming simply by calling them welcoming.”
Alaska’s U.S. Senators say they’re working to fund higher education
U.S. Sen Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in a statement Wednesday that the funds are already legally authorized by Congress, and support students as well as address workforce shortages in the state.

“I am working with my colleagues to reinforce to the administration that these are statutory grant programs authorized and appropriated by Congress that align with the President’s goal of providing career technical education to the next generation for high-impact workforce needs such as fisheries, healthcare, skilled trades, and energy,” Murksowski said.
“As Alaska partners with this administration on several large-scale and exciting projects that can help transform our state, we need a local workforce trained to meet this moment,” she said. “Cancelling these funds takes us further away from that objective.” 
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, also repeated the impact on career training and workforce development education.
“Senator Sullivan and his team are in touch with the Department of Education regarding these grants. The University of Alaska serves thousands of students across the state, including Alaska Natives, and provides critical programs, such as job training and technical education, that build up Alaska’s trained workforce. President Trump’s Day 1 executive order to ‘Unleash Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential’ makes it clear we must be training the next generation to power projects like the Alaska LNG pipeline and keep these good-paying jobs in Alaska,” said spokesperson Amanda Coyne by email on Tuesday. 
“Senator Sullivan will continue to work with the administration to fund secondary education and job training to continue building up Alaska’s economy and workforce,” she said. 
Alaska’s U.S. House Representative Nick Begich did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. 
The announcement follows the Trump administration’s move to cancel $350 million in congressionally approved grant funding for minority-serving institutions last week, saying the funds will be allocated elsewhere. 
There are an estimated 5 million students enrolled in 800 minority-serving institutions nationwide. The grant funding is aimed at supporting students of color and from low-income backgrounds to pursue and complete higher education.

They argue that if Wood’s appointment stands, it would give attorneys four of the six seats on the Alaska Judicial Council, the state board that accepts applications for judicial vacancies, selects nominees and forwards them to the governor for final selection.
Under the Alaska Constitution, the council consists of three attorneys picked by the Alaska Bar Association and three non-lawyer members of the public appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature. In ties, the chief justice of the Alaska Supreme Court may cast a seventh vote.
The state contends that Wood is no longer an attorney and that he was a valid pick for an open seat. Both sides have asked for summary judgment, allowing Judge Yvonne Lamoureux to decide the case short of trial.
Wood’s appointment has been challenged on three main points. First, was the governor’s choice a valid recess appointment? Second, is Wood an attorney? Third, was he employed by the state at the time of the appointment?
Dunleavy appointed Wood in a letter dated May 29, filling a position that had been vacant since March, when a prior appointment expired. That was after the Legislature had adjourned for the year.
Under the Alaska Constitution and state law, a governor may fill vacant positions on boards and commissions when the Legislature is out of session, but the appointee will be subject to confirmation during the next regular legislative session.
Attorney James Reeves, arguing on behalf of Alaskans for Fair Courts, said his group contends that because a position on the Judicial Council became vacant during the legislative session, Wood may not begin serving until a confirmation vote takes place.
That contradicts existing practice, and Alaska Department of Law attorney Claire C. Keneally said in court on Wednesday that “it’s also not supported by the history of the (Alaska) Constitution” or the clause of the constitution that deals with appointments that take place when the Legislature is out of session.
“This is not a new or novel practice,” Keneally said of Dunleavy’s decision to not fill a March vacancy until May.
In 2015, then-Gov. Bill Walker filled a public seat on the Alaska Judicial Council in October; that seat had also been vacant since March, when the Legislature was in session.
Because of that timing issue, Keneally argued both in court and in writing, the case should be dismissed. Other arguments would be ripe for discussion only if the Legislature approves Wood’s appointment.
Wood was granted a law license in 1972, but it was suspended in 2000 because of a failure to pay dues to the Alaska Bar Association. Under a sworn affidavit, Wood said he has not practiced law since 2000 and has no intention of practicing law.
But in court on Wednesday, Reeves with Alaskans for Fair Courts said, “the Constitutional Convention history, which both sides have cited, indicates that the framers who discussed this understood the word non-attorney to mean layman or lay member. Is a lawyer who chooses not to practice law a layman?”
Reeves and attorney Joseph Geldhof, who was representing James Forrer in a separate but combined lawsuit also challenging Wood’s appointment, argued that because Wood held a state consulting contract at the time of his appointment, he was ineligible to serve on the Judicial Council.
The contract calls for Wood to advise the Alaska Department of Law on labor relations matters and to provide advice to the governor’s office when needed.
The Alaska Constitution states that no member of the Judicial Council may hold “any other office or position of profit under the United States or the state.”
But Keneally noted that the Alaska Supreme Court has previously interpreted that phrase to mean “salaried, non-temporary employment” with the state, and that other members of the Alaska Judicial Council, including some current members, have also held state contracts while serving on the council. 
Lamoureux, who heard Wednesday’s arguments, said she intends to issue a written order within 30 days, the timeline requested by both sides of the case in order to allow a speedy appeal.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/220728-Alaska-Beacon-1024x735.jpg,,,2025-09-17 22:57:05.141376

It's time to acknowledge that the way Massachusetts and other states have largely been teaching science isn't getting the job done and look for better options and bright spots.
The post Declines in science scores should prompt big change in schools appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","ON VISITS TO Chelsea Public Schools, I’ve observed 6-year-olds enthusiastically discussing what materials to use to design a scoop that removes trash from water. They draw on observations from testing paper, foam, and plastic screens. Each group selects the material that worked best. Then, with their teacher, they examine the class data, lining the materials up in rows to make a physical bar graph. 
It’s a lesson in math, science, and engineering all at once, and the engagement and learning are off the charts.
New science scores released last week from the Nation’s Report Card, also known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, indicate we need more of these kinds of innovative approaches to science instruction in K-12 schools across Massachusetts and the country.
Scores in science show that eighth graders nationwide experienced a four-point score drop since 2019, the last time the test was administered. Only about a third of students are working at the NAEP proficient level, which is the goal and means they can do challenging work. Nearly 40 percent aren’t even reaching the basic level, indicating they likely can’t identify characteristics of mammals or the function of a human organ system like the circulatory system.
At the state level, Massachusetts’s MCAS scores also highlight a need for concern—in 2024 only 39 percent of students in grade 8 and 45 percent in grade 5 scored “meeting expectations” or higher on the science, technology, and engineering test.
The slide in science comes on the heels of reading and math declines. Because there’s been such an emphasis on improving achievement in those core subjects, which are at the center of federal school accountability policies, science instruction has been increasingly deemphasized, particularly at the elementary level.
But the Chelsea example shows things don’t have to be this way. By integrating subjects, we can add more science and engineering into the curriculum and help students improve academically across a range of critical subjects.
The scores aren’t the only signs of trouble in the latest results from the Nation’s Report Card. Accompanying survey data show student enjoyment in science class is down, as are opportunities for hands-on, inquiry-based learning. Students report spending less time in school, for example, designing experiments to answer research questions or using evidence from experiments to explain a scientific phenomenon.
In other words, textbooks, worksheets, and lectures are probably how most kids are learning science. While there’s a place for these, they shouldn’t dominate science instruction because the approach is too passive and fails to foster student engagement or build skills like critical thinking and collaboration.
Schools sometimes have trouble finding research-based, high-quality, hands-on science lessons and instructional materials. For help, they can look to STEM organizations. The Museum of Science, where I lead STEM learning, offers free pK-8 STEM curricula. Other organizations that create science-based instructional materials include OpenSciEd, the Smithsonian Science Education Center, and the Lawrence Hall of Science. 
The decline in NAEP science scores, like in other areas, was steepest for low-performing or academically struggling students, who can especially benefit from hands-on approaches that allow them to demonstrate their learning in multiple ways. In Chelsea, we’ve tried to improve access to STEM lessons in the school day as well as through afterschool, summer school, and family programs. 
Students also thrive when they connect their coursework to the world around them. Science and engineering are ideal for this kind of interdisciplinary, real-world learning. For example, as second graders learn about plants, they can nurture them in a classroom container or school garden and explore their favorite fruits and vegetables with friends and family. 
Such a unit weaves together science topics like life cycles of plants and pollinators, math themes like measurement, and engineering practices like designing hand pollinators. Importantly, students enjoy learning this way—when Chelsea piloted this approach, students, parents, and educators all wanted more of it.
Isn’t that what we want for all our kids?
STEM fields are a vital and growing part of the economy. But whatever path students choose in life, they’ll need a solid K-12 foundation in science.
It’s time to acknowledge that the way Massachusetts and other states have largely been teaching science isn’t getting the job done and look for better options and bright spots. Let’s get creative, give kids the chance to learn STEM and other subjects on a deeper level, and maybe even let them have some fun along the way.
Christine Cunningham is senior vice president of STEM learning at Boston’s Museum of Science and a member of the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policy for the Nation’s Report Card.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)The elected vice chairperson for the Montana Democratic Party resigned his post just days after taking office following remarks critical of former U.S. Sen. Jon Tester.
This weekend at their state convention, Montana Democrats elected new executive leadership, including Shannon O’Brien as chairperson and Max Johansen as vice chairperson.
O’Brien pledged a fresh start for Democrats, according to media outlets at the convention including the Montana State News Bureau. Democrats have lost elections handily in Montana in recent years.
O’Brien is a former state senator from Missoula, previous head of Missoula College and education policy advisor to former Gov. Steve Bullock. She ran an unsuccessful bid for Superintendent of the Office of Public Instruction in 2024.
Just days after the Sunday convention, the Montana Democratic Party released a statement from O’Brien on the resignation of Johansen as vice chairperson on the executive board. O’Brien did not respond to voicemails requesting comment this week.
Johansen is chairperson of the Park County Democrats.
“This morning, I accepted the resignation of Max Johansen, creating a vacancy on the Montana Democratic Party Executive Board,” O’Brien said in the statement Wednesday. “Mr. Johansen resigned after acknowledging that certain comments he made following the convention were disruptive and inconsistent with the direction of the executive board.”
The Montana Free Press reported that Johansen criticized Tester, a Democrat who lost his bid for a fourth term in the U.S. Senate in November 2024, after the election at the convention in a conversation with reporters.
Johansen said “a lot of people” are upset with Tester for not being as aggressive as he could be in opposing Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, who ousted him, according to the Free Press. He also said Democrats need to “stop running” from the word “socialist” in reference to “direct aid” to vulnerable groups.
In a “Grounded” podcast episode following the convention, Tester responded. “Grounded” is a conversation between Tester and journalist Maritsa Georgiou, and Georgiou raised Johansen’s claims in the episode.
Tester, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, said on the show Johansen “doesn’t know Jacks–t,” he doesn’t know Montana, and he’s dangerous to Democrats.
“The Democrats have a fox in the henhouse, and if they don’t clean it up, there won’t be any eggs to pick,” Tester said.
The Daily Montanan could not reach Johansen for comment late Wednesday.
At their convention, the Montana Democrats said they also selected the following leaders, in addition to other district members:
Treasurer: Lance Fourstar
Secretary: Melody Cunningham
Eastern District Chairperson (Female): Hannah Nash
Eastern District Chairperson (Male): Jakob Miles
Western District Chairperson (Female): Linda Schmitt

WASHINGTON — Ramona Klein admits she was “an instigator” at Fort Totten Indian Boarding School in North Dakota.
“We didn’t have toys. We didn’t have anything to play with. And we went to bed at 6:30 as little girls,” she told a crowd Tuesday, Sept. 16, at a National Day of Remembrance recognizing boarding school survivors and descendants.

Klein, who attended the school from 1954 to 1958, would wake up in the middle of the night and wake the other girls. They’d whip the scratchy, rough, Army-issued blankets on the floor while two girls sat on it and “we’d get sparks.”
“It’s like [the] Fourth of July. So we would laugh. That was fun,” she said. Then they’d get bored and slide down the stairs on the mattress.
The beatings that inevitably followed didn’t break her.
“I would not cry,” she told the crowd. “I distinctly remember saying, ‘You’re not going to get the best of me.’”
More than two dozen people gathered Tuesday on a rainy day in the nation’s capital for the event hosted by the National Native American Boarding School Coalition at the Indian Gaming Association. The organization, known as NABS, advocates for Native peoples affected by U.S. federal Indian boarding school policies.
The remembrance included a candlelight vigil, songs, and talks by survivors and their families.

Since 2021, the organization has informally observed Sept. 30 as the National Day of Remembrance for those who attended U.S. federal Indian boarding schools, survivors, their communities, and their families. This year the organization recognized it a bit early to coincide with the National Congress of American Indians’ Tribal Unity Impact Days in Washington, D.C.
‘A little bit more joy’
Klein, the first vice president on the organization’s board of directors, uses her experience and voice to encourage other survivors to speak up.
The organization has been traveling around the country to permanently document the experience of boarding school survivors, the Oral History Project, as part of the U.S. Department of Interior’s Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative that was started by former Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, Laguna Pueblo.
Klein, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, recently traveled to the northwest for the project and witnessed five generations in one family speaking up, including the 90-something-year-old great-great-grandma.
“I think it’s the first time some of them really spoke with feeling, of their feelings with each other and helped understand some of what some people might call dysfunction,” she said. “But I think we’re used to functioning that way. … You know, it’s not necessarily dysfunction.”
It’s because of the U.S. federal Indian boarding school experiences and trauma that they are the way they are, she said. And to release that now, after so many years, is cathartic for many.
“To see people after they share their story, especially people who share their story maybe for the first time, they seem lighter,” she said. “There’s a little bit more joy.”
Ponka-We Victors-Cozad, NABS director of policy and advocacy, said the organization is still advocating for legislation in the U.S Congress to establish the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act. A bill proposing the commission was introduced in July 2025 by Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, and Oklahoma Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, Chickasaw, will be introducing one in the House soon. Victors-Cozad is Tohono O’odham and Ponca.
The Senate bill outlines that it will establish the Truth and Healing Commission and that the commission must investigate the impacts and ongoing effects of the Indian boarding school policies, under which American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children were forcibly removed from their family homes and placed in boarding schools.

The bill calls for the commission to develop recommendations on ways to protect unmarked graves and accompanying land protections; support repatriation and identify the tribal nations from which children were taken; and discontinue the removal of Indigenous children from their families and tribal communities by state social service departments, foster care agencies, and adoption agencies.
The Office of Army Cemeteries has begun the disinterment process at the former site of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, with 19 graves this fall – the highest in a year. One of the children disinterred is a Seminole Nation of Oklahoma student, Wallace Perryman, who was one of the last to be buried at the school at age 20. His remains are set to go home to the Seminole. The Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes will repatriate the remains of 18 other children.  Both tribes declined to comment about the repatriations.
 Paving the way for others

Klein and Deb Parker, the organization’s outgoing chief executive officer, reminded everyone that the Day of Remembrance is a time of celebration “because we’re survivors.”

(Photo by Charles Fox for ICT)

Parker, who is Tulalip, Yaqui and Apache, said as tribal nations are growing, it is important to remember those who paved the way to get there — those who survived and those who didn’t.
“That’s including those who were beaten if they spoke their language,” Parker said. “And yet, so many of those children wouldn’t give up their language. They kept speaking in corners. They kept speaking behind buildings, so that they would never forget who they are. And so it’s because of those children we carry on with our culture, with our language, with our identity.”
She continued, “And so where it’s a time of reverence, a time of introspection, it’s also a time of celebrating those who made it home and honoring those who carried those teachings forward, so that we can be here today.”
Other events are set for Sept. 30, which is a national holiday in Canada now known as the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. Canada’s remembrance started as Orange Shirt Day, named on behalf of a First Nations woman whose orange shirt, a gift from her grandmother, was taken from her when she arrived at residential school in Canada.
The use of orange shirts as a symbol of support for the boarding school students and their families has now spread broadly, and officials are encouraging people in the U.S. to wear an orange shirt to honor the survivors and support community healing.
Among the celebrations scheduled this year are a National Day of Remembrance on Sept. 30 at the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, and a film screening and gathering on Sept. 29 at the University of Nevada Las Vegas Student Union Theater.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Law enforcement investigators have confirmed an accidental display of the 1985 Jackie Chan movie “The Protector” was the source of nude images seen on state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ office TV.
Oklahoma County Sheriff Tommie Johnson III discussed the investigation with reporters Wednesday afternoon after county District Attorney Vicki Behenna announced her office would not pursue criminal charges against Walters over the incident.
“It is truly, purely an accident,” Johnson said.
He said his investigators showed clips from “The Protector” to the two Oklahoma State Board of Education members who reported seeing naked women on the TV in Walters’ office during the board’s July 24 meeting. The board was in the middle of a private portion of its meeting, called executive session, at the Oklahoma State Department of Education building.
The board members, Becky Carson and Ryan Deatherage, confirmed to the Sheriff’s Office that the movie was consistent with what they saw on the TV, Johnson said. “The Protector” includes multiple scenes involving nude women.

Carson said criminal charges didn’t cross her mind when she first filed a complaint about the explicit images, but “silence was never an option for me.”
“The DAs decision today doesn’t change anything,” Carson wrote in a message to Oklahoma Voice. “It doesn’t change the facts of what happened. It doesn’t change the fact that Oklahoma is still 50th in Education. It doesn’t change the fact that there isn’t a plan to move us from that position. It doesn’t change the fact that we as a board have a job to do.”
Deatherage did not return a request for comment Wednesday.
The District Attorney’s Office determined the evidence in the case is insufficient for criminal charges, Behenna announced Wednesday morning, more than a month after the Sheriff’s Office turned over the investigative findings for prosecutors to review.
Although investigators confirmed Carson and Deatherage’s report of seeing naked women on Walters’ TV, the state superintendent on Wednesday again accused the board members of falsehood.
“This concludes the biggest witch hunt in Oklahoma history,” Walters said in a statement. “Lies were spread about me and my character. Not only did the liberal lying media and my accusers sacrifice the truth, they worked to create a narrative to tear my agenda down and mission to reform Oklahoma schools and put parents back in charge. Liberal lies lost again.”

During a visit to Walters’ office on July 28, the sheriff’s investigators turned on the TV and found it was already set to Samsung’s Movie Hub Action channel. 
Samsung later shared the channel’s broadcast schedule with the Sheriff’s Office, and investigators confirmed “The Protector” would have been showing on Movie Hub Action at the time of the state Board of Education meeting, Johnson said.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, was the first to reveal an accidental showing of “The Protector” as the likely source of the controversy. Hilbert also obtained the channel’s broadcast information from Samsung, and he shared his findings in a public report on Aug. 5 while law enforcement was still investigating.
Johnson said Hilbert’s report “came out prematurely.”
“He just wanted to bring it to a close, as well,” Johnson said. “Not the appropriate way to go, but his heart was in the right place.
“You saw a guy just trying to solve a problem. We’ve talked through it.”
Walters also came out too soon with public statements about the investigation, Johnson said. A day after Walters interviewed with investigators, he held a press conference and claimed he had been fully cleared of wrongdoing.
“To suggest we would run a 24-hour investigation, that is not the case,” Johnson said.

Josh Shapiro said at a press conference. “We need to do better as a society.""","Governor Josh Shapiro and the Pennsylvania State Police commissioner offer details on a shooting in York County that left three police officers dead. (Photo courtesy of Commonwealth Media Services)*This is a breaking news story. We’ll move quickly to provide the best information we have at the time.*
Three law enforcement officers were shot and killed in North Codorus Township, York County, on Wednesday during an investigation into a “domestic-related” incident that happened at a home there the previous day, state police said. 
Two others were wounded and were in critical, but stable, condition Wednesday night. The suspect was killed by police, according to State Police Commissioner Col. Christopher Paris.
As of 6:15 p.m. Wednesday evening, there was no active threat to the public, Paris said at a press conference.
“Our hearts and prayers go out to them, to the families of the deceased and the families of those officers who were wounded,” Paris said. “There are simply no words that I can offer to assuage the grief that this community has experienced, and unfortunately will continue to experience.”
The injured officers are being treated at WellSpan York Hospital. Paris did not share which law enforcement agencies the officers who were shot worked for, and noted that many details would not be made public until the investigation progresses.
It’s the second time a York County officer has been killed in the line of duty this year. In February, West York Patrolman Andrew Duarte was killed during a hostage situation at UPMC Memorial Hospital in York.
Gov. Josh Shapiro, who made a speech against political violence last night in Pittsburgh at the Eradicate Hate Global Summit, travelled to York County Wednesday.
“This kind of violence isn’t ok,” he said at a press conference. “We need to do better as a society. We need to help the people who think that picking up a gun, picking up a weapon, is the answer to resolving disputes. We need to do better when it comes to mental health.”
It was the deadliest single day for law enforcement in the commonwealth since the Pennsylvania Fraternal Order of Police began keeping track on their fallen heroes page, which dates back to 2012. On April 4 2009, three officers were killed in a shooting in the Stanton Hill neighborhood in Pittsburgh after responding to a domestic call. Two others were wounded.

The name of the suspect in Wednesday’s shooting was not released, but the incident took place near a home on Haar Road.
Phoebe Luckenbaugh, who lives several houses away from where the shooting happened, said the property with a farmhouse and a red barn close to the road was home to a young family.
Craig Zumbrum, who is listed in property records as the owner with his wife, Elizabeth, died in 2023. His widow and four children, including two teenagers, still live in the home and were often seen in the yard, Luckenbaugh said.
“They’re a nice normal country family,” she said, adding that she has no first-hand knowledge of what happened at the farm Wednesday. Since Craig Zumbrum’s death, a relative has raised crops on the farm for the family, Luckenbaugh said.
State Police are asking the public to avoid the scene.
Paris said that state police will lead the investigation, in collaboration with York County District Attorney Tim Barker. He added that state police have been in touch with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s office in Philadelphia.
“I can assure you that all of the resources of the Pennsylvania state police are being brought to bear,” Paris said. He added that, for the time, state police will be taking over calls for service for the Northern York County Regional Police Department.
Shapiro said he was contacted by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who he said “shared with me we have the full support of the federal government.”
“We so appreciate law enforcement at every level, and we of course appreciate our federal partners,” Shapiro added.
Bondi said in a post on the social media platform X that the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were on the scene.
“Violence against law enforcement is a scourge on our society and never acceptable,” she wrote. “Pray for the officers involved.”
Attorney General Dave Sunday, who previously served as the York County District Attorney, said on social media that he was travelling to the county after hearing about the incident.
“Learning that three officers were killed in York County where I worked for many years as a prosecutor, and where I still call home, is unfathomable,” he said in a statement. “Having served alongside these officers, I know of their caliber, their professionalism and the lasting impact they had on our community. This loss is a heart-wrenching reminder of the sacrifices police officers and other first responders make every single day.”
Shapiro has ordered flags in the commonwealth to be flown at half-staff until the officers are interred. No date has been set yet.

Ibarra and Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/09/covid-vaccine-western-alliance/,"Leading medical organizations informed the state's new guidelines, announced as part of a western states alliance. A new law requires insurers to cover vaccines for most Californians.","In summary
Leading medical organizations informed the state’s new guidelines, announced as part of a western states alliance. A new law requires insurers to cover vaccines for most Californians.


In anticipation of restrictive federal immunization rules, state health officials issued their own vaccination guidelines on Wednesday, recommending that all Californians 6 months and older who want protection from the COVID-19 virus get this season’s updated vaccine.
Gov. Gavin Newsom and state health officials released the recommendations as part of the state’s newly formed health alliance with Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. Leading medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, informed the recommendations, according to the state’s announcement. Simultaneously, Newsom signed Assembly Bill 144, which among several things, requires insurance plans to cover the vaccines the state endorses.
“We are here to protect our communities,” Dr. Erica Pan, director of the California Department of Public Health, told CalMatters. “Many of us have dedicated our lives to doing that. We feel really strongly and want to show our unity” as medical, scientific and public health experts.
Pharmacies across the country started dispensing the vaccine in recent weeks, but anecdotes and news reports reveal a patchwork of access, with some people having no difficulty getting the shot, while others still unable to get it. 
Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of an updated COVID-19 vaccine but only for seniors and for people ages 5 to 64 who have an underlying condition that puts them at high risk for complications from a COVID-19 infection. This is more restrictive than in previous years, when the federal drug agency approved the vaccine for nearly everyone. Leading medical groups and some states immediately pushed back on the agency’s decision. 
California’s guidance comes just two days ahead of a key meeting where a federal vaccine panel will review the updated COVID-19 vaccine. Public health experts anticipate this panel will restrict access to the vaccine. 
That’s because U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. who is, known for anti-vaccine activism, in June dismissed all 17 members of this panel known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. He replaced them with 12 new members, some of whom are documented vaccine skeptics. 
Typically, after the FDA approves a vaccine for use, this federal committee makes recommendations on who should be immunized. In the past, insurers have based their vaccine coverage on the guidelines issued by this group. 
Pan said California’s actions are necessary because the committee’s credibility has been “compromised”. Now with the state’s separate guidance, the CDC group’s recommendations will carry no weight for Californians.
“Whatever comes out of [this committee], our new law is independent of that,” Pan said. 
Easier access under state rules 
The new law accompanying the state’s independent guidance ensures that most Californians will be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine, including young children, pregnant people and those without underlying medical conditions, said Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Law San Francisco and an expert on vaccine law. That’s in part because it allows pharmacists to independently prescribe and administer the shot so long as the state health department recommends it. 
Many people rely on pharmacies for seasonal vaccines like the flu shot and COVID-19 booster, Reiss said. Now if somebody who does not meet the more narrow federal guidelines goes to a CVS or Walgreens they won’t need a separate doctor’s prescription.
The law also grants the state health department broad authority over other vaccine policies. Many of the state’s immunization laws, including school vaccine schedules, insurance requirements and prescriber authorization, had also been tied to recommendations made by the CDC advisory committee. The state health department’s recommendations now take precedence.
Under these new policies, the department will be able to respond to future threats to vaccine availability and access, Pan said.
“We do anticipate there may be other issues that we would like to be unified on again,” she added.
It also comes amid reports that Kennedy intends to change the childhood vaccine schedule.
Pan said California and the other states in the alliance will base immunization recommendations on the work done by “trusted medical groups” that have independently assessed vaccine safety for years. 
Insurers to cover state-endorsed vaccines
Most Californians have insurance through state-regulated health plans, which now must cover the updated COVID-19 shot without copays. The new law also requires Medi-Cal, the state run insurance program for low-income residents and people with disabilities, to cover the COVID-19 shot and other vaccines recommended by the state health department.
Mary Ellen Grant, a spokesperson for the California Association of Health Plans, said the state’s policy changes “will greatly reduce the amount of confusion” among patients and ensure they have access to vaccinations. 
About 5.4 million Californians have insurance that is subject to federal regulations rather than state ones. Generally, these are people who work for large, multi-state or multinational companies. Nationally, insurers have been hesitant to make statements about vaccine coverage ahead of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, leaving coverage for people with federally regulated plans uncertain.
Still, Reiss said, she expects insurers to continue covering vaccines regardless of future changes made by the CDC’s advisory committee. It’s much cheaper for insurers to pay for vaccines than it is for them to pay for treatment of the diseases they prevent. 
The state’s partnership with Hawaii, Oregon and Washington also creates market pressure on insurers to continue vaccine coverage, Reiss said. 
“They might just say, ‘This is a big chunk of the population. We might as well have the same policy for all the country,’” she added.
Vaccines continue to be key protection
The rollout of this year’s vaccine is coinciding with a moderate surge in COVID-19 infections. Data from the California Department of Public Health show that cases have been ticking up since July. As of Sept. 6, 11.72% of samples sent in for testing were positive, slightly higher than this time last year.
Public health officials say the best way to stay healthy this fall and winter is to get vaccinated.
In addition to the COVID-19 vaccine, California’s immunization guidance also recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot. The vaccine to protect against Respiratory Syncytial Virus, or RSV, is recommended for all babies younger than 8 months and for babies between 8 months and 19 months if they carry risk factors. The RSV vaccine is also recommended for pregnant women at 32 weeks to 36 weeks of gestation and for all seniors 75 and older, as well as for those ages 50 to 74 with comorbidities. 
“If we want to make America healthy, rather than treating disease, we want to prevent disease, and well, vaccination is one of the best creations to prevent disease,” said. Dr. Jeffrey Silvers, an infectious disease specialist at Sutter Health. “It’s right up there with clean water in terms of preventing disease.”

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)WATFORD CITY, N.D. – North Dakota oil and gas companies have new economic allies in the form of a tech industry “desperate” to find energy sources to fuel the growth of artificial intelligence, Gov. Kelly Armstrong said Wednesday.
The governor, asked during the North Dakota Petroleum Council’s annual meeting about the value of artificial intelligence to the state, said “it is changing the dynamic” in a way that isn’t often discussed. 
The demand for artificial intelligence, generated in energy-intensive data centers, is surging from technology giants and countries around the globe. That is turning employees of tech companies, whom Armstrong called the “traditional adversaries” of places like North Dakota, into customers for natural gas.

“People who hated natural gas not that long ago, like 36 months ago, have all of a sudden recognized that natural gas is the key to the survival of their company,” Armstrong said.
That demand for power generation aligns with North Dakota’s need to find markets for its natural gas, a byproduct of crude oil production. 
“We’re going to see new synergies,” Armstrong said, “between Silicon Valley tech companies and western North Dakota oil companies.”
WBI to receive $500M state financial guarantee to build natural gas pipeline in North Dakota

Artificial intelligence companies may be the exact consumers North Dakota has been looking for to take care of the state’s excess supply of natural gas. WBI Energy is developing a natural gas pipeline from northwest North Dakota to the eastern part of the state with the help of an up to $500 million financial backstop awarded by the state. WBI said in application materials for the funding that some potential customers for the natural gas are developing power generation to support data centers.
North Dakota is an attractive place for data centers because the climate allows companies to lower their cooling costs.
“Being cold and windy is not usually a selling point,” Armstrong said. 
Enhanced oil recovery
North Dakota’s oil production, meanwhile, is expected to decline in the upcoming decades. But that’s not because the oil is running out. Oil companies can only extract a fraction of the crude oil underground before the reservoir, the pool of oil, loses pressure and wells become unproductive. 
The industry has been testing enhanced oil recovery methods to repressurize the underground reservoirs and continue pumping oil. The next few years will be crucial to advancing the technology, said John Harju of the Energy and Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota.
One enhanced oil recovery method involves injecting carbon dioxide underground. But North Dakota doesn’t produce enough carbon dioxide to fill the needs of the oil field. The proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline to bring CO2 from surrounding states has met significant opposition, raising concerns about the industry’s ability to obtain and transport enough CO2 for the Bakken. 
Natural gas could serve as a replacement, Harju said. 
“We feel very confident that performance with rich gas is going to be an outstanding proxy for CO2,” he said.

North Dakota has seen some opposition to energy-related projects in recent years. Rep. Craig Headland, R-Montpelier, said it is increasingly difficult to obtain easements for pipelines and other infrastructure necessary to continue energy development. 
“The public good doesn’t seem to matter like it used to,” Headland said during a lawmaker panel.
Sen. Mark Enget, R-Powers Lake, said he’s had many discussions with North Dakotans concerned about their property rights. Some of the problem, he said, is how companies approach landowners during a project’s development. 
“The people I’ve talked to all understand that progress is necessary. They’re not against it,” Enget said. “North Dakota people are very reasonable. If you talk to them respectfully and you work towards a solution and discuss it in a way that resonates and makes sense to them, there’s a way through it.”
Burke County, where Enget is from, has welcomed a recent growth in oil and gas activity, but it has come with challenges, he said. School overcrowding is an issue. Roads and other infrastructure are experiencing wear and tear. And, more recently, he’s grown concerned about the use of water resources for hydraulic fracturing.
“It creates a problem where many of our water resources in the county are really being drawn down,” Enget said. “So I worry about the longer term and if we see more and more activity, where all of that water is going to come from.”
Infrastructure projects, property rights and a way to reconcile the conflicts between them will continue to be an issue in the state, said Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston. 
“I think it’s going to loom large in the next session,” Bekkedahl said.

(Photo by Micah Drew)MISSOULA — “What do you want me to do?” U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen asked the legal team behind 22 youth suing the Trump administration over a series of actions aimed at “unleashing” the fossil fuel industry. 
The lawsuit, Lighthiser v. Trump, was filed in Montana’s federal district court in May and seeks to overturn a series of executive orders the youth argue will make climate change — and related crises such as extreme wildfires — worse.
The federal government, joined by a coalition of 19 states and territories led by Montana, seek the case’s dismissal. 
But Christensen, during a hearing Wednesday in Missoula’s federal courthouse, seemed skeptical of the remedy as he quizzed a lawyer for the youth about rolling back the three executive orders. 
The lawsuit seeks to overturn Trump Executive Orders 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” 14156, “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” and 14261, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” but the ask appears to be anything but simple. 
Over the last seven months, federal agencies have rescinded funding from climate science initiatives, pushed to open more land to oil and gas leasing, and halted renewable energy projects. Some of the actions have directly cited their compliance with the executive orders, while others align with the new administration’s policy agenda more broadly. 
“If I enjoin these orders, and these defendants enact policies favoring fossil fuels regardless of my enjoining the executive orders, what do I do then?” Christensen asked Julia Olsen, lead counsel for the plaintiffs on the second day of hearings. “Many things done by these agencies … appear to be derived from or based on these orders. … Do you want me to enjoin these agency actions as well?”
Olsen said the goal was to revert the country to a “status quo” that existed on January 19, the day before Trump signed the three orders. 
“The entire body of conduct should be enjoined,” she said. “Because it’s unconstitutional a … and is causing irreparable harm to these plaintiffs.”
Christensen appeared skeptical of that plan, which he said could amount to him having to review every energy-related policy and action taken by numerous government agencies “until the expiration of our collective lifetimes.” 
Attorneys for the federal and state governments agreed, saying the court was essentially being asked to set national energy policy — a clear overreach. 
“It’s unprecedented,” federal attorney Michael Sawyer said. “There is no basis in law for stepping in and going back to January 19th.”
In addition, he said an injunction would “irreparably harm” the United States and essentially force the district court into overseeing the actions of at least 13 federal agencies, with the plaintiffs’ lawyers returning to court every time they dispute an energy permit or federal rule. 
“They basically get to become the masters of the court’s injunction,” Sawyer said. 
Sawyer argued the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the lawsuit, in part because there is no meaningful action the court can take to immediately offer relief to the alleged harms related to climate change, including wildfire smoke and extreme weather events like heat waves.
He also said challenging such a broad, sweeping policy order was the incorrect way to seek a change. Instead, he said the plaintiffs should challenge actual agency actions, such as a permitting decision over coal lease or a change to a specific rule. 
“This is thousands of lawsuits packed into one,” Sawyer said. “There’s been hundreds of different permitting decisions by the Department of the Interior — they want the court to jump in and issue one ruling to stop them all.”
Sawyer sought to tie the Lighthiser arguments to another youth-led climate lawsuit, Juliana v. United States. That case was ultimately dismissed by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals after years of litigation due to a lack of standing issue. 
But Olsen argued they were fundamentally different, because the current case is not asking the government to address decades of actions with a plan of action, but merely stop three executive orders. 
 ‘A constant reminder of the climate crisis’

Over the two-day hearing, the court heard from five youth plaintiffs and a series of expert witnesses who spoke about climate science, energy policy and the health effects of climate change. The government didn’t call any witnesses.
Isaiah Hudson, a high school senior from Missoula, was the only plaintiff to take the stand on Wednesday, where he shared his love of the outdoors and of running. 
As a varsity cross country runner for his high school, Hudson said summer months are a key time to build fitness for the fall season. 
But when wildfires burning across the west fill the Missoula valley with smoke, he’s had to miss days, and even weeks, of training. 
“I can’t exercise. I can’t go outside as often, and that impacts my mental health a lot,” Hudson said. “And it’s a constant reminder of the climate crisis we’re facing.”
Lori Byron, a retired pediatrician, testified about the increased harm children face from environmental factors exacerbated by climate change including from extreme heat and breathing particulate matter with still-developing lungs.
“Adding just one part per billion of pollution into the air mixture increases the risk of mortality,” she said. “…There are grave risks to these plaintiffs and other children by the concept of unleashing more fossil fuels.”
The court also heard from Nicole Hughes, the executive director of a renewable energy nonprofit who talked about the number of wind energy programs that had been halted after Trump took office, including the Lava Ridge Wind project in Idaho, stopped in one of the executive orders. 
The government lawyers pushed back against some of Hughes’ testimony by pointing out that wind — and solar — energy are not mentioned in any of the three challenged orders, and Trump had issued an entirely separate memorandum on wind energy, which the plaintiffs aren’t trying to overturn. 
That memo has been challenged in a Massachusetts court, and Sawyer said the Lighthiser plaintiffs “had every opportunity to go to that court and be part of that litigation.”
Instead, he said, they’re trying to assert their own policy preferences over every energy-related proposal by the administration. 
A last witness called by the plaintiffs laid the groundwork that Trump’s orders to bolster the fossil fuel industry had no economic justification, as renewable sources such as solar and wind are cheaper than fossil fuels such as coal. 
Geoffrey Heal, a professor emeritus at Columbia University in business and international and public affairs, said it was “baffling” to say the executive orders would strengthen trade and national security, as Trump and his lawyers argued, and that America was not in the midst of an energy emergency. 
He compared the current state of affairs, where the county is relatively energy sufficient, with the 1970s, when wars in the middle east led to an oil shortage. 
“There were gas stations with no gasoline, airports with no jet fuel, fights were breaking out,” Heal said. “That, unambiguously, amounted to an energy emergency.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Members of the Iowa Board of Regents on Wednesday recommended approval for the group that will advise the University of Iowa’s new center for intellectual freedom, despite concerns over the political and geographical spread of the proposed group.
At Wednesday’s board meeting, regent Christine Hensley, who will chair the advisory board, updated the board on the center’s progress. Legislation passed in the spring mandated the formation of the center, placing it under the purview of the Iowa Board of Regents.
Board President Sherry Bates said during discussion of the center that with advisory board members and an interim director identified, the center can begin its work.
“Civic education is a priority for this board,” Bates said. “We believe in civil and free inquiry, and are hopeful that with the establishment of this center at University of Iowa, as well as similar initiatives at ISU and UNII, the flow of individual ideas and opinions will continue to flourish.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While the law states the advisory council must include at least nine members, the list recommended for approval includes 26 names set to serve either two- or four-year terms. It is currently unknown whether all of the members will have voting abilities or not, but Hensley said during the meeting the “intent” is to have the entire board vote.
Regents Robert Cramer and Kurt Tjaden will join Hensley in serving four-year terms on the advisory council, according to board documents, and Jim Lindenmayer and Mike Richards, both former regents, will serve for two years. Peter Matthes, UI vice president for external relations and senior advisor to the president, will be the sole representation for the university on the advisory council and serve a four-year term.
Former Iowa state senator Liz Mathis would serve a four-year term on the advisory council, joined by University of Austin President Carlos Carvalho, Fareway CEO Reynolds Cramer, Iowans for Tax Relief Foundation Policy Director John Hendrickson and other economists and academics.
Ambassador and former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad and former U.S. House member Greg Ganske would serve two-year terms alongside faculty and corporate executives from across the U.S.
Hensley emphasized during the meeting that the proposed advisory council membership is politically balanced, with 12 members identifying as independent, 11 Republicans and three Democrats. Gov. Kim Reynolds and her office worked with Hensley to recruit people for the council, she said, and tapped Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to identify leaders in the development of similar centers in the state.
According to data compiled by the Independent Voter Project, Iowa’s voting base is split in near-thirds, with approximately 37% Republicans, 34% unaffiliated and 28% Democrats as of Aug. 27. On the advisory board, Democrats would make up just over 11% of the group, Republicans would make up around 42% and independents would fill the rest.
Regent Nancy Dunkel was the only board member to ask questions about those nominated to the advisory board and cast the sole “no” vote on the list of names recommended for board approval.
In addition to her issues with the minority of women on the council and the political breakdown of its potential members, one of Dunkel’s biggest concerns was that half of the individuals are not residents of Iowa. That will dilute Iowans’ votes and voice in the center, she said, adding that many of the individuals are unknown to the majority of the regents beyond their reputation.
“I can see that you want to go get advice from groups of people, but to actually name them to an advisory committee is baffling to me,” Dunkel said.
Olivia Jones, a University of Iowa graduate worker and member of the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students, also expressed her concern with the makeup of the advisory council members during public comment Wednesday.
Citing research she conducted and sent to the board, Jones said 22 of the 26 proposed advisory board members are either Republicans, donors to Republican campaigns or involved with conservative think tanks, agreeing with Dunkel’s comments about the group’s political balance.
The center’s interim director, UI professor Luciano de Castro, has stated that most UI instructors are left-leaning without providing any information to back the claim up, Jones said, and has an outsized amount of power in hiring and other planning efforts. Hensley said during the meeting a national search will take place to identify the official director.
While Regent David Barker pointed out that a Google search shows the candidates’ work and credentials that qualify them for the council, Dunkel said the group should slow down and think more about who they are and what they could bring to the center.
With the legislation mandating that only one member of the advisory board can come from the UI, Hensley said she and others involved in filling the board saw an opportunity to look outside Iowa’s borders to find the best people.
“I don’t think it’s important at this point that we have to know them personally, but their records speak volumes for them, and if we really want to make this an example of a center that’s going to be successful, we have to look at those individuals outside the area,” Hensley said.
Board of Regents Counsel Aimee Claeys said during the meeting “detailed conversations” about council policies and procedures have not been conducted yet, and Hensley said she was unsure of whether out-of-state members would be reimbursed or provided funds for travel and other expenses when coming to Iowa. Dunkel said board of regents members are not paid in any way for their travel or anything else, and her expectation is that the council will be treated the same.
Dunkel introduced a motion to table the decision until some of this information can be parsed out, but it failed to receive a second. Board President Sherry Bates said during the meeting that many of Dunkel’s questions “need to be answered,” which she expects will happen through the process of creating bylaws and other work.
Barker thanked Hensley for her efforts in preparing for the launch of the center — an idea he said he’s been “pushing for” since he was appointed to the board six years ago.
“I’m really excited to see it happen, and I think it’s going to be a center that will receive national recognition, a national reputation, and help boost the University of Iowa,” Barker said.

Elk Mountain Ranch owner’s petition for review of his failed trespassing suit is “procedurally deficient and doctrinally unfounded,” attorneys in public-access case contend.
The post Supreme Court shouldn’t take up Wyoming corner-crossing appeal, hunters say appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. Supreme Court should not review the Elk Mountain Ranch owner’s failed trespass lawsuit against four men who corner crossed to hunt on public land in Carbon County, the hunters’ lawyers say in a 39-page document filed Wednesday.
Ranch owner Fred Eshelman’s petition to the high court to take up the case is “procedurally deficient and doctrinally unfounded,” the new filing states. Eshelman’s claim that corner crossing is an unconstitutional taking of private property was not fully and fairly presented to lower courts and is therefore moot, the hunters contend.
Eshelman asserts, among other things, that corner crossing is an unconstitutional taking of private property without compensation. But he and his landowning company Iron Bar Holdings raised that argument late in the legal process, and almost in passing, the hunters say.
For the Supreme Court to consider Eshelman’s takings argument, the ranch owner had to first fully argue the issue in the lower courts, thereby exhausting all his other remedies, according to the hunters’ brief.
“This Court should not take this case to explore Iron Bar’s procedurally deficient and doctrinally unfounded takings theory,” attorneys Ryan Semerad and Lee Mickus wrote.
“Been here before”
Eshelman’s Elk Mountain Ranch covers some 20,000 acres of a wildlife-rich peak that soars to 11,156 feet. The North Carolina owner and pharmaceutical magnate is a hunter whose property surrounds 6,000 acres or more of public land owned by all Americans and controlled by the Bureau of Land Management.
Across southern Wyoming, property ownership is laid out in a checkerboard pattern of public and private square-mile sections, a vestige of the railroad building and land-grant era of the mid 1800s.
“Iron Bar complains that this narrow decision effectively legalized trespassing across the country, destroying billions of dollars in property value. The hyperbole is misplaced.” Ryan Semerad and Lee Mickus
“Many public-land squares on these checkerboards are accessible only by ‘corner crossing,’” the hunters’ attorneys explain. That is by “stepping from one public-land square to the next one across the public-private corner without touching the private-land squares.”
To corner cross, one must inevitably pass through the airspace above private property. Based on the common-law “ad coelum” dictum that presumes a landowner also owns the airspace above his or her property, Eshelman contends corner crossing is a trespass.
The onX digital mapping company estimated that 8.3 million acres of public land in the West would be inaccessible to the public if corner crossing is found to be an illegal trespass.
That’s what Missouri hunters Bradly Cape, John Slowensky and Phillip Yeomans did in 2020, and with Zachary Smith again in 2021. The Carbon County attorney cited them for trespass and a jury found them not guilty of the misdemeanor in 2022.
Eshelman sued the four in civil court that year, seeking to bar them and others from corner crossing to reach public land on Elk Mountain. A federal judge in Wyoming decided that Eshelman could not block the hunters from landlocked public land in the checkerboard part of Wyoming and the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed when Eshelman took his case to that venue.
The Wyoming chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers has backed the hunters, saying they needed to have their case heard and required financial support to balance Eshelman’s wealth and resources.
Eshelman’s petition to the Supreme Court said the 10th Circuit decision against him “steamrolls state law, takes easements, and revolutionizes property law affecting up to 150 million acres of private land.”
Disarming Eshelman’s takings arguments was one of several points the hunters made in their response, including that “this [Supreme] court has been here before” and decided in favor of public access to public land. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals correctly applied the text of the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act and the precedent set by other cases that revolved around that law, the hunters say.

Congress passed the 1885 act during checkerboard scuffles to prohibit blocking public access to public land, including by using fences, other physical barriers and even threats and intimidation.
The appeals court’s decision is narrow, doesn’t break new ground and is not in conflict with decisions in other appeals court circuits, the hunters’ response states. Those are all reasons to let the lower court ruling stand, they say.
Eshelman also failed to fully argue in lower courts that the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act does not automatically supersede Wyoming’s trespass laws. “Ordinarily, this [Supreme] Court does not decide questions not raised or resolved in the lower court,” the hunters state.
Bye bye Leo Sheep
Eshelman and his landowning company Iron Bar Holdings have argued that courts decided another Carbon County checkerboard case — known as Leo Sheep — in favor of blocking public access to public land across checkboard corners. In that instance, the BLM sought to build a road across a common corner to provide public access to a reservoir.

Fredric N. Eshelman is the owner of Iron Bar Holdings LLC, a New Hanover County, North Carolina, company, according to a 2005 filing with the Wyoming Secretary of State’s office. A web page for Eshelman Ventures displays the above photo of Eshelman and states that he served as CEO and executive chairman of Pharmaceutical Product Development before the company was sold to private equity interests.

Courts ruled against the BLM. Eshelman’s attorneys use that decision to argue that the federal government never reserved an easement allowing the public to corner cross.
The hunters disagree.
“As the Tenth Circuit explained, Leo Sheep doesn’t apply to Iron Bar’s claims,” the hunters say. The Supreme Court has already said that the 1885 act, on which the hunters hang their hats, “played no role” in Leo Sheep, Wednesday’s filing states.
“But Iron Bar raises a categorically different question,” the hunters continue, “whether checkerboard landowners can affirmatively extinguish all access to neighboring checkerboarded public land.” The Supreme Court rejected a petition to review a case that “invoked Leo Sheep in the same flawed way,” the hunters say.
The hunters’ response elaborates on a couple of other points, emphasizing the effects of finding that corner crossing is an illegal trespass.
“The UIA supplants conflicting state law since a different rule would place the public domain of the United States completely at the mercy of state legislation,” the filing states. In other words, by blocking the public from public property, Eshelman can enjoy that public land and its bounty for himself, the hunters say.
Semerad and Mickus note that the 1885 UIA was in effect ages before Eshelman ever laid eyes on Elk Mountain.
“Iron Bar bought checkerboarded property in 2005,” the attorneys wrote. “[Eshelman’s] rights have always been subject to the limits imposed by the UIA.”
Although the 10th Circuit decision is focused, the hunters say Eshelman exaggerates its effects.
“Iron Bar complains that this narrow decision effectively legalized trespassing across the country, destroying billions of dollars in property value,” the filing reads. “The hyperbole is misplaced.”
“The [appeals] court did not immunize a trespasser who marches straight down the middle of private property,” as Eshelman contends, the hunters say. “Rather, the court held only that if access to public lands is otherwise restricted, a checkerboard landowner cannot sue a corner crosser for trespassing so long as they did not physically touch [private] land.”

A lawsuit Disability Rights NC brought against the state Department of Health and Human Services carries her name. (Photo courtesy Disability Rights NC)The state Department of Health and Human Services has shown some progress in meeting court-ordered deadlines to make sure community services are available to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities, but an advocacy group questions what the state data can prove. 
The court order is the result of a lawsuit called Samantha R., brought by Disability Rights NC against DHHS on behalf of people who were institutionalized or faced institutionalization. The lawsuit claimed the state was not doing enough to support people with disabilities who want to live in their communities; it was named for Samantha Rhoney who spent seven years in a state facility because her parents no longer had the support to keep her at home. 
Disability Rights won in trial court, with the judge issuing an order that would have given the state 10 years to eliminate the waiting list of people seeking services under a Medicaid program called the Innovations Waiver.  
DHHS appealed but later dropped the appeal and the two sides agreed to a consent order that set out goals aimed at keeping people out of institutions and increasing use of community-support services.  The consent order dropped the required elimination of the waiting list. 
More than 16,000 people were on the waiting list in late 2022. It’s grown to 18,950 people as of March 31 of this year. 
“We’re all watching in horror as the numbers continue to go up,” said Lisa Grafstein, a lawyer with Disability Rights who is also a state senator from Raleigh. 
Disability Rights hosted an update on the Samantha R. case on Wednesday and will host another Thursday evening. 
According to the state’s latest report, DHHS has exceeded the first-year court-ordered goal of moving people out of institutions by increasing access to community services. Under the court order, at least 78 people should have moved from institutions by June 30 of this year. DHHS reported that 97 people had moved by March 31. 
Based on the knowledge that some people are approved for community services that they don’t receive, the court ordered that by June of this year 85% of authorized services should be used. DHHS reported that 85.2% were being used. 
“The data is not an end in itself,” Grafstein said. “It’s part of this longer term process of getting the state into compliance with rights of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and that means providing access to services in the community for those who want it, most prominently eliminating the waiting list.”
DHHS reported that more than 11,000 people with intellectual or developmental disabilities received services through a different Medicaid program. But that program has limited services and limited hours, said Emma Kinyanjui, Disability Rights’ legal director. It’s unclear what kinds of help people are receiving and how far it’s going to meet their needs, she said. 
There aren’t enough people who do the low-paid, community-based work, which is one of the reasons people wait for services. 
As a form of professional development, the state established an advanced training certificate program for the workers, called direct support professionals, that’s offered at three community colleges. Additionally, DHHS offered $3 million to provider agencies to pay hiring and retention bonuses. 
Next summer, DHHS and Disability Rights are going to review the data the state has collected and talk about next steps, said Corye Dunn, Disability Rights’ public policy director. The two sides may agree on what to do next, she said. But if the state moves to dismiss the case, Disability Rights would oppose it, she said. 
“Our hope is that we can all agree that more needs to be done, especially around the waiting lists and DPS (Direct Support Professionals) pay,” Dunn said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Samantha-on-sofa-in-her-home-scaled-1.webp,,,2025-09-17 19:57:22.783885

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in the state Capitol. Raffensperger announced Wednesday that he will run for Georgia governor in 2026. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger officially launched his long-expected campaign for governor Wednesday with a video announcement touting his conservative bona fides.
“I’m a conservative Republican, and I’m prepared to make the tough decisions,” he said. “I follow the law and the Constitution, and I’ll always do the right thing for Georgia, no matter what.”
Raffensperger became a household name after the 2020 election when President Donald Trump called on him to “find 11,780 votes” and help overturn his loss in the state.
Raffensperger refused, and elements of the GOP have been hostile to him ever since – delegates at this year’s state GOP convention passed a resolution barring him from running as a Republican, though they acknowledge they do not actually have the power to do so.
The only mention of the president in Raffensperger’s announcement was a pledge to work with Trump and Congress “to bring jobs back to Georgia, deport criminal aliens, and restore law and order in communities across the state.”
If Raffensperger’s popularity took a hit among Republicans after 2020, it wasn’t enough to stop him from winning re-election in 2022 by comfortable margins against a Trump-backed opponent in the primary and a potent Democratic challenger in the general.
He will face stiff competition again next year as a slew of candidates from both parties seek to replace Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who is not running again because of term limits.
GOP voters in May’s primary election will select between Raffensperger and other big names including Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and Attorney General Chris Carr.
In a statement on social media, Jones touted his Trump endorsement.
“Chris Carr and Brad Raffensperger have one thing in common: They are both Never Trumpers,” he said. “There is only one candidate in this race that’s always supported and has the full and complete endorsement of @realDonaldTrump.”
Carr spokesperson Julia Mazzone called Carr the most electable candidate.
“We welcome anyone to this race, but the reality is Chris Carr is the only candidate who can win both the primary and the general election,” she said. “Chris Carr is also the only candidate who understands the challenges real Georgians face in making ends meet and building a better future.”
The winner of the Republican primary will go on to face the Democratic candidate next November. The names on the Democratic primary ballot are set to include Atlanta state Sen. Jason Esteves, former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond and former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan.
Democrats are hoping the GOP candidates’ connections to Trump will damage their nominee’s prospects in a general election.
“As he wades into the governor’s race, Brad Raffensperger will have to pay the price of admission to any 2026 GOP primary: fully embracing Donald Trump and his toxic agenda of sky-high costs, shuttered hospitals, health care cuts, and economic chaos,” said Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey in a statement. “We’ll see if Raffensperger can successfully out-MAGA Burt Jones and Chris Carr to win this messy, bruising primary – good luck!”

“Whatever label is used — a war crime, or crimes against humanity, or ethnic cleansing, or genocide — one thing is clear. This must end,” U.S. Sen. Peter Welch said on the Senate floor Wednesday.

The three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation on Wednesday, for the first time publicly, called Israel’s military campaign in Gaza a genocide, according to their offices.
U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., used the term in an op-ed she published Wednesday about the Middle East conflict on the news website Courier. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., published a statement on his website Wednesday bluntly titled, “It Is Genocide.” U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., used the word in a Senate floor speech Wednesday.
The delegation’s statements come a day after an independent United Nations commission released a report finding that Israel has committed four “genocidal acts” since Hamas’ brutal attack on the country on Oct. 7, 2023. This week, Israel also launched a long-threatened ground assault on the major population center Gaza City. 
According to Balint’s office, the second-term representative is the first Jewish member of the U.S. House to describe Israel’s offensive — which is estimated to have killed more than 65,000 people since the 2023 attack — as a genocide.
Balint wrote that “it is not easy” for her to call Israel’s actions a genocide, because her grandfather was murdred in the Holocaust and she has “an emotional connection to Israel beacuse it was a refuge after the genocide against the Jews.”
However, she continued, “the trauma of the Holocaust serves as a reminder of the power of speaking out. I feel compelled to speak out because I know there are so many others like me who are horrified by what they see.”
Sanders, in a separate statement Wednesday, also referred to the UN report. The commission’s findings have been strongly condemned by Israel’s government.
“I recognize that many people may disagree with this conclusion,” Sanders said of his decision to use the word “genocide.” “The truth is, whether you call it genocide or ethnic cleansing or mass atrocities or war crimes, the path forward is clear. We, as Americans, must end our complicity in the slaughter of the Palestinian people.”
Welch spoke on the Senate floor about the conflict ahead of a vote on a resolution he was leading that called for food and humanitarian aid delivery to starving children in Gaza. The measure, which was sponsored by more than 40 other Democratic senators, was not approved.
“There are many labels that could apply to what is happening in Gaza today. And whatever label is used — a war crime, or crimes against humanity, or ethnic cleansing, or genocide — one thing is clear. This must end,” Welch said. “It’s not just about giving a name or a label. It is about saving lives.”

The Crawford parade begins at 10 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 27, at 19th and Farnam Streets and finishes at 10th and Harney Streets, with a celebratory program to follow on the Heartland of America Park stage.
It is the city’s recognition of Crawford’s Sept. 13 defeat of Canelo Alvarez in Las Vegas, one of the biggest fights in the modern era. The unanimous decision made Crawford super middleweight champion and first male boxer to be the undisputed champion in three weight classes. 
Ewing during the press conference also announced a series of mayoral town halls to talk about Omaha’s future: Oct. 16, Salvation Army Kroc Center, 2825 Y St., Oct. 20, Learning Community Center of North Omaha, 1612 N. 24th St., Oct. 22, Montclair Community Center, 2304 S. 135th Ave., Oct. 27, Saddlebrook Community Center, 14850 Laurel Ave.
The town halls run from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Among accomplishments Ewing noted in his first 100 days of becoming Omaha’s 52nd mayor were a $40 million commitment to affordable housing development via streetcar bond revenue and his presentation of a 2026 city budget with no increase to the city’s portion of the tax levy.
“Coming in the door with 43 years of public service prepared me well for the duties of leading this dynamic, wonderful city,” said Ewing, a former Omaha Police Department deputy chief who was elected in 2006 to his first term as Douglas County Treasurer. He is Omaha’s first elected Black mayor.

While Vermonters look for ways to lower their energy costs, access to plug-in and portable solar panels could lower bills and carbon emissions, according to a new campaign launched in Montpelier on Wednesday. 
Balcony solar, or miniature panels that can be set up on a patio or lawn, have gained popularity across Europe, and now Vermont is angling to become the second state to duplicate such a program. Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington, chair of the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee, plans to introduce a bill during the 2026 legislative session to make plug-in solar panels available to Vermonters who can’t install a traditional net metering system, she said at a press conference. 
“My goal is to make it as easy as possible for people to purchase and plug in one of these devices and start saving money, while also getting the electric utilities the information that they need to meet their own requirements,” Watson said. 
The bill would propose removing current requirements like interconnection agreements with utilities and registration, as is currently required with solar installations 10 times as large, Watson said. Residents would only need to notify their electric companies that they had such a system under her bill, Watson said. 
“Seeing Utah pass a bill like this unanimously, and in a bipartisan way, that support underscored how doable I think this bill is going to be,” Watson said. “It’s time for us to get out of the way, cut that red tape, and make it easy for Vermonters to access affordable solar.”
Such a project could make renewable energy more available to all Vermonters, according to Ben Edgerly Walsh, a lobbyist for the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, a state-based environmental advocacy group. While 20,000 Vermont families have benefitted from household solar through the state’s net metering program, Walsh said, hundreds of thousands have been left out, including those who rent or live in condos or mobile homes.

“One part of the solar market hardest to open up is renters, and people who can’t afford to have solar on their property,” Walsh said Monday. 
But these smaller units, capped at 1.2 kilowatts under the proposed legislation, can be plugged into a normal wall outlet where electrons can start flowing into the house, helping to power appliances and energize light switches. They can also be connected to a battery that can save the energy for when it’s needed. Walsh estimated it could power about a fifth of a typical household, or save about $20 on a $100 electric bill. 
The small systems are also more affordable because they don’t require the same installation costs and the logistics of connecting to the grid. One unit could cost Vermonters $1,500 to $2,000, Walsh estimated, which could be paid back in about three years before adding free power to a household for the life of the system. 
In Germany, these systems now help power at least 1 million households, but those estimates could be three times as high, according to reporting by The New York Times. Rupert Mayer, a co-founder of Bright Saver, a California-based nonprofit partner that helps states and individuals set up plug-in solar systems, indicated at Wednesday’s press conference that there are 4 million portable solar units.
The portable  solar panels also enabled freedom and independence in one’s backyard without government interference, Mayer said. He said Bright Saver was talking to lawmakers across blue and red states to advance portable solar and help consumers experience its benefits. 

“It should be fairly non-controversial,” Walsh said of the initiative. “It just requires cutting a little red tape in a few places to make it possible.”
While such a move isn’t as precedent-setting as Vermont’s Climate Superfund Act or its attempt at a Clean Heat Standard, the state could be among the first to support balcony solar. 
In Utah, a bipartisan bill passed unanimously this year to reduce restrictions and expand access to this small-scale, affordable solar option. Utah Republican Gov. Spencer J. Cox signed the bill into law in March. In August, Pennsylvania legislators also began considering such a bill to facilitate widespread deployment of balcony solar. 
But while Utah’s bill became a success story, Vermont could see pushback.

“The Trump administration, they’ve doubled down on fossil fuels and they’re really doing all they can to upend the clean energy job sector,” said Johanna Miller, the energy and climate program director at the Vermont Natural Resources Council. But Miller said the 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act says the state has an obligation and an opportunity to help Vermonters move away from the burning of fossil fuels, the largest contributor to climate change. 
“The sad truth is that climate and energy policy is one of the most polarized areas in a very polarized political environment,” Walsh said. But he added there are no subsidies for this program — the legislation only asked to make it easier to install these systems without requiring net metering or grid connection. 
“For all the climate policies you can imagine us working on, this one is certainly the best set up for bipartisan support,” Walsh said. 
Vermont recently lost a major solar investment when the federal government slashed $62.5 million the state was promised by the Solar For All program, following President Donald Trump signing his One Big Beautiful Bill in July. 
While such a small-scale program can’t replace the massive funding package, Walsh said it’s another good way for Vermonters who have had trouble accessing solar to get a piece of the clean energy transition for themselves.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)A federal appeals court will consider whether Idaho’s recent voting laws unconstitutionally target voters based on age. 
A three-judge panel heard oral arguments Wednesday in the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals courtroom in Seattle in a challenge led by the youth advocacy organization March For Our Lives Idaho. 
The organization, along with the Idaho Alliance for Retired Americans, sued Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane over House Bill 124 and House Bill 340 — legislation that passed in 2023 eliminating student identification as a valid form of ID for voter registration and at the polls. House Bill 340 created a new list of acceptable ways to prove identity and residency to register to vote and allowed the Idaho Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a no-cost voter photo ID. 
Attorney David Fox, arguing on behalf of March For Our Lives Idaho on Wednesday, said that laws were a “targeted strike on young voters.” 
He said the laws violate the 26th Amendment of the Constitution, which states that U.S. citizens who are 18 years or older cannot have their right to vote denied or abridged on the basis of age. 
Idaho Deputy Solicitor General Michael Zarian countered that the state is allowed to create reasonable restrictions on voting to ensure security, and that the laws in question “don’t place a special burden on anyone.” 
“Any student who would have used a student ID before is now simply in line with the rest of the electorate who has always had to go to the DMV and obtain a compliant identification,” Zarian said.

 March For Our Lives says bills were meant to discriminate against Idaho’s young voters 

Fox on Wednesday focused on the disparate impact on young voters, which he said was an intentional target by the Idaho Legislature. 
Judge William Fletcher questioned the attorney if motivation could be assumed from the effect. 
Fox pointed to the lawmakers’ comments when the bill was being proposed, and how they differed from another proposed bill that would have eliminated the signed affidavit as valid identification at the polls. 
“There were concerns raised about the impact on young people, and they were entirely disregarded by the Legislature,” Fox said. 
He argued that when the affidavit bill was discussed, lawmakers asked for an age breakdown of who used it and found elderly voters were the primary users of this option. 
“And so the fact that the Legislature was especially, specifically concerned about age, and then specifically declined to eliminate one form of identification after learning that it was used by elderly voters, and in doing so, said they were trying to protect elderly voters, while on the other hand, restricting student identification, that clearly is disparately used and disparately affects young voters is strong evidence of intent,” Fox said. 
 Idaho argues laws improves security, does not limit voting access 

Zarian, of the Idaho Attorney General’s Office, said the lawmakers were aware that some universities didn’t have certain documentation requirements to confirm identity before issuing student ID cards, and thus they were not adequate to prove ID when voting or registering. 
“Idaho has wanted to make its elections as secure as possible and wanted to foreclose any loophole that could possibly be used for fraud,” he said. 
Fletcher asked if there was evidence of a student ID being used for voter fraud. 
Zarian said the state hadn’t found any evidence of the IDs being used for fraud. 
He also said the law hasn’t affected many people. In an election in 2022, electronic voter rolls — which are used by most but not all counties in Idaho — recorded around 100 voters who used student IDs to vote. Zarian said that March For Our Lives has not adequately shown its members were significantly burdened by the new requirements.
“It’s a legal, even-handed requirement on all people,” Zarian said. 
He also said there’s no evidence there was an intention to limit voting access for young people. 
 Similar case previously dismissed by Idaho Supreme Court

Another youth-led advocacy group, BABE Vote, with the League of Women Voters of Idaho, brought a challenge in county district court; the case was dismissed in April 2024 by the Idaho Supreme Court, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
The court unanimously upheld the laws, writing that the Idaho Constitution allows the state Legislature to create “qualifications, limitations and conditions” on the right of suffrage. The court found that the laws do not discriminate against a specific group of people, and they are related to the government’s interest in preserving election integrity.
March For Our Lives brought a separate lawsuit to the federal court.
U.S. District Court Judge Amanda Brailsford in a September 2024 opinion upheld the law and dismissed the case. 
“The Secretary (of State) has shown House Bill 340 promotes the State’s important interests of
election security and prevention of voter fraud,” she wrote. “Balancing these interests
against House Bill 340’s requirement that registrants provide an approved form of identification
to register — which may include no-fee identification — the Court concludes House Bill 340 does not pose an unconstitutional burden on registrants …” 
Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said in a statement at the time that the Idaho Legislature “took important steps to provide secure elections while expanding accessibility to voting and eliminating burdens to participation.”
“These goals are not mutually exclusive,” the statement read. “We must promote uniformity and security in the identifications allowed for voter registration and voting.”

“The text, which is circulating in Arkansas and several other states, requests accurate account information so the state can deposit money,” a press release from the department said. “This is an effort to fraudulently access bank accounts.”
The texts may appear to be from a government agency but are “in no way legitimate,” the release said. People who receive them should not engage with them, it added.
“DFA urges all taxpayers to remain cautious, verify the source of any communication before taking action, and rely only on official state and federal websites for tax information and services,” the press release said.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The New Mexico Higher Education Department said Wednesday that the state’s colleges and universities have more than $1 billion in infrastructure needs.
In a news release, the department said officials traveled over 700 miles across the state for its annual summer hearings to assess infrastructure needs and requests  — called capital outlay — to bring to the Legislature in next year’s session.
Higher Education Secretary Stephanie Rodriguez and the agency’s Capital Projects Division hosted meetings with the Department of Finance and Administration; the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department; and the Legislative Finance Committee, according to the news release.
Using data from campus leaders, the department will recommend specific capital projects to the executive and legislative branches, who will then debate the funding during the budget-focused 30-day legislative session that begins in January.
Last year, HED recommended approximately $221 million in campus infrastructure projects to DFA and the LFC, the news release states. Lawmakers approved 25 projects totaling more than $44 million, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed two of those totaling $350,000, according to LFC documents.
Rodriguez’s final tour visits in August took place at the New Mexico School for the Deaf and the Institute of American Indian Arts. In an interview at the time, she told Source NM, she had previously visited New Mexico State University’s main campus in Las Cruces; the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell; Eastern New Mexico University-Roswell; and the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.
“Visiting all 33 campuses and schools in person has provided me with valuable insights we can’t get from reports alone,” Rodriguez said in a statement on Wednesday. “As the first higher education cabinet secretary to personally step foot on every public college, university and special school in the state, these visits have directly shaped the agency’s funding recommendations to support the unique needs of each school, strengthen student success and ensure that education in New Mexico continues to grow and thrive in state-of-the-art facilities.”

Larry Rhoden speaks to reporters during a press conference on March 31, 2025, at the state Capitol in Pierre. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Several South Dakota lawmakers expressed doubts Wednesday that Gov. Larry Rhoden would change any minds with his pledge to create a Correctional Rehabilitation Task Force “following the passage” of his prison construction plan next week.
“No. Not at all,” said House Assistant Majority Leader Marty Overweg, R-New Holland. “I think most people are pretty dug in right now.” 
A special session Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre will be the culmination of a years-long effort to replace the oldest parts of the Sioux Falls penitentiary, which predates statehood. 
After a proposal from Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem, to build in rural Lincoln County bogged down in local opposition, litigation and legislative concerns about the $825 million price tag, Rhoden appointed a Project Prison Reset task force to start over. 
Prison leader quits as prison vote looms

The group has since endorsed a new site on vacant land in northeast Sioux Falls and a lower price of $650 million for a 1,500-bed facility. The governor has said there’s enough money from the budget adopted last winter and a prison construction fund — which legislators have been filling for several years — to build the prison without debt.
Some opponents have expressed concerns that the state isn’t doing enough to keep people out of prison or prevent released inmates from reoffending.
In a news release Wednesday, Rhoden said if legislators approve the prison plan, “the next task is to expand our rehabilitative programming — that’s where this task force comes in.” 
The news release said the task force would assess programming needs for inmates, options for faith-based and Native American-focused programs, and best practices for re-entry models. It would also make recommendations on how to best use the expanded space of the new prison. 
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen would lead the group, but no names were provided for other members. The news release said the roster would include legislators from both parties and chambers, plus a cross-section of experts in behavioral health, addiction counseling, correctional rehabilitative services and a tribal representative.
Overweg said he has not decided how he will vote. He is unconvinced that prison construction contractors won’t return for more money later after the $650 million cap has been reached. 
Senate Majority Whip Kevin Jensen, R-Canton, is co-chairing a legislative task force on incarceration rates and recidivism this summer and has declared himself a “hard no” on the prison bill. He called Rhoden’s announcement overdue and poorly timed, making it appear like a play to garner more votes.
“I’m wondering if it might backfire,” Jensen said.

Jensen also called attention to the language in Rhoden’s press release, which said the task force would be created “following the passage and signing of the draft legislation for the new prison.” 
South Dakota Searchlight sought clarity from the governor’s office about whether the creation of the task force is contingent on the passage of the prison plan. Spokeswoman Josie Harms responded in writing: “The Correctional Rehabilitation Task Force will be established following the passage and signing of the draft legislation for the new prison. The new prison will significantly increase space for rehabilitative programming, warranting the need for this task force.” She did not immediately respond to follow-ups.
House Minority Whip Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, also serves on the summer task force. She said another task force making recommendations is not what the state needs.
“We have the data, we know what the problems are,” she said.
Wittman declined to say how she will vote on the prison proposal but stressed the poor condition of the penitentiary. 
“Our current facility is not fit for human habitation,” Wittman said. “Nobody wants to fund a new prison less than me, but we have a constitutional and moral obligation to not have people live in squalor.”
The prison plan will need two-thirds majority support in the House and Senate, due to a state constitutional provision requiring the higher threshold for bills appropriating money.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EM8A1873-1024x745.jpg,,,2025-09-17 18:57:10.668528

Chief Michael Peeler said he could not answer several questions about the investigation into the death of 21-year-old Demartravion “Trey” Reed of Grenada, Mississippi. The tragedy swiftly captured the scrutiny of the state and the nation, with some speculating that this was another example of Mississippi’s racist history of lynching of Black people.
However, the chief stood by his earlier statements that there appeared to be no foul play. Peeler said he was the second officer from the Delta State Police Department on the scene after Reed was found, and he saw the body.

Bolivar County Coroner Randolph “Rudy” Seals Jr. said Monday that Reed had no broken bones and did not appear to have been assaulted.
Mississippi’s Chief Medical Examiner Staci Turner was conducting an autopsy of Reed’s body, and preliminary results should be released within two days, Peeler said Wednesday.
Delta State President Dan Ennis recognized that this case touched a nerve, and he defended the school from accusations of racism.
“Richard Wright said that history comes on us, it surges up and it’s fused and tangled. And so, I acknowledge that this imagery is fused and tangled in people’s identities,” said an emotional Ennis. “Sometimes we can’t unknot it. We can’t untangle it, but here is one of the best places to start to pick at that knot, and to acknowledge that situation and build off of it.”
Law enforcement presence on campus increased after several people made threatening calls to the university. However, Peeler emphasized that campus was safe.

“At this point we don’t have any credible threats that I’m aware of and law enforcement will let me know,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt when someone calls the office and says that this is a terrible place, and that people should be hurt.”
Ennis also addressed a statement from the attorney for Reed’s family that the university did not reach out to them. He said the university had been in contact with the next-of-kin Reed listed on a contact form. Ennis did not reveal who those people were, but said the university would cooperate with any investigation into Reed’s death. 
“I also acknowledge that there is a distinction between next-of-kin and family, and I acknowledge that both next-of-kin and family are grieving,” he said.

Stacy Starling, Reed’s aunt, addressed reporters after the press conference but did not answer any questions.
“We just ask that you continue to just to lift us up in your prayers. We thank you, and God bless each and every one of you,” she said before joining other relatives and friends in a prayer circle.
Reed’s body was found hanging from a tree early Monday near the pickleball courts on campus. Reed’s race and the manner of his death triggered an outcry online about Mississippi’s history of racist violence and rattled the university’s community.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson called for the FBI to investigate Reed’s death. Reed’s family has retained lawyers Ben Crump and Vanessa Jones, and they are launching their own independent investigation.
Reed’s death is being investigated by police from Delta State and Cleveland, the Bolivar County Sheriff’s Department and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.

As more insurers, hospitals and clinicians use artificial intelligence in health care, state legislators on both sides of the aisle are looking to regulate its use. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A bipartisan group of Pennsylvania state legislators recently hatched a plan to regulate the use of artificial intelligence in health care.
Four Pennsylvania House Democrats and one House Republican plan to introduce legislation that would require insurers, hospitals and other providers to follow certain rules when using AI for patient care, billing and coding, claims processing and other health-related services.
“As the only physician in the [Pennsylvania] General Assembly, I have seen the rapid growth of AI usage in health care in real time,” said Democratic Pennsylvania state Rep. Arvind Venkat in a statement announcing the legislation. Venkat is an emergency medicine physician in Pittsburgh.
Venkat said that while AI has increased efficiency in administrative tasks for physicians like himself, he’s concerned about its growing use in decision-making about patient care and whether health services are covered by insurance.
This year alone, more than a dozen states have passed laws regulating AI in health care, according to Manatt Health, a national health services firm.
Arizona, Maryland, Nebraska and Texas now ban insurance companies from using AI as the sole decision-maker in prior authorization or medical necessity denials. Nevada and Oregon prohibit AI from representing itself as a health care provider, while several other states — including Utah and New York —  have regulated the use of AI-enabled chat bots in mental health.
State AI legislation has been sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans and has been approved with bipartisan support, a reflection of broad concerns over its expanding use in health care.
California, New York could become first states to enact laws aiming to prevent catastrophic AI harm

The Pennsylvania lawmakers say their proposed legislation would force insurers and health care providers to be transparent about how they use AI; require a human to make the final decision any time AI is used: and mandate that insurers and providers to show evidence of minimizing bias in their use of AI.
“As AI use has grown in the health care industry, we have already seen evidence that AI usage can reinforce bias and discrimination,” Venkat said in a statement. “This will allow us to ensure that insurers, clinicians and hospitals use AI effectively and do not use it to perpetuate potentially harmful biases in the medical field.”
More than half of American patients say AI in health needs more oversight, according to an August poll from the United States of Care, a nonprofit focused on affordable and accessible health care. Meanwhile, more than two-thirds of physicians have reported an increase in AI use for administrative tasks like recording and managing patient information, and nearly half reported using AI more frequently in patient care and clinical decision-making.
National groups including the American Medical Association have also called for more oversight of AI. Last year, physician use of AI more than doubled, according to the latest data from the association.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/ Rhode Island Current)House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale is calling for an audit of the quasi-governmental agency that finances affordable home construction, claiming administrative bloat has hindered its mission of tackling Rhode Island’s housing crisis.
The Foster Republican on Wednesday suggested RIHousing is another example of why the state needs to create an office of inspector general to root out waste and fraud, despite the fact that the agency has posted audited financial statements on its website for the past 16 years. 
House Republicans released the fruits of their own investigation, in a six-page report Chippendale handed out to reporters gathered for a press conference in his State House office. The report compared RIHousing’s budget to its peers across New England.
“What we found was nothing short of shocking,” Chippendale said. He accused the agency of being an “upper middle class job creation program” while production stagnates.
The analysis conducted by House Minority Office staff found that RIHousing had among the second highest approximate combined administrative and personnel costs in the region at $46.4 million. 
When scaled to 10,000 residents, it was about $417,400 — nearly $60,000 higher than Vermont. When compared to MassHousing, the report found a disparity of over $300,000 per 10,000 residents.
Looking at total operating expenses over total program spending, House Republicans found that of the total $52.3 million RIHousing operating budget for fiscal year 2026, only $7.2 million would go toward program spending.
“A 7:1 ratio of overhead to output,” Chippendale said. “At a minimum, this reflects gross inefficiency.”
RIHousing has approximately 237 employees. The House GOP’s report said it is the second highest in the region after MassHousing with 363 people on staff.
RIHousing Executive Director Carole Ventura expressed her disappointment over the House Minority Office brief, which she said lacked an understanding of the agency’s significant workload.
“It’s disappointing to see political talking points mischaracterize and malign the work of an industry and agency that continues to deliver thousands of affordable homes to our state amid a historic housing crisis,” Ventura said in a statement released to Rhode Island Current late Wednesday.
“RIHousing is an award-winning housing finance agency which performs more functions than many peer agencies in larger states, and which has been recognized many times by its fellow HFAs for its innovative programs and the scope of its impact. Over the last five years, Ventura said RIHousing has invested roughly $1.6 billion into housing development and financed over 5,600 homes for Rhode Islanders.
RIHousing undergoes an annual audit of compliance with federal regulations for all major federal programs in accordance with Federal requirements conducted by an independent audit firm approved by the state’s auditor general, Ventura added. A page on the agency’s website has audited financial statements going back to 2009.










It’s disappointing to see political talking points mischaracterize and malign the work of an industry and agency that continues to deliver thousands of affordable homes to our state amid a historic housing crisis.


– Carole Ventura, executive director, RIHousing


“Every program we run is subject to rules and regulations, public input, and oversight by numerous bodies and independent audits,” Ventura said. “Every project we finance is subject to a transparent process and scoring, rigorous underwriting, third-party cost analyses, state and municipal approvals and, approval by the agency’s Board of Commissioners. Every activity we undertake, every hire we make and every dollar we spend is accounted for publicly and reported on routinely.”
Chippendale claimed the state will not get the return on investment needed to make a dent in the estimated 26,000-unit affordable housing shortage across the state.
He cited an October 2024 Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC) report as the prime example for the state’s shortcomings. The report found even though the state had committed $273 million toward new home construction, it would only yield about 1,600 new units.
“The only conclusion that can be drawn is that there are tremendous inefficiencies and flaws in our approach to development and funding of housing,” Chippendale said. 
“Development of affordable housing is complex and subject to review at every stage,” Ventura said. “Development budgets reflect real factors in the market, like land, cost of materials, cost of labor, building code requirements and other regulatory compliance, environmental work, accessibility requirements and more – not agency profit. To suggest otherwise is baseless, does a disservice to the real work being done by this agency during an unprecedented housing crisis and dismissive of the dedication and oversight of our Board of Commissioners.”
Chippendale said he has asked House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi to have the General Assembly’s Auditor General look into a full performance review of RIHousing. House spokesperson Larry Berman confirmed Wednesday afternoon Shekarchi received an informal request from Chippendale. 
If Chippendale were to put something down in writing, Berman said Shekarchi will look to schedule a meeting of the Joint Committee on Legislative Services, which Chippendale sits on, within the next couple of months.
The 20-member Special Legislative Commission on Housing Affordability — which includes Chippendale —  is scheduled Thursday afternoon to hear from RIHousing leaders about recent development activity and investments to boost the state’s housing stock.
That presentation will come just after Housing Secretary Deborah Goddard, who sits on both the commission and chairs RIHousing’s board of directors, delivers a status report on the state’s 2030 plan and housing production.
But Chippendale said he will be skipping the meeting in order to babysit his 2-month-old grandson.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Pennsylvania has joined a coalition of northeastern states in an effort to develop public health and immunization guidelines amid concerns about the direction of federal health agencies.
The group will meet regularly to coordinate on public health efforts such as emergency preparedness and the creation of immunization guidelines.
“Pennsylvania is participating in the bipartisan Northeast Public Health Collaborative (NEPHC) because the Shapiro Administration is committed to keeping Pennsylvanians healthy, preventing injury and disease, and ensuring the safe delivery of quality health care throughout the Commonwealth,” Barry Ciccocioppo, communications director for the state Department of Health, said in a statement. “To meet our mission and ensure Pennsylvanians have access to essential public health resources, members of the Department of Health work with colleagues in other states and jurisdictions to share innovations, best practices, and improve efficiency.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Other states involved include Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. All have Democratic governors, except Vermont which is run by Republican Phil Scott.
The move follows a similar action taken by West Coast states, California, Oregon and Washington, who formed their own public health coalition.
Historically, almost all U.S. states, including Pennsylvania, have accepted immunization guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). However, changes at the agency under President Donald Trump and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including the firing of its director, have shaken the trust of public health experts.
“States have had to step forward basically into the breach and fill the void left by a gutted CDC and the dismantling of public health infrastructure at the federal government level,” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey told NPR recently.
Nine former directors of the CDC also raised alarms about the direction of the agency under Kennedy, its defunding of medical research, and the trustworthiness of its public health recommendations in a New York Times op-ed.
Earlier this month, the Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy, which is responsible for determining when and to whom Pennsylvania pharmacists can administer vaccines, also voted to accept immunization recommendations from non-government health organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
Pa.  Board of Pharmacy votes to use vaccine guidelines from non-government groups

The move effectively allowed them to bypass guidance from the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, amid concerns that the group has been politicized.
Kennedy, a longtime proponent of antivaccine views and the former chair of an antivaccine advocacy group, removed and replaced all 17 members of the CDC’s immunization advisory panel, appointing a number who have voiced concerns about the safety and efficacy of vaccines in a break from widespread scientific consensus. The panel is scheduled to meet this week and vote on recommendations for this year’s COVID-19 shot and other vaccines.
The Pennsylvania Department of Health, Department of Human Services and Insurance Commission submitted a joint public comment to the panel ahead of their meeting that said, “Immunization remains one of the most powerful and cost-effective tools for preventing serious illnesses, reducing hospitalizations, and protecting those most vulnerable to severe outcomes.”
“Consistent and science-driven recommendations from ACIP are therefore essential to preserving both individual autonomy and collective well-being,” the letter added.

Andrew Nixon, the communications director of the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, responded to concerns about changes to the department in a statement to the Capital-Star.
“The American people voted for transparency and accountability, and that’s exactly what Secretary Kennedy is delivering,” he wrote. “For decades, CDC failed to level with the public. We are reforming broken institutions, restoring gold standard science as the foundation of public health, and empowering Americans with honest information and real choice. That is how we rebuild trust and Make America Healthy Again.”
Nixon also criticized states like Pennsylvania that are seeking to bypass the CDC’s vaccine recommendations.
“Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people’s trust in public health agencies,” he said. “ACIP remains the scientific body guiding immunization recommendations in this country, and HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/COVID-vaccines-states.jpg,,,2025-09-17 18:57:10.668528

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The city of Fayetteville is violating a law prohibiting “sanctuary policy” and is therefore ineligible to receive discretionary funding administered by the state, according to an opinion released by the Arkansas attorney general Wednesday. 
The opinion was requested by Rep. Kendon Underwood, a Cave Springs Republican who claimed in June that the city violated the state law after the mayor issued a news release clarifying the Fayetteville Police Department’s role in an Arkansas State Police traffic stop that involved federal immigration enforcement, the Fayetteville Flyer reported. 
Underwood expressed his appreciation for the attorney general’s work and sent letters Wednesday to the governor and the Department of Finance and Administration’s secretary requesting they withhold all discretionary funds to the city of Fayetteville until it comes into compliance with state law, according to a news release. He also sent letters to the co-chairs of the Arkansas Legislative Council requesting the committee’s support. 
“It is unfortunate that the city is jeopardizing its funding because of the radical left politics and posturing of the mayor, but the Legislature has spoken and we will not tolerate dangerous sanctuary city policies that make Arkansans less safe,” Underwood said. “I am hopeful that the mayor will reverse course, but until then I will do everything in my power to ensure the law is enforced and funding is withheld from Fayetteville.”
Arkansas governor orders National Guard to assist ICE with immigration enforcement

Mayor Molly Rawn sent a letter Wednesday to city council members and Fayetteville’s police chief clarifying that it’s the city’s policy “to fully comply” with all state laws, including the statute in question. 
“The City of Fayetteville has never had a written policy that affirms, suggests, or implies the existence of a sanctuary policy,” Rawn said. “However, to avoid any misunderstanding, I want to make it unequivocally clear that my comments should not be interpreted as supporting or establishing a sanctuary policy in violation of A.C.A. § 14-1-103, either now or at any point in the future.”
Tension over immigration policy has heightened under the Trump administration whose crackdown on immigration has included an executive order to revoke federal funding to “sanctuary cities” and an effort to hire more U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 
In Arkansas, state lawmakers passed the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act this spring which, among other things, expanded the state’s current ban on “sanctuary cities,” a term for municipalities that don’t coordinate with federal immigration authorities. The law, whose primary sponsor was Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, applies to counties, cities, unincorporated towns or “any other political subdivision of the state.”
Under the law, local governments can’t adopt policies that prohibit cooperation with federal agencies to verify a person’s immigration status, “grants to illegal immigrants the right to lawful presence or status” in violation of federal law, prevents law enforcement from asking about citizenship or immigration status, restricts cooperation with detainers or other requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or requires ICE to obtain a warrant or demonstrate more than probable cause before complying with detainers or other legal requests to maintain custody of immigrants or transfer their custody to ICE.  
After receiving a complaint from an Arkansas resident or request from a state lawmaker, the attorney general must issue an opinion stating whether a local government violated the law. If a violation is determined, the local government is ineligible to receive discretionary funding provided by the state until the attorney general certifies the sanctuary policy is repealed or no longer in effect. Discretionary funding is not mandatory and refers to money that is provided through funds or grants administered by the state.
The law allows the local government to appeal the decision in Pulaski County Circuit Court.

In Wednesday’s opinion, Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office sent a letter to Fayetteville’s city attorney on June 27 requesting copies of city ordinances or policies related to the statute in question. While Griffin was provided with “numerous documents,” the most relevant was a statement from Rawn that indicated “FPD does not participate in civil immigration enforcement violations,” he said.
The Fayetteville Police Department received a request from Arkansas State Police related to a traffic stop near I-49 and Exit 64 on the morning of June 17, according to a news release from the city. A Fayetteville police sergeant responded and observed both ASP and ICE personnel, but had no further involvement and left the scene. Fayetteville PD had not been contacted by ICE or other agencies regarding immigration enforcement operations in the city, according to the release. 
“I want to reaffirm clearly: The City of Fayetteville does not assist ICE in carrying out its agenda,” Rawn said in the release. “Our police department’s role is to keep our community safe, not to act as agents of immigration enforcement.”
Griffin wrote in his opinion that the mayor’s statement, which said it “reiterated the city’s position,” reflects a preexisting policy and that violates the state’s sanctuary policy law. 
The attorney general’s office has exchanged four letters with the city (two sent and two received) seeking information about the city’s existing policies that are relevant to the law, Griffin said. The city believes its policies don’t violate state law or are relevant to the statute, but “that belief is mistaken,” he said.

“The City may submit evidence demonstrating that the sanctuary policy is no longer current or that exceptions have been made that would allow City employees to comply with the statute,” Griffin wrote. “If that evidence is submitted, the City will be eligible to receive the discretionary funds again.”
Fayetteville City Attorney Kit Williams argued in a June 18 letter to the mayor and city council addressing Underwood’s complaint that he did not believe Rawn’s statement violated the law. Williams wrote that Fayetteville “has long scrupulously followed and obeyed the sanctuary policies prohibited law,” but the law doesn’t require Fayetteville police officers to act as immigration enforcement agents. 
Furthermore, Williams argued, state law does not require the city to “assist ICE in carrying out its agenda,” which includes many things including “searching for, arresting and detaining illegal immigrants.”
“Since the City of Fayetteville does not have knowledge of the illegal immigrant status of residents, nor do we have any city detention facilities where a suspected illegal immigrant might be housed and then transferred to ICE custody, the city cannot assist ICE in its agenda,” Williams wrote.

(Screenshot from livestream)Arkansas PBS’ governing board on Wednesday nominated state Rep. Carlton Wing to take over the agency as CEO and executive director, pending approval from Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Wing, a North Little Rock Republican and House Speaker Pro Tempore, would replace Courtney Pledger, who resigned in April after eight years at the helm of the public television network.
If confirmed, Wing would be required to resign from the Arkansas Legislature, triggering a special election to finish his term through 2027. Wing announced in June that he would not run for reelection to a sixth term in 2026.

In an email, Wing said interim executive director Sajni Kumpuris asked him if he would be interested in running the agency. Wing and his wife, Leigh, co-founded the video production company Wing Media Group. He also is a former sports broadcaster for KARK.
The Arkansas PBS Commission approved Wing’s nomination with no dissent after more than an hour of discussion in executive session. As of Wednesday afternoon, Arkansas PBS spokespeople had not responded to an email asking how many applicants the commission considered.
If confirmed, Wing would be Arkansas PBS’ third tie to Republican state lawmakers in less than two years. In June 2024, Sanders appointed Maria Sullivan, wife of a state senator, to the commission.
Wednesday’s quarterly commission meeting was the first for its newest member, former state Rep. Charlene Fite, a Van Buren Republican who left office in January after declining to run for a seventh term last year. Her term on the commission will expire in 2032, a year after Sullivan’s.
Fite’s appointment has yet to be formally announced by Sanders’ office. She replaces former commission chairman West Doss, whose term expired in 2024 but who continued to serve in the absence of a replacement. Vice Chairman Woody Freeman conducted Wednesday’s meeting, and the commission did not yet choose a new chair.

Arkansas House passes PBS appropriation after three votes for second consecutive fiscal session


Sullivan’s husband is Jonesboro Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan, the Legislature’s most vocal critic of Arkansas PBS. He unsuccessfully tried to reduce Arkansas PBS’ spending authority in the 2022 and 2024 fiscal sessions.
Arkansas PBS’ spending authority has repeatedly faced resistance in the Arkansas House. Wing was among the lawmakers who urged their colleagues to pass the network’s appropriation bill in 2024, when the bill passed after three attempts. The appropriation took five attempts to pass the House this year.
 Funding discussion

Sullivan introduced a bill in February that would have dissolved the PBS Commission, but he and Doss said in March that they reached an agreement for Sullivan to leave the commission alone.
Transferring the commission’s duties to the state Department of Education would have jeopardized Arkansas PBS’ funding via grants and donations, Pledger told lawmakers in February, urging them not to pass Sullivan’s bill.
Arkansas PBS lost $2.5 million in programming and operational funds after the Corporation for Public Broadcasting lost federal funding this summer. CPB announced in August that the majority of staff positions would conclude on Sept. 30, with a small transition team staying on until January 2026. The community service grant from CPB accounted for 51% of the Arkansas PBS’ operating expense funding, Kumpuris told the commission at a special meeting in June.

Corporation for Public Broadcasting to close its doors after loss of funding

 

The commission decided at that meeting to renew its federal PBS affiliation. Renewal allowed the agency to continue purchasing PBS programs to air, some of which is chosen by PBS’ national headquarters. Losing this programming would have led to a drop in donations even though forgoing the renewal would have saved the state agency $2.3 million in national dues, which it usually pays with federal funds, said Marge Betley, CEO of the Arkansas PBS Foundation.
Since June, the Foundation has provided the network with a “one-time emergency fund” of $1.5 million, supporting both operating expenses and about half of the national dues, Kumpuris said Wednesday.
“We’re grateful for the Foundation giving us this time to adjust,” she said. “There are some PBS networks that didn’t get that time.”
The financial aid meant the network only had to use about $500,000 more of its reserve funding than it did for fiscal year 2025, Kumpuris said, and she and other agency officials found ways to reduce expenses by $1 million without impairing network operations.
Kumpuris also said she and Betley are discussing the option of the Foundation covering the entirety of the network’s dues in fiscal year 2027.
“That’s really what our donors give for, primarily with membership, is to support those PBS dues,” Betley said. “That’s one of the primary messages that we send to them when we’re asking for their support [and] that’s the intention of the individual fundraising that we do.”

Ron DeSantis moving to eliminate vaccine mandates from Florida statutes, rules, and regulations, some health care advocates worry that costs of vaccines won’t be covered for patients.
Meanwhile, the Florida Department of Health continues to keep quiet about whether it will hold a public hearing on a proposal to remove vaccination requirements for public and private school grades kindergarten through 12, day care centers, and adult education courses.
The issue of vaccines and insurance coverage was broached during a Florida Voices for Health statewide advocacy virtual meeting Wednesday. A coalition of community organizations, businesses, and individuals, Florida Voices for Health works to expand availability of health care services.
“What I am noticing as a consumer in both transgender prescriptions and in advocacy for people with disabilities, like, major life-preserving medications are being withheld just on the suggestion of executive orders,” one participant said. “And the issue is insurance carriers. It doesn’t even need to be in law for them to save money and not pay for things.”
AHIP — the national health insurance industry trade association — though, says insurers won’t halt payments for vaccinations any time soon.
“Health plans are committed to maintaining and ensuring affordable access to vaccines. Health plan coverage decisions for immunizations are grounded in each plan’s ongoing, rigorous review of scientific and clinical evidence, and continual evaluation of multiple sources of data,” the organization said in a written statement.
“Health plans will continue to cover all (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) ACIP-recommended immunizations that were recommended as of September 1, 2025, including updated formulations of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, with no cost-sharing for patients through the end of 2026.
“While health plans continue to operate in an environment shaped by federal and state laws, as well as program and customer requirements, the evidence-based approach to coverage of immunizations will remain consistent.”

Disappearing mandate?
The DeSantis administration made national headlines earlier this month when state Surgeon General and Department of Health Secretary Joseph Ladapo said he’d like to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes and rules, a move that could affect schoolchildren but also college students and even nursing home residents. Ladapo said at the time that mandates drip “with disdain and slavery.” 
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website says that “vaccines can prevent infectious diseases that once killed or harmed many infants, children, and adults.” It also says, “The disease-prevention benefits of getting vaccines are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children. The only exceptions to this are cases in which a child has a serious chronic medical condition like cancer or a disease that weakens the immune system, or has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous vaccine dose.”
The  Florida Phoenix asked the DOH Tuesday whether it will hold a public meeting on its proposed rule change regarding vaccines. The DOH announced last week that it was updating its immunization requirements and forms for childcare and school admission, plus opt-out provisions, in the Florida Administrative Register.
The Florida Chapter of the American College of Physicians and the Florida Academy of Family Physicians have asked the DOH to hold a meeting on its proposed new rules but the department hasn’t formally announced whether it intends to do so. Ladapo isn’t required to hold a public meeting if he deems it unnecessary.
Regardless, the Florida Board of Pharmacy appears poised to tackle the issue. The nine-member board meets virtually next week to discuss its rules regarding COVID-19 and other vaccinations. The Board of Pharmacy is housed in the DOH, which Ladapo runs, and its members are appointed by the governor.

“Two young, handsome Friesians have joined my herd,” the media personality wrote on social media last week.

Lifestyle and homemaking media mogul Martha Stewart has provided a “forever home” to two Friesian gelding horses seized from a Vermont farm as part of an ongoing animal cruelty case, according to an animal rescue director.
The state has confiscated 74 horses from the Friesians of Majesty horse farm in Townshend over the course of two years, and horse owner Robert Labrie is facing charges related to animal cruelty and violation of his conditions of release. 
First reported by the Brattleboro Reformer, Martha Stewart took in the two horses — named Ulysses and Stewart — last Friday at her estate Cantitoe Corners in New York.
“Two young, handsome Friesians have joined my herd,” Stewart wrote in an Instagram post Sunday. “Three-year old Ulysses and 10-year-old Stewart, were removed from a neglectful facility and brought to Dorset Equine Rescue in Vermont where they could get the care and attention they needed until they could be properly re-homed.”
Stewart’s barn manager contacted Dorset Equine Rescue after the first seizure of horses in 2023 expressing the celebrity’s interest in adoption, but the organization could not make the arrangement at the time due to pending litigation, said Jen Straub, executive director of the rescue. 
Ulysses was adopted outright by Stewart after the Friesian gelding was taken in the first seizure and had been forfeited. The second Friesian horse, called Stewart, is being fostered by his namesake, Straub said.

After the forfeiture is sealed, Stewart intends to adopt the 10-year-old gelding, Straub said. An “animal lover,” Stewart already had four Friesians, five miniature donkeys, dogs and cats on a farm in Katonah, a hamlet of Bedford, New York, Straub said.
Ulysses was a yearling when the rescue first received him, but he was small for his age, emaciated, feverish, dehydrated and displayed signs of colic, said Tiffany Vittum, the barn manager for Dorset Equine Rescue. 
After Ulysses was sent to the hospital, the horse was diagnosed with a condition called pyloric stenosis, an intestinal issue that prevents feed from properly passing through from the stomach to the intestine. 
“He would have died from this,” Vittum said. “The vets did not think that this was ever going to change. It was just going to be a lifetime diagnosis, but with a couple of years of proper treatment and proper feeding and just lots of growing and proper nourishment, he actually was able to overcome it.”
When seized earlier this year, the horse Stewart was emaciated and hospitalized due to several dental issues where he received treatment for several weeks, Vittum said. 
“He was born with poor jaw conformation, but the neglect only enhanced it,” Vittum said. “He’s going to need routine, more regular dental work than the average horse. But once we got that taken care of, he was able to go on a pretty normal horse diet of grain and hay, and his weight improved immediately.”
Dorset Equine Rescue has helped with recovery, care and placement of the 74 horses seized from Friesians of Majesty horse farm in the past two years, and facilitated the adoption of over a of the dozen horses since forfeited, Straub said. 
Steven Brown, Windham County state’s attorney, said the forfeiture of horses seized in 2023 has long since been completed. Brown said Windham County Superior Court Judge John Treadwell ordered the forfeiture of 19 of the 20 horses seized in 2024, reported by the Brattleboro Reformer in August. That means the adoption process may commence for those 19 horses as well, Brown said. 
The next step in the case is the forfeiture hearing for the 39 horses seized in June this year, and then Labrie will stand trial for the animal cruelty charges against him, Brown said.
Brown expressed gratitude to Dorset Equine Rescue for assisting the state and law enforcement during the seizures and caring for horses while the forfeitures are litigated. 
“They’ve been an outstanding partner to us, and have gone way above and beyond what we ever could have asked for in terms of care they’re providing and their work in this case,” Brown said. “The public should be aware that they are not receiving any public funds for this work. It’s all based off of donations, and we really appreciate what they do.”

A majority of the five-member commission fired Howard Knapp out of a desire for new leadership, according to a statement by Chairman Dennis Shedd.
Shedd also said the decision was “unrelated to the conduct of any election in South Carolina.”
“The Commission’s leadership and staff remain dedicated to ensuring South Carolina’s elections are accurate, secure, and accessible,” Shedd said.
The commission declined to make any further comment.
Knapp’s firing, effective immediately, comes amid a lawsuit trying to stop the Election Commission from providing the information of about 3.3 million registered voters to the U.S. Department of Justice over privacy concerns.
In an opinion earlier this month, the state Supreme Court overruled a circuit court’s pause on providing that information, clearing the way for the commission to begin handing over names, birthdays, addresses, driver’s license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers.
Knapp was named the state’s chief election official in 2022 and confirmed by the state Senate in 2023. He earned an annual salary of $150,000.
Knapp also remains the subject of an ongoing investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, according to agency spokeswoman Renee Wunderlich.
In March 2024, SLED launched the investigation into unspecified allegations of misconduct at the request of the state attorney general’s office.
The commission appointed Chief of Staff Jenny Wooten as interim executive director.
